            <p><p>The following audio from a Glenn Beck show is illustrative of many
things. Although he demonstrates incredible ignonance of evolution in
this clip, he makes some good points...they just aren't the points he
thinks he's making.</p>
<p><a href="http://cloudfront.mediamatters.org/static/flash/player.swf">http://cloudfront.mediamatters.org/static/flash/player.swf</a></p>
<p>His main points are the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>"I don't know why it is unreasonable to say this...I'm not God, so I
    don't know how God creates...I don't think we came from monkeys...I
    think that's ridiculous...I haven't seen a half-monkey-half-person
    yet...did evolution just stop?"</li>
<li>"They have to force [the idea of evolution] down your throat...when
    anybody has to force it, it's a problem...you didn't have to force
    that the world is round...[...]...you don't have to force the
    truth..you just keep adding evidence and evidence until it becomes
    self-evident."</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, point (1) demonstrates a profound ignorance, willful or otherwise,
of the claims of evolution.  First, no biologist says we came from
monkeys...monkeys and people are just as "evolved" as each other, and
that they share a common ancestor which would have both features of
monkey and human.  We have many of these transitional fossils (for a
very nice summary see the <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-transitional.html">Transitional Fossil FAQ</a>).  It's really
such an elementary error, that he should be thrown off the air just for
spreading such ignorance.</p>
<p>However, I would like to focus on point (2) which perhaps seems
reasonable: that truth should be self evident, and not have to be
forced.  In a way, one might think that science works this way because
everything should be repeatable, and we don't take arguments from
authority.  However, there is a problem.  Although it is true that the
fact that the world is round did not have to be forced (in contrast to
the bogus propaganda story about Columbus demonstrating it), one does
need to actually <strong>look</strong> at the facts in order to be able to
judge...truth can be self evident but it requires one to actually look
at the evidence.  Take evolution, for example.  If you look at the
genetic data showing the differences in base-pair counts between
animals, this single number mapped out for all animals demonstrates a
tree structure (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_descent">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_descent</a>
and <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/section1.html">http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/section1.html</a>).  Now
recall that Darwin did not know anything about genetics, so this is a
prediction made 50+ years before the measurements.  When you actually
look at the evidence for evolution it is absolutely self evident.  The
problem is several-fold:</p>
<ol>
<li>people refuse to even look at the evidence, choosing instead to
    willfully remain ignorant thinking they understand it.</li>
<li>There is a certain amount of technical information necessary to
    understand any science, and that takes work.  If you don't want to
    do that work then you'll remain ignorant of it.  As an extreme
    example, quantum mechanics is definitely true, but it neither self
    evident nor intuitive (and I don't see conservative talking heads
    railing against it)</li>
</ol>
<p>What's the solution?  I'm not sure, but challenging people to learn is a
start.</p>
