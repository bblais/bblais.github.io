&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://statweb.stanford.edu/~ckirby/brad/other/2013Perspective.pdf"&gt;http://statweb.stanford.edu/~ckirby/brad/other/2013Perspective.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we have the following text:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Controversial theorem” sounds like an oxymoron, but Bayes’ Rule has played this
part for two and a half centuries. Twice it has soared to scientific celebrity, twice it has crashed,
and it is currently enjoying another boom. The Theorem itself is a landmark of logical reasoning
and the first serious triumph of statistical inference, yet is still treated with suspicion by a
majority of statisticians. There are reasons to believe in the staying power of its current
popularity, but also some worrisome signs of trouble ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a simple but genuine example of the Rule in action (1). A physicist couple I know
learned, from sonograms, that they were due to be parents of twin boys. “What is the probability
our twins will be Identical rather than Fraternal?” was their question. There are two pieces of
relevant evidence: only one-third of twins are Identical; on the other hand, Identicals are twice as
likely to yield twin boy sonograms, since they are always same-sex while Fraternals are 50/50.
Putting this together, the Rule correctly concludes that in this case the two pieces balance out,
and that the odds of Identical are even. Note: the twins were fraternal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trouble and the
subsequent busts came from overenthusiastic application of the Theorem in the absence of
genuine prior information, with Laplace as a prime violator. Suppose that in the twins example
we lacked the “one-third Identicals” prior knowledge. Laplace would have casually assumed a
uniform distribution between zero and one for the unknown prior probability of Identical
(yielding 2/3 rather than 1/2 as the answer to the physicists’ question.) In modern parlance,
Laplace would be trying to assign an “uninformative prior,” one having only neutral effects on
the output of Bayes’ rule (3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-original-calculation-with-knowledge"&gt;The original calculation, with knowledge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, let's start with the following knowledge and some notation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we've observed twin boy sonograms, a proposition denoted as &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(S\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1/3 of twins are identical, thus &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(I) \equiv q = 1/3\)&lt;/span&gt;.  You'll see why I use &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(q\)&lt;/span&gt; later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are interested in &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(I|S)\)&lt;/span&gt;.  We can derive a few related probabilities, like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(S|I) = 1/2\)&lt;/span&gt;.  This comes from the notion that identical twins must be either BB or GG, and only half of them would give twin &lt;em&gt;boy&lt;/em&gt; sonograms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(S|\sim I) = 1/4\)&lt;/span&gt;. This comes from the notion that fraternal twins must be BB, BG, GB or GG, and only 1/4 of them would give twin &lt;em&gt;boy&lt;/em&gt; sonograms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting the calculation in terms of odds ratios (which I don't like as much as direct probabilities), we get&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{P(I|S)}{P(\sim I|S)} &amp;amp;=&amp;amp; \frac{P(S|I)P(I)}{P(S|\sim I)P(\sim I)} \\
&amp;amp;=&amp;amp; \frac{1/2 \times 1/3}{1/4 \times (1-1/3)} = 1
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
or 1:1 odds, and thus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$P(I|S)=1/2$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-would-laplace-do"&gt;What would Laplace do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The text refers to an "uninformative prior", in a derogatory way, and then proceeds to mistakenly use an &lt;em&gt;informative&lt;/em&gt;, incorrect prior and attribute it to Laplace.  Laplace, &lt;a href="http://web.bryant.edu/~bblais/misquoting-hume.html"&gt;like Hume&lt;/a&gt;, is mischaracterized so often it really is remarkable.  Let's follow through how the text gets the &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(S|I)=2/3\)&lt;/span&gt; presumably what Laplace would do.  To get this, we assume that there are two states (identical and fraternal) and that uninformative means equal probability to these states.  Thus the prior is &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(I)=1/2\)&lt;/span&gt;, and the same calculation proceeds as &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{P(I|S)}{P(\sim I|S)} &amp;amp;=&amp;amp; \frac{P(S|I)P(I)}{P(S|\sim I)P(\sim I)} \\
&amp;amp;=&amp;amp; \frac{1/2 \times 1/2}{1/4 \times (1-1/2)} = 2
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
or 2:1 odds and thus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$P(I|S)=2/3$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author then implies that this is clearly wrong, even though it does make sense that different knowledge &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; lead to different probability assignments.  Regardless, the author calls Laplace the "prime violator" of the "overenthusiastic application" of Bayes Theorem, where Laplace "casually assumed a uniform distribution" for the probability of getting identical twins. However I would say that this is the &lt;em&gt;correct&lt;/em&gt; thing to do when one has no information - to do otherwise &lt;em&gt;inserts&lt;/em&gt; unjustified information into the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-would-laplace-really-do"&gt;What would Laplace &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's assume Laplace is really starting from scratch, and can't even estimate the number of twins well, so he does use a uniform distribution on &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(q\)&lt;/span&gt; above.  The proper calculation then is to &lt;em&gt;marginalize&lt;/em&gt; over this uniform distribution.  Applying Bayes Theorem, we get&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
P(I|S) &amp;amp;=&amp;amp; \int_0^1 \frac{P(S|I) \cdot q}{P(S|I)\cdot q + P(S|\sim I)\cdot (1-q)} P(q) dq
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As above we have&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(S|I) = 1/2\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(S|\sim I) = 1/4\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(q) =\)&lt;/span&gt; uniform from 0 to 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and so we get (with some &lt;a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=integrate+1%2F2*q%2F%5B1%2F4*q%2B1%2F4%5D+for+q+from+0+to+1"&gt;Wolfram Alpha magic&lt;/a&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
P(I|S) &amp;amp;=&amp;amp; \int_0^1 \frac{1/2 \cdot q}{1/2\cdot q + 1/4\cdot (1-q)} dq = 2-\log 4 \approx 0.614
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;again, different than our informed probability, but also different than assuming that identical twins must occur 50% of the time.  Essentially, by not knowing that identical twins are actually as rare as 1/3 of all twins, we will overestimate the probability that a pair of boy sonograms would be identical - this is a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; thing, not a bad one.  To do otherwise would be assuming knowledge we don't have (at the time).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-would-laplace-do-next"&gt;What would Laplace do &lt;em&gt;next&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like a good scientist, Laplace would probably follow this line of logic with some data taking.  Imagine he observes &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(h\)&lt;/span&gt; identical twins in &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(N\)&lt;/span&gt; twins, he would change his uniform distribution to a Beta distribution - just like a coin flip.  The calculation now looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
P(I|S) &amp;amp;=&amp;amp; \int_0^1 \frac{1/2 \cdot q}{1/2\cdot q + 1/4\cdot (1-q)} {\rm Beta}(h+1,N+1) dq 
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which is easiest done numerically.  Using the sie library from &lt;a href="http://web.bryant.edu/~bblais/statistical-inference-for-everyone-sie.html"&gt;my book&lt;/a&gt; I have for &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(h=0\)&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(N=0\)&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;beta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;linspace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;dq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;pq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pdf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;f = 0.614&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;matching our analytical calculation.  Now, with a modest 30 sets of twins, 10 of which are identical (consistent with our modern observations), we have&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;beta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;linspace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;dq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;pq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pdf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;f = 0.506&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or within 1% of the modern value.  So Laplace would have arrived at a perfectly reasonable answer prior to looking at the data and a well-informed answer within one visit to a French hospital.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what is the objection to Bayes' Theorem again?&lt;/p&gt;

It is common to have student evaluations performed at the end of the semester, and there are endless debates about their value.  I try to take the evaluations seriously, usually trying to glean some general places where I can improve things.  I figured I’d try something a bit different here.  I’m posting the full response to the question “What are your comments regarding the instructor of the course?” from one of my 200-level Weather and Natural Disasters sections.  It is a course which satisfies a general education requirement at the foundational level, and typically focusses on the analysis of weather, climate, and disaster data.  It introduces and reinforces notions of plotting data, regression, interpretation of data, reading contour maps, etc…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s an interesting and somewhat entertaining read.  I don’t take the negative evaluations personally, always trying to see the kernel of truth or where the student might be coming from.  My question here is, what should I do with responses like this?  You may notice a few conflicting viewpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Though tough and giving a lot of work, Brian Blais is always ready to help students who will ask questions. He explains the material really well, and takes his time to answer many questions in class. I sometimes had a hard time linking the different chapters we did though. But he used different ways of making us understand the class by analyzing different documentaries for example, and tried to vary the form our assignments should take which is pretty interesting. I would recommend this professor to others because he is very helpful, but would warn them that he gives a lot of work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If everyone in the class gets an answer wrong take it off the test. It may be a "good" question but if everyone gets it wrong then it is to good of a question. Also if everyone gets the same question wrong, maybe you should go over it more in class, so that the students actually understand the question. I spent hours on each homework assignment and it was a struggle to complete them correctly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frustrating at times, however always available for extra help, you have to work hard to get a good grade.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;professor blais is smart and engaging and i really enjoy taking his class. i would recommend him to anyone, also his passion for the subject is clearly shown through his enthusiasm in class.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good guy, knows everything basically off the top of his head. Could be a bit more clear with his assignments but overall, good professor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes assumes students know more than they do. Tough to keep up. Homework is painfully difficult which he thinks is good but I just give up on them because I don't understand how to do them. Challenge is good, but sometimes too much is counterproductive to learning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It took a little while getting use to how Blais operated. A couple of times in the beginning of the semester I was taken aback at some of his statements, but it's always a truthful and very straightforward statement; something I was not used to coming from college professors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the instructor does a great job applying this class to real life situation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;decided to not even even use blackboard and put everything on google drive, made it much harder because it was so different then my other classes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For a 200 level course that most if not all students are taking as an elective, it is extremely difficult and the material is not taught in a simple way. The lectures are all over the place sometimes and they are hard to follow. It would be more beneficial to students if you just slowed down and answered our questions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Truly awful, Answers questions with thats a good question.. why are you there if you wont answer the question. There is no need to make an science elective this hard and full of unnecessary work at a business school, we have other stuff we have to put our attention on that we actually want to learn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The instructor is a very nice person. In class I enjoyed having him as a professor. However, I believe because he is so intelligent he will explain topics rapidly with the expectation that the class understands. As a result the class is so confused that they refrain from asking questions. Further more the instructors lectures were very little help when doing home work leading to the great frustrations and long hours trying to understand the homework and figuring out solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Professor is a helpful and was a great resource to myself throughout the semester when questions arose. He can be really sarcastic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please give more clear answers to student's questions, rather than saying "I don't know" to certain questions. If you don't know can you at least try to find out, that's kind of your job......&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I thought the instructor was very tough at first but if you put in the effort his teaching style is very smooth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Professor Blais seems like a pretty laid back person. However, he can sometimes be rude without realizing it, and his "bus policy" is the worst rule I have ever seen by a professor. Some students have appointments with advisors, etc. before his class. He should be understanding of those walking in late. Locking the door is pretty excessive, no? Assignments are too long, but his teaching ability is adequate and he clearly loves his job. I can't say I would recommend him to a friend, though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The instructor of this course is very helpful outside of the classroom, however, during class time he does not provide clear instructions for homework assignments and fails to answer students' questions clearly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obviously the professor is very smart and really knows about what he is teaching, but how he teaches is very confusing and scattered. We sort of jump around from subject to subject so I get confused about what is related to what. The professor also doesn't answer questions clearly and ends up leaving many of us more confused than before. He does not communicate clearly what is expected for assignments so it leaves us guessing and hoping we did it right. He has a good amount of office hours available for extra help but only in the morning which is when many students are in classes so it can be difficult to meet with him outside of class.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Professor Blais is often vague or flippant in answering genuine questions asked by the class and greatly underestimates how long his assignments actually take.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Professor Blais is a really nice guy, considerate to students, loves what he is teaching. I think he needs to better explain the material though because we are most likely hearing all of this for the first time and might not be able to grasp the concepts and connections right away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The professor is very knowledgeable. The topics seem difficult at first, but after a few days the material becomes easier. Believes his class is the only class a student is enrolled in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have actually recommended this class to many of my friends and also the teacher.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unclear or misleading at times, but very enthusiastic about the subject.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assignments need to be improved because the course material did not connect enough between lectures and homework. Also needs to be much more organized. The grading system, well there sometimes isn't a grading system. He just distributes grades based off of aesthetic quality and relative .connection to the student&lt;/li&gt;

I have dealt with Blake’s discussions &lt;a href="the-giunta-dillahunty-debate.html"&gt;here before&lt;/a&gt;, but this time it really jumped out at me what the problem was.  The topic was divine hiddenness, and Blake specifically wanted to address that part of the divine hiddenness problem where God seems to be invisible in every way to non-believers - why does he hide?  You can listen to the debate, jump to 44:40 where he outlines many possibilities for why God might not want to or feel the need to appear to unbelievers.  They include things like “the human might lack the right desire for God” (e.g. to escape punishment) or “some non-theists might form an initial proper relationship with God [if he was revealed to them] but then abandon it later on”.  There is another list of responses from other philosophers Blake gives later in the show, but a more complete exploration can be found at &lt;a href="https://beliefmap.org/god-exists/divine-hiddenness/"&gt;Blake’s website here&lt;/a&gt;.  In each of these cases, the argument goes, God would have good reason not to make himself known. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The response given here is essentially the same response apologists give for the problem of suffering - God may have good reasons you don’t know about.  Fair enough, but that doesn’t give us any reason to actually believe in this being.  I think it is probably true that, give the conception of God that Blake gives, there is sufficient flexibility that &lt;em&gt;any and all&lt;/em&gt; philosophical arguments will fail - one cannot assign either a probability 1 or 0 to the existence of this God.  For me, I don’t really care.  I want a reason to actually believe that something exists;  if someone is making the claim, I want evidence.  This sort of argument might be a first step - maybe God is silent because “some non-theists might form an initial proper relationship with God [if he was revealed to them] but then abandon it later on”.  Ok, but how could you test that?  It may be &lt;em&gt;plausible&lt;/em&gt; yet still false, as are most of the reasonable ideas people come up with.  In science, we don’t finish with the argument, we start with it and ask “how would we know?”  I’ve never heard Blake, or any other apologist, take that next crucial step.  How can you, through some kind of observation, tell the difference between one of these excuses being true and God simply not existing?  How can you, through some kind of &lt;em&gt;observation&lt;/em&gt;, tell the difference between the different reasons purported to explain this hiddenness - given that it is impossible they are all true in all cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Care to try?  &lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Incompetence or Nervousness?</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/incompetence-or-nervousness.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-01-03T00:00:00-05:00</published><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2016-01-03:incompetence-or-nervousness.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been seeing a lot of talk about the supposedly incompetent response by “accident reconstruction expert”, as shown in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYqXlRQrBN4&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt;.  You can read one response in the &lt;a href="http://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/12/29/opinion/verbatim-expert-witness.html"&gt;opinion piece in the NY Times&lt;/a&gt;.  The summary is that the “expert” was supposedly  unable to perform the following calculation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who may be curious about the specific math, let me lay out the numbers. The diagram had a distance the witness measured as 3 and three-sixteenths inches with a scale of 20 feet per inch. The witness said this came to approximately 68 feet. In fact it is 63.75 feet. If the expert witness had taken a few seconds to use his calculator, he could have (hopefully) come to the same conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watched the video, and can confirm that the expert should have done better, but I am not entirely convinced that this is incompetence.  I could imagine someone being nervous about lawyers, feeling that the questions were going to be “gotcha” questions - or at least lead to that - and that you’d want a away to double-check any calculation.  Although looking bad, imagine if he had tried this calculation and (through nervousness) came to an incorrect number.  How bad would that look?  Certainly that would have looked worse.  What if he came to the correct number, but noticed the discrepancy - he’d still want to double-check the numbers through the methods he typically uses.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, once he had decided that the line of questioning was just trying to “get him”, whether he was competent or not, there was no way that he was going to budge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think his incompetence may lay in the fact that he didn’t bring the materials he needed to assess the situation quantitatively.  That seems ridiculous.  What sorts of lessons can we draw from this video?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always bring your materials that you need, if you’re going to be questioned about the details of a result you’ve claimed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be prepared to address the claims on several levels of detail - from the fully quantitative level worthy of a technical report, to a back-of-the-envelope calculation which gets close to it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Listen to the question that someone is actually asking, not the question you think they are asking.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

The point is that arguments are not evidence. He says that in all of the debates that he seen between atheists and theists he's never seen anyone bring up this idea which really should show that the theist has lost the debate from the beginning.  I &lt;a href="http://web.bryant.edu/~bblais/evidence-vs-argument.html"&gt;mentioned it here&lt;/a&gt; when I was looking at Blake Giunta debate with Matt Dillahunty.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some things that you can learn from proofs - such as mathematical proofs. For example you may find a relationship between two things that was unintuitive at first. However I think in the case of the &lt;em&gt;existence&lt;/em&gt; of an actual thing then you can gain no knowledge from philosophy or argumentation or proof. You really need something that's demonstrable, that's repeatable, something that gets around the biases and failings of the human thought process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree wholeheartedly with Mr Deity in stating that science is simply the process people use to bypass the failings of human biases.  I also agree with the idea that the argument is the &lt;em&gt;start&lt;/em&gt;, not the end, of the discussion - the argument serves as a hypothesis.&lt;sup id="fnref:grammar"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:grammar" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;  Given that there are a million different intuitive, simple, logically consistent, wrong hypotheses out there the effort must be made by anyone making a claim to find alternate ways of confirming the claims.&lt;br /&gt;
. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:grammar"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never know whether to use “an” or “a” with hypothesis, either in written form or spoken.  It sounds weird to me either way.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:grammar" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It’s a time for reflection, contemplation, self improvement.  I realize that it is technically just another day, and that one could definitely have any day in the year serve this role, but there still feels like something special for this day.  I try to have some modest New Years resolutions.  Ones I have failed in the past are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lose weight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do a triathlon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ones that I have succeeded in the past are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lose weight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read the entire Bible, cover to cover&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run a 5k&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run a half marathon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read 6 books cover to cover (I have a bad habit of starting books and not finishing them)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, I want to focus on writing.  My hope is to be able to write 300 words a day - that’s only a page of text.  But if I can do it every day, that’s a book!  Mostly, I want to get the habit.  In the spirit of new things, I’m trying &lt;a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php"&gt;Scrivener&lt;/a&gt; as a new editing tool.  I’m not sure if it will work for me, but I do hope to get more blog writing and book writing this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This past semester got totally crazy, as I am to the chair of the department and thus have a lot of new responsibilities.  I am slowly getting used to it, but the end of the semester took all my writing time away.  Now, with a commitment to it, I do think that I can make progress on a number of projects that have been languishing somewhat - including this blog. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the plus side, this year I read &lt;em&gt;The Martian&lt;/em&gt;, and saw the movie, both of which were fantastic.  Definitely a good science movie and book, highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>End of a long semester</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/end-of-a-long-semester.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-12-21T00:00:00-05:00</published><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2015-12-21:end-of-a-long-semester.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, I've been off the blog because of new job duties that overwhelmed me for a while.

&lt;li&gt;Finish and submit a paper on the dynamics of Twitter&lt;/li&gt;

Let me start positive, however.  I really love &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos:_A_Spacetime_Odyssey"&gt;Cosmos&lt;/a&gt;, and feel that Tyson is well cast as the narrator (although I will always be partial to Carl Sagan).  I find, however, that Neil deGrasse Tyson commonly makes glib statements that sound smart at first but then when you think about them they aren't as profound.  One such example is his list of 9 things that he doesn't understand about the movie Interstellar (serious spoilers below).  Most, if not all, of them have ready answers but are presented in a glib manner.  Here is the list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you can poke through a tesseract and touch books, why not just write a note and pass it through.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stars vastly outnumber Black Holes. Why is the best Earthlike planet one that orbits a Black Hole&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who in the universe would ever know the titles of all their books, from behind, on an bookshelf.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How a pickup truck can drive with a flat tire among densely planted corn stalks taller than it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If wormholes exist among our planets, then why can't one open up near Earth instead of Saturn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gotta tell you. Mars (right next door) looks waay safer than those new planets they travelled to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you crack your space helmet yet keep fighting, the Planet's air can't be all that bad for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can't imagine a future where escaping Earth via wormhole is a better plan than just fixing Earth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In this unreal future, they teach unscientific things in science class. Oh, wait. That is real.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take (1), for example.  If you watch the scene you'll notice that a) Cooper doesn't &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; any paper in the scene and b) he's in a space suit - a little challenging to write on paper, even if he had it.  Seriously?  Then there is (3), which is factually incorrect - he doesn't know the titles, he's punches out Morse code (backwards, of course) so that the book and spaces show the dots and dashes.  Even if he needed the titles, there is a famous scene described in Gleick's book &lt;em&gt;Genius&lt;/em&gt; where Richard Feynman and Julian Schwinger at a party both rattle off from memory the encyclopedia titles of their child-hood encyclopedia set, so that isn't completely ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On points (2), (5) and (6) - the humans had no choice in the placement of the wormhole - there could very well be a good reason for its placement - or the placement of the types of planets.   In fact, if you understand the narrative, the future humans need to lead Cooper over to a black hole in order to communicate the info to the daughter.  In (6), it's clear that the astronauts think these planets might be more habitable than Mars - it's only after they get there that they realize that doesn't work.  In (7) is it not possible to partially crack a helmet and still remain air-tight?  Is (8) even serious?  Can you not imagine messing up an environent to the point where it is better to leave than to stay behind?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we're left with (4), the problem of driving a truck fast with a flat tire.  Not exactly a terrible science problem, as I see it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue I have is that these are communicated (usally over twitter) as if they are clever, slam-dunk, obvious issues when a cursory glance at them shows otherwise.  This is an &lt;em&gt;educational&lt;/em&gt; criticism, and I expect better of science educators.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Answering Unanswerable Questions</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/answering-unanswerable-questions.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-09-11T00:00:00-04:00</published><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2015-09-11:answering-unanswerable-questions.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of questions designed specifically to not have answers or statements designed to be imponderable. Some of them actually do have answers, it seems, when you peel away what the question or statement actually says versus what is implied.  Over the years, I've found alternate ways of looking at three of these - one came to me this week - so I thought I'd share these pearls of wisdom.  Sometimes all it takes is to reframe the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="example-1-which-came-first-the-chicken-or-the-egg"&gt;Example 1: Which came first, the chicken or the egg?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an age-old question, designed to be imponderable - if the chicken is first, then didn't it hatch out of an egg?  If the egg came first, what animal laid that egg?  The answer to the question can be seen by reframing the question with a slight rewording:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which came first, the chicken or the &lt;em&gt;chicken&lt;/em&gt; egg?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That question might be imponderable, when the original one is not.  Dinosaurs, as one example, laid eggs and predated chickens by millions of years.  Thus, the egg came first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="example-2-that-is-six-of-one-half-a-dozen-of-another"&gt;Example 2: That is six of one, half-a-dozen of another.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This statement is clearly designed to mean something that doesn't make any difference - both alternatives are the same.  However, a little reframing shows that they are not the same.  Imagine I get my six or half dozen through a process of ordering food, especially at a bakery.  In that context I might get 13 (a baker's dozen) and thus a "half-a-dozen" might yield 6.5 rather than just 6.  It doesn't have to happen all the time for there still to be a difference - there is a small probability that half-a-dozen is a bit more than six.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="example-3-when-i-was-a-kid-i-walked-to-school-in-the-snow-up-hill-both-ways"&gt;Example 3: When I was a kid, I walked to school in the snow, up hill both ways.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My final example is a common phrase uttered by parents to humorously exaggerate the efforts they had to make as kids.  The imponderable, of course, is how can you walk to a place and back going up hill both ways.  We can see that this is indeed a possibility, if we reframe the statement a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I walked to school in the snow, up hill &lt;em&gt;the entire way&lt;/em&gt; both ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we can obviously see that the way to be able to go up hill both ways is if the trip involves a downhill and an uphill - you will be going up hill both ways, at &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, you may find some of these a little stretched, and making much ado about nothing, but I think the lesson here is larger.  Sometimes people try to frame a problem with an "obvious" interpretation to get you to think in a certain way.  However, with an eye for the difference between stated and implied, we can come to reasonable alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>The Giunta-Dillahunty debate</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/the-giunta-dillahunty-debate.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-08-23T00:00:00-04:00</published><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2015-08-23:the-giunta-dillahunty-debate.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was listening to the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_p5eQE-iM"&gt;Giunta-Dillahunty debate&lt;/a&gt;, "Does God Exist?", and the subsequent appearance of these two &lt;a href="http://www.spreaker.com/user/smalleyandhyso/191-matt-dillahunty-in-studio?utm_source=widget&amp;amp;utm_medium=widget"&gt;on the Dogma Debate show&lt;/a&gt; and felt there was enough there that required comment.  I've commented a bit &lt;a href="http://web.bryant.edu/~bblais/evidence-vs-argument.html"&gt;on the structure here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://web.bryant.edu/~bblais/deduction-induction-and-abduction-oh-my.html"&gt;on the terminology here&lt;/a&gt;, but took down a lot more notes listening to the debate again.  In this post, I refer to the debaters as Blake (Blake Giunta) and Matt (Matt Dillahunty) because it is a lot easier to type.  My notes are just my responses while listening to the debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="causation"&gt;Causation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Blake's debate he says that the Big Bang is plausibly our "first contingent event" and that "this is part of the standard cosmology" - however, he is wrong.  There are many cosmological models.  Some have the Big Bang as a recurrent event in an otherwise eternal universe.  Some have the Big Bang as a recurrent event in a non-eternal universe, but the original event is lost to direct observation.  Then there are multiverse models where the Big Bang is just one of many events.  Since there are many competing models, each of which is consistent with the current observations but differ in the Big Bang being the first contingient event, one cannot state that it is plausible that the Big Bang is the first contingient event.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing I noticed is that Blake talks a lot about "this causing that" and about "first causes" when referring to cosmology.  Sean Carroll in his &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/X0qKZqPy9T8?t=30m36s"&gt;excellent debate&lt;/a&gt; with William Lane Craig says that this sort of Aristotelean vocabulary was "cutting edge stuff 2500 years ago", but "today we know better".  The entire structure of the argument doesn't resemble anything a cosmologist would say, and I tend to trust the cosmologists on issues in cosmology.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why focus so much on causation? Something like the universe may be uncaused.  There are models of uncaused universes, and there are models of eternal universes - these are not a problem. Blake says that his argument "does not require that the universe has a cause. The argument only requires that a caused universe (contingent) is the kind of thing that could exist. It’s not a square-circle."  I don't think this adds anything useful, but I'd have to go into that more with Blake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even quantum field theory has the production of pairs of particles, apparently uncaused.  If you're going to say that these particles are caused in someway, then you need to put forward a model where are you demonstrate what the causation is.  The current understanding is either these effects are uncaused, or the notion of the causation vocabulary doesn't enter in.  So far I've never seen a causal a model put forward.  Blake states later, and is correct in saying, that model equations in physics are not &lt;em&gt;causally&lt;/em&gt; related to anything and that's exactly Sean Carroll's point - modern cosmology doesn't use the vocabulary of causation.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="philosophy-as-word-salad"&gt;Philosophy as Word Salad&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blake takes a lot of time talking about "contingent" and "necessary" things.  An argument he uses is the following, with &lt;a href="https://beliefmap.org/god-exists/necessary-being/"&gt;several alternate forms found on his website&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is possible that the first contingent thing is caused to exist. (Premise)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the possible case where the first contingent thing is caused to exist, a causally powerful necessary being must cause it to exist. (Premise)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A causally powerful necessary being possibly exists. (From 1 and 2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A possibly causally powerful necessary being necessarily exists. (From 3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He refers to S5, another &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S5_(modal_logic)"&gt;philosophical term I had to look up&lt;/a&gt;.  It is a modal logic system that implies the claim that "if something is possibly necessary, then it is necessary".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blake talks about the necessary entity who "can possibly cause things" and because this entity is &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt;, it can exist without space and time and that sounds "suspiciously like God".  Further, he talks about the "non-necessitating nature of the causation" and thus claims that the action of this entity "must be nondeterministic", concluding that "this is exactly the sort of thing we get with a free will choice."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blake says that the universe with all its 17 particles and all of the constants would be unlikely to be necessary itself (another version of the fine-tuning argument).  However, Blake fails to realize that the same argument could've been made for the spectra of stars in the 1800's.  The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_spectrum"&gt;spectra of stars&lt;/a&gt; are very specific, and complex.  It was known that the patterns in the complexity could be used to classify stars and even &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium#History"&gt;infer some of their contents&lt;/a&gt;.  It would have been very hard to believe that all of that complexity, and the specific patterns observed, would follow from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation"&gt;a single equation&lt;/a&gt; - but that is in fact what is true.  This is one of the reasons why these philosophical arguments for the existence of things is unconvincing to me - I simply do not trust human intuition when I hear the universe "must be" a certain way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aristotle made &lt;em&gt;philosophical&lt;/em&gt; arguments for the existence of the four elements, the motion of objects relative to their composition, and an Earth-centered universe.  We find these notions of Aristotle quaint now, not just because they were wrong (which they were) but because he never &lt;em&gt;tested&lt;/em&gt; his ideas.  That is a critical point here - you can make all the philosophical arguments you want for the existence of whatever you want but you need to close the loop and actually &lt;em&gt;test&lt;/em&gt; something.  It's not enough to show something is plausible (which I don't think Blake has even done) and that there are philosophical reasons for why you think it is there.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here is a challenge to Blake, and similar theists making these philosophical arguments.  Can you give me &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; prediction that the philosophical models actually make?   I'm not talking about something that they explain that we already know, but something we haven't seen yet that differentiates their model from other models.   We ask the same for the Big-Bang cosmologists, and the multiverse cosmologists, and the string theorists.  I have yet to see that even &lt;em&gt;attempted&lt;/em&gt; by the philosophers and that is why scientists just don't take them seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="probabilistic-thinking"&gt;Probabilistic thinking&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blake says that conceivability is a good guide to possibility - if you can conceive of something, then it is likely that something is at least possible.  His notion of "possible" he states is "metaphysical possibility" which, as a scientist, I read as "useless possibility".  Just show me whether there is evidence for something - I don't care to know if it is possible beforehand.  If you show evidence, then the notion of possibility is answered automatically.  If you don't, then who cares whether something is possible?  A unicorn is possible, but does anyone really care?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through purely philosophical arguments, Blake believes he has demonstrated that the prior probability of theism is high (which he of course hasn't).  Then he devotes his attention to the likelihood, and focuses on the moral arena.  The structure of the argument can be written mathematically like:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
P(\mbox{moral arena }|\,{\rm theism}) &amp;amp;\sim&amp;amp; [10\%,90\%] \\
P(\mbox{moral arena }|\,{\rm atheism}) &amp;amp;\sim&amp;amp; P({\rm universe}\,|\,{\rm atheism})\times P({\rm life}\,|\,{\rm atheism})\times \nonumber \\
&amp;amp;&amp;amp;P({\rm consciousness}\,|\,{\rm atheism}) \times P({\rm morality}\,|\,{\rm atheism})
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Then what happens is that, unless some of the terms in the atheist calculation are very large, the long product will give you something quite small.  There are many problems with this line of reasoning, as one can imagine. First, why isn't the calculation symmetric?  For example, shouldn't we really do:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
P(\mbox{moral arena}\,|\,{\rm theism}) &amp;amp;\sim&amp;amp; P({\rm universe}\,|\,{\rm theism})\times P({\rm life}\,|\,{\rm theism})\times \nonumber\\
&amp;amp;&amp;amp;P({\rm consciousness}\,|\,{\rm theism}) \times P({\rm morality}\,|\,{\rm theism}) \\
P(\mbox{moral arena}\,|\,{\rm atheism}) &amp;amp;\sim&amp;amp; P({\rm universe}\,|\,{\rm atheism})\times P({\rm life}\,|\,{\rm atheism})\times \nonumber\\
&amp;amp;&amp;amp;P({\rm consciousness}\,|\,{\rm atheism}) \times P({\rm morality}\,|\,{\rm atheism})
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let's take one term, but similar things can be done with all of them.  To demonstrate &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P({\rm universe}\,|\,{\rm atheism})\)&lt;/span&gt; is low, Blake brings up the fine-tuning argument and the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_brain"&gt;Boltzmann Brain&lt;/a&gt; problem.  Let's flip this around, and apply it to the theist part, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P({\rm universe}\,|\,{\rm theism})\)&lt;/span&gt;.  The universe we observe should be very unlikely on theism for at least three reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A perfect being is complete, and thus does not need to create anything.  In fact the creation of imperfection is less than perfect, and thus cannot contribute to the greatest possible good. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A perfect being need not create a finely-tuned universe, so the existence of a finely-tuned one out of all possible not-finely tuned universes is unlikely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A non-physical mind would actually &lt;em&gt;prefer&lt;/em&gt; Boltzmann brains over brains with the particular physical limitations ours have. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can construct such arguments quite easily, which leads to Sean Carroll's observation that theism is not well defined.  It also leads to my challenge above - give me an actual &lt;em&gt;prediction&lt;/em&gt; or I don't need to take the arguments seriously. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the atheist side of the calculation is a hidden God-of-the-gaps argument.  Blake only includes terms for which we have the &lt;em&gt;least&lt;/em&gt; understanding, and selectively omits all the things that used to be attributed to gods but no longer (e.g. weather and disease).  He is almost explicit about it, when he says that he references the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/309/5731/75.full.pdf"&gt;list of 25 top questions in science&lt;/a&gt;, and focuses only on those terms which would be different between the theist and atheist models.  This list is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What Is the Universe Made Of?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What Is the Biological Basis of Consciousness?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why Do Humans Have So Few Genes?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Can the Laws of Physics Be Unified?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How Much Can Human Life Span Be Extended?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What Controls Organ Regeneration?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How Can a Skin Cell Become a Nerve Cell?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How Does a Single Somatic Cell Become a Whole Plant?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How Does Earth’s Interior Work?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are We Alone in the Universe?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How and Where Did Life on Earth Arise?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What Determines Species Diversity?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What Genetic Changes Made Us Uniquely Human?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How Are Memories Stored and Retrieved?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How Did Cooperative Behavior Evolve?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How Will Big Pictures Emerge From a Sea of Biological Data?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How Far Can We Push Chemical Self-Assembly?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What Are the Limits of Conventional Computing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can We Selectively Shut Off Immune Responses?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do Deeper Principles Underlie Quantum Uncertainty and Nonlocality?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is an Effective HIV Vaccine Feasible?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How Hot Will the Greenhouse World Be?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What Can Replace Cheap Oil— and When?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will Malthus Continue to Be Wrong?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could easily come up with terms which might be more likely "on atheism", if I wanted to approach the problem like that.  Numbers 13, 14, and 15 would be pretty easy, I think.  Much of this calculation, beyond being God-of-the-Gaps, simply lacks imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that I notice about Blake is his confidence in things that are well outside of expertise.  For example, he confidently says things like "spontaneous combustion is just as common under multi-verse as anything else" or "there is a Boltzmann Brain problem in multiverse models".  It's clear that he does not know what he's talking about in these cases yet his level of confidence does not scale with that.  Again, reference the &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/X0qKZqPy9T8"&gt;Craig-Carroll debate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, on the moral issue, I would ask Blake what properties of the moral world  would &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be consistent with the God as Blake describes?   I'm pretty sure everything that he is arguing for is post-hoc and that there is a rationalization for nearly everything - making the definition of God so plastic as to lack simplicity (see a &lt;a href="http://web.bryant.edu/~bblais/deduction-induction-and-abduction-oh-my.html"&gt;previous post when I talk about the notion of simplicity&lt;/a&gt;).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-limits-of-science"&gt;The limits of science&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's another example of the kind of arrogance of the Blake's position when he says science cannot explain the fundamental laws of nature because it requires initial conditions, and those initial conditions cannot be given or justified by science itself.  I don't think this is a good argument.  For example, maybe the fundamental laws will be self-explanatory. We just don't know.  However, I'm certainly not about to go claiming that I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; what the form of those laws is going to take.  I certainly won't trust that my intuition will accurately track all the way back to the fundamental laws - they haven't been a great guide for the past 100 years in physics, why should I expect them to work in the next 100 years?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to demonstrate the limits of science, he asks about the difference between "methodological naturalism" and "methodological almost-naturalism", where science would be correct 99.999% of the time, except for the occasional supernatural intervention.  Is science limited to excluding the latter as a matter of principle?  I don't think so, or at least not entirely.  I've written about &lt;a href="http://web.bryant.edu/~bblais/testing-the-supernatural.html"&gt;science testing the supernatural&lt;/a&gt; elsewhere, and in summary I state&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;science cannot test supernatural &lt;em&gt;explanations&lt;/em&gt;, because they are not defined. They can test specific predictions that incorporate unknown, and possibly unknowable, entities that have direct physical effects. In most cases of religious claims including supernatural effects there are no predictions made, and thus the term is empty and useless - an excuse for the intellectually lazy. Where specific predictions have been made (e.g. efficacy of prayer, existence of specific miracles, etc...) the predictions have not been supported. In this way, science can test God...and God has failed the test. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, again, I say to Blake - show me a &lt;em&gt;prediction&lt;/em&gt; that almost-naturalism gives you, and then we can test it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blake says that fundamental particles cannot have deeper mechanisms, that there is no mechanism for, say, the electron and the charge pulling or pushing on another charge.  That's just flat-out wrong.   There is a mechanism, part of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics"&gt;QED&lt;/a&gt;, either with fields or the exchange of virtual photons.  There may be a somewhat separate explanation in string theory.  The problem isn't that he is wrong, but that Blake is showing his trust in philosophical arguments to try to tell us what forms physical theories &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; have and it just comes off wrong because he is not proposing a &lt;em&gt;model&lt;/em&gt;,  he's not making any &lt;em&gt;predictions&lt;/em&gt;, and in my book that means he's not even in the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blake says that you can't have an infinite regress in mechanisms but I don't see how he could say that.  Some infinite series actually converge.  In the best theory that we know of, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics"&gt;QED&lt;/a&gt;, we have Feynman diagrams including infinite number of finite interactions, but the collection gives a meaningful result.  Just like the origin of the universe, I do not presume to think that my intuition will hold well for infinite things.  For example, you would think the series &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(1+2+3+4+5+\cdots\)&lt;/span&gt; would not have a finite value...&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_%2B_2_%2B_3_%2B_4_%2B_%E2%8B%AF"&gt;but it does&lt;/a&gt;...and it's negative!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="some-theology"&gt;Some theology&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the topic of divine hiddenness, Blake says something like "you have to demonstrate that God doesn't have morally sufficient reasons to stay hidden" and I think that's really a dodge, especially given that there is basically no moral act one can think of that God couldn't do - just read the Bible for some whoppers.  Another idea he proposes is that maybe you're in a position right now where you would just reject him if he showed up, or maybe more people would be saved if he doesn't show himself.  Of course, as Matt pointed out, God didn't seem to have a problem with showing himself in the Bible stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Blake talked about these different "theories" (using "theories" in the colloquial sense, of a hunch or idea), and when he did the same thing with different notions of Hell, the first thing I thought of was "how could you possibly confirm these?"  He makes no attempt to do so, as far as I can tell. One thing that surprised me when I was first working with biologists was the length to which the biologists would try to eliminate alternative hypotheses and to verify &lt;em&gt;directly&lt;/em&gt; any extra elements that they were positing.  If they said that some effect could be this gene expressed, then they would have to go and verify that that the particular gene not only did that function but did it in the specific case that they were looking at etc...  I don't see the same thing &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; happening with these theological arguments.  No attempt is ever made to directly confirm the hunches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt states, correctly, that we always explain things in terms of other things that we understand and that "explaining" things in terms of things that we &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; understand isn't an explanation.  Robert Price puts it like "explaining X by double-X".  Therefore, the God &lt;em&gt;explanation&lt;/em&gt; isn't really an explanation.  I would add that, because there are no &lt;em&gt;predictions&lt;/em&gt; made, it is an unuseful idea anyway, whether you choose to call it an explanation or not.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blake says that he believes in interventionist God, so I would ask him for his evidence for the interventions, and further, for his evidence that those interventions are caused by God.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="on-predictionsagain"&gt;On predictions...again&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the origin of life, I would love to hear what predictions the Blake would make given his God model for starting life and what  the researchers should look for?  What should be the next test, with various proposals like RNA world or early biotic chemistry or replicating chemistry?  There are predictions that these ideas make, even when they incomplete, so tell me what should we do with theistic models?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make the comparison more explicit, let's look at two examples from physics: the Higgs boson and string theory.  In the case of the Higgs boson, it was proposed 50 years ago to complete a theory that already explained every known experiment to the accuracy of every known measurement.  The Higgs took 50 years of very hard work to confirm, and although most scientists were confident that we'd observe it (that confidence came from the other predictions of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics"&gt;QED&lt;/a&gt;), the direct confirmation was necessary to rationally accept the model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of string theory, scientists are not confident, even though there are no experiments currently which contradict it.  The problem is that there are also no unique predictions from string theory which can distinguish it from others.  Lacking those predictions completely undermines the confidence one has in the theory.  Think about this: string theory is consistent at the equation level with our best understanding of gravity and quantum mechanics (which is way better than any theist model), and it &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; doesn't convince scientists due to the fact that it makes no predictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in summary, I am not convinced &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt; that philosophical arguments - by themselves - can give us &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; knowledge of the external world.  The only methods that work involve prediction, and are the methods of science.  When I say science, I generally mean the rational enterprise, combined with the empirical foundation of observational science (this includes history and possibly economics, for example).  As far as I can tell Blake doesn't offer any real evidence for the existence of the interventionist God, nor does he make any predictions from his theistic model.  Essentially, as far as I can tell, his arguments have the same content as "magic did it".&lt;/p&gt;

It has its uses, but can easily devolve into a word game with no real substance.  &lt;a href="http://web.bryant.edu/~bblais/philosophy-and-science-whats-the-difference.html"&gt;My basic perspective&lt;/a&gt; is that philosophy is "science without data".  However, in my reading and listening to debates in religious thought I come across philosophers often, and have to parse their arguments.  An interesting collection of these arguments occurs in the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_p5eQE-iM"&gt;Giunta-Dillahunty debate&lt;/a&gt; and subsequent appearance of these two &lt;a href="http://www.spreaker.com/user/smalleyandhyso/191-matt-dillahunty-in-studio?utm_source=widget&amp;amp;utm_medium=widget"&gt;on the Dogma Debate show&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the Dogma Debate episode, the term "abduction" was bandied about comparing methods of inference, including deduction and induction.  I was not familiar with the term "abduction", and had to look it up.  After much reading, it seems that the term "abductive reasoning" is basically needless - there is only one method of inference, and these other terms are at best subsets.  First, we explore the philosopher's definitions of these terms, and then look at the proper way to describe them.  ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="definitions-of-terms"&gt;Definitions of Terms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm getting the material here from the &lt;a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/abduction/"&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy article on Abduction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="deduction"&gt;Deduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In deductive inferences, what is inferred is necessarily true if the premises from which it is inferred are true; that is, the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A familiar type of example is inferences instantiating the schema&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All As are Bs.
a is an A.
Hence, a is a B.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or, in other words&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All men are mortal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Socrates is a man&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, Socrates is mortal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id="induction"&gt;Induction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inductive inferences form a somewhat heterogeneous class, but for present purposes they may be characterized as those inferences that are based purely on statistical data, such as observed frequencies of occurrences of a particular feature in a given population. An example of such an inference would be this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;96 per cent of the Flemish college students speak both Dutch and French.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Louise is a Flemish college student.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hence, Louise speaks both Dutch and French.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the relevant statistical information may also be more vaguely given, as in the premise, “Most people living in Chelsea are rich.” (There is much discussion about whether the conclusion of an inductive argument can be stated in purely qualitative terms or whether it should be a quantitative one — for instance, that it holds with a probability of .96 that Louise speaks both Dutch and French — or whether it can sometimes be stated in qualitative terms — for instance, if the probability that it is true is high enough — and sometimes not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mere fact that an inference is based on statistical data is not enough to classify it as an inductive one. You may have observed many gray elephants and no non-gray ones, and infer from this that all elephants are gray, because &lt;em&gt;that would provide the best explanation for why you have observed so many gray elephants and no non-gray ones&lt;/em&gt;. This would be an instance of an abductive inference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That gets us to the final term, abduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="abduction"&gt;Abduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abduction or, as it is also often called, Inference to the Best Explanation is a type of inference that assigns special status to explanatory considerations. Most philosophers agree that this type of inference is frequently employed, in some form or other, both in everyday and in scientific reasoning. 
[....]
It suggests that the best way to distinguish between induction and abduction is this: both are ampliative, meaning that the conclusion goes beyond what is (logically) contained in the premises (which is why they are non-necessary inferences), but in abduction there is an implicit or explicit appeal to explanatory considerations, whereas in induction there is not; in induction, there is only an appeal to observed frequencies or statistics. (I emphasize “only,” because in abduction there may also be an appeal to frequencies or statistics, as the example about the elephants exhibits.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="a-couple-of-examples-of-abductive-reasoning"&gt;A couple of examples of abductive reasoning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You happen to know that Tim and Harry have recently had a terrible row that ended their friendship. Now someone tells you that she just saw Tim and Harry jogging together. The best explanation for this that you can think of is that they made up. You conclude that they are friends again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and another&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One morning you enter the kitchen to find a plate and cup on the table, with breadcrumbs and a pat of butter on it, and surrounded by a jar of jam, a pack of sugar, and an empty carton of milk. You conclude that one of your house-mates got up at night to make him- or herself a midnight snack and was too tired to clear the table. This, you think, best explains the scene you are facing. To be sure, it might be that someone burgled the house and took the time to have a bite while on the job, or a house-mate might have arranged the things on the table without having a midnight snack but just to make you believe that someone had a midnight snack. But these hypotheses strike you as providing much more contrived explanations of the data than the one you infer to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these examples, the conclusions do not follow logically from the premises. For instance, it does not follow logically that Tim and Harry are friends again from the premises that they had a terrible row which ended their friendship and that they have just been seen jogging together; it does not even follow, we may suppose, from all the information you have about Tim and Harry. Nor do you have any useful statistical data about friendships, terrible rows, and joggers that might warrant an inference from the information that you have about Tim and Harry to the conclusion that they are friends again, or even to the conclusion that, probably (or with a certain probability), they are friends again. What leads you to the conclusion, and what according to a considerable number of philosophers may also warrant this conclusion, is precisely the fact that Tim and Harry's being friends again would, if true, best explain the fact that they have just been seen jogging together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="explanatory-virtues"&gt;Explanatory Virtues&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article continues,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In textbooks on epistemology or the philosophy of science, one often encounters something like the following as a formulation of abduction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABD1  Given evidence &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(E\)&lt;/span&gt; and candidate explanations &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(H_1\)&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\ldots\)&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(H_n\)&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(E\)&lt;/span&gt;, infer the truth of that &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(H_i\)&lt;/span&gt; which best explains &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(E\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An observation that is frequently made about this rule, and that points to a potential problem for it, is that it presupposes the notions of candidate explanation and best explanation, neither of which has a straightforward interpretation. While some still hope that the former can be spelled out in purely logical, or at least purely formal, terms, it is often said that the latter must appeal to the so-called theoretical virtues, like simplicity, generality, and coherence with well-established theories; the best explanation would then be the hypothesis which, on balance, does best with respect to these virtues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article doesn't define these "virtues", and googling around isn't much clearer.  A list from Richard Carrier's book Proving History is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plausibility - "conform to the expectations set by our background knowledge"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ad Hocness or Simplicity - "it must include fewer new suppositions"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explanatory power - "it must make the observation statements it implies more probable than any other."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explanatory fitness - "must not contradict any evidence or well-established beliefs"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explanatory scope - "it must imply a greater variety of observation statements"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id="where-does-this-all-fit-together"&gt;Where does this all fit together?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E. T. Jaynes, in his great &lt;a href="http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/prob/book.pdf"&gt;book on probability&lt;/a&gt;, starts with this example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose some dark night a policeman walks down a street, apparently deserted; but suddenly he
hears a burglar alarm, looks across the street, and sees a jewelry store with a broken window. Then
a gentleman wearing a mask comes crawling out through the broken window, carrying a bag which
turns out to be full of expensive jewelry. The policeman doesn't hesitate at all in deciding that this
gentleman is dishonest. But by what reasoning process does he arrive at this conclusion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A moment's thought makes it clear that our policeman's conclusion was not a logical deduction
from the evidence; for there may have been a perfectly innocent explanation for everything. It
might be, for example, that this gentleman was the owner of the jewelry store and he was coming
home from a masquerade party, and didn’t have the key with him. But just as he walked by
his store a passing truck threw a stone through the window; and he was only protecting his own
property.
Now while the policeman's reasoning process was not logical deduction, we will grant that it
had a certain degree of validity. The evidence did not make the gentleman's dishonesty certain,
but it did make it extremely plausible. This is an example of a kind of reasoning in which we have
all become more or less proficient, necessarily, long before studying mathematical theories. We are
hardly able to get through one waking hour without facing some situation (e.g. will it rain or won't
it?) where we do not have enough information to permit deductive reasoning; but still we must
decide immediately what to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sounds a lot like the scenarios outlined in the &lt;a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/abduction/"&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy article on Abduction&lt;/a&gt;, yet the word &lt;em&gt;abduction&lt;/em&gt; is not found in any of the pages of Jaynes.  &lt;em&gt;Deduction&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;induction&lt;/em&gt; are both mentioned, yet &lt;em&gt;abduction&lt;/em&gt; is not - why?  It's because &lt;em&gt;abduction&lt;/em&gt; is just a special case of &lt;em&gt;induction&lt;/em&gt;, and a not a very interesting one at that.  &lt;em&gt;Deduction&lt;/em&gt; is also a special case of &lt;em&gt;induction&lt;/em&gt;, but is worthy of the distinction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="induction-vs-deduction"&gt;Induction vs Deduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process of &lt;em&gt;induction&lt;/em&gt;, or inference in general, is simply the application of the rules of probability.  These are derived from a set of axioms, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Degrees of Plausibility are represented by real numbers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Qualitative Correspondence with common sense. (aka consistency with &lt;em&gt;deductive&lt;/em&gt; logic)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consistency&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a conclusion can be reasoned out in more than one way, then
every possible way must lead to the same result.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One always takes into account all of the evidence it has
relevant to a question. One does not arbitrarily ignore some of
the information, basing its conclusions only on what remains.
In other words, one should be completely non-ideological&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One always represents equivalent states of knowledge by
equivalent plausibility assignments. That is, if in two problems
one's state of knowledge is the same (except perhaps for
the labeling of the propositions), then one must assign the same
plausibilities in both.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deduction&lt;/em&gt; is simply this process applied exclusively to true/false propositions - essentially degrees of plausibility of 0 or 1.  In this way, the total certainty of mathematical and philosophical proofs are a subset of the general inductive framework known as probability theory.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-rules-of-probability"&gt;The Rules of Probability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mathematically, the axioms above lead directly to a few simple quantitative rules.  A very nice derivation is in Tom Loredo's article &lt;a href="http://bayes.wustl.edu/gregory/articles.pdf"&gt;From Laplace to Supernova SN 1987A: Bayesian Inference in Astrophysics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Definition Rule&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(A)\)&lt;/span&gt; is a number between 0 and 1, representing the strength of belief in a statement, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(A\)&lt;/span&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Negation Rule
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
P(A) + P({\rm\bf not}\, A) = 1
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sum Rule &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
P(A \,{\rm\bf or}\, B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \,{\rm\bf and}\, B)
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Conjunction Rule&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
P(A \,{\rm\bf and}\, B) = P(B|A)P(A)
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bayes Rule (derived from the Conjunction Rule)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are then applied to all cases.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="abduction-mapped-to-probability"&gt;Abduction mapped to Probability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic idea of abduction is to find the "best explanation" given the data we have.  This reads like the following,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{eqnarray*}
P(\mbox{explanation 1}|\mbox{data})\\
P(\mbox{explanation 2}|\mbox{data})\\
P(\mbox{explanation 3}|\mbox{data})\\
\vdots
\end{eqnarray*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
or with shorter notation
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{eqnarray*}
P(E_1|\mbox{data})\\
P(E_2|\mbox{data})\\
P(E_3|\mbox{data})\\
\vdots
\end{eqnarray*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we find the one with the largest probability.  Setting one of these terms up with Bayes Rule, we can see where the explanatory virtues come in.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{eqnarray*}
P(\mbox{explanation 1}|\mbox{data})=\frac{P(\mbox{data}|\mbox{explanation 1})\times P(\mbox{explanation 1})}{P(\mbox{data})}
\end{eqnarray*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
where the denominator includes terms for all other explanations, again written with shorter notation for convenience&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{eqnarray*}
P(E_1|\mbox{data})=\frac{P(\mbox{data}|E_1)\times P(E_1)}{P(\mbox{data}|E_1)\times P(E_1) + P(\mbox{data}|E_2)\times P(E_2)+\cdots}
\end{eqnarray*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For any of the explanations, we have the following&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plausibility - "conform to the expectations set by our background knowledge" - high prior probability, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(\mbox{explanation 1})\)&lt;/span&gt; in the numerator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ad Hocness or Simplicity - "it must include fewer new suppositions" (see below on simplicity)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explanatory power - "it must make the observation statements it implies more probable than any other." - high likelihood, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(\mbox{data}|\mbox{explanation 1})\)&lt;/span&gt; especially compared to others.  This appears both in the numerator and denominator of Bayes Rule.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explanatory fitness - "must not contradict any evidence or well-established beliefs" - must not have a low likelihood, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(\mbox{data}|\mbox{explanation 1})\)&lt;/span&gt;, in the numerator (and one term in the denominator).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explanatory scope - "it must imply a greater variety of observation statements" - again, high likelihood in the numerator (and one term in the denominator), &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(\mbox{data}|\mbox{explanation 1})\)&lt;/span&gt; - it is higher for more data explained with the same idea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id="what-is-up-with-simplicity"&gt;What is up with simplicity?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the concept in the process of inference which is most often mistaken, especially with apologetic arguments, is the notion of &lt;em&gt;simplicity&lt;/em&gt;.  In the debate, Blake Giunta argues that God has very &lt;em&gt;few&lt;/em&gt; properties, and is thus &lt;em&gt;simple&lt;/em&gt;.  Simple typically means higher prior probability.  However, it isn't the number of components that is important, but their flexibility.  One can explain anything by saying "magic did it" using only one component (magic).  This is simple in the sense of number of components, but not simple in the probabilistic sense.  Why is that?  It's because "magic" has a high flexibility.  For a process, this can take the form of different &lt;em&gt;mechanisms&lt;/em&gt;.  For a parameter, it can take the form of different numerical &lt;em&gt;values&lt;/em&gt;.  In Loredo's article, it 
is phrased as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crudely speaking a complicated model can explain anything;
thus, its prior predictive probability for any particular outcome is small, because the predictive probability is spread out more or less evenly among the many possible outcomes. But a simpler model is more constrained and limited in its ability to explain or fit data. As a result, its predictive distribution is concentrated on a subset of the possible outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Bayesian probability analysis, there is an automatic penalty for models with larger parameter ranges compared to models with narrow ranges (see &lt;a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~mackay/itprnn/ps/345.357.pdf"&gt;Mackay here&lt;/a&gt; for one treatment).  Blake Giunta's "simple" definition of God is anything but - it is so ill-specified as to be consistent with nearly any result in the world.  The "fewer new suppositions" definition of Ad Hocness may work, but it doesn't work for the virtue of Simplicity. Bayesian probability analysis captures both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="final-thoughts"&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell, the term abduction is an unnecessary term.  It seems to me to be just a renaming of induction and doesn't add anything useful to it.  The explanatory virtues are themselves somewhat ad hoc and not properly specified, and where they are they are a trivial consequence of the well-specified process of induction.  I had never heard of abduction, except in the realm of Christian apologetics, which makes me wonder what purpose it serves there that properly doing induction doesn't.  Perhaps it lets one distance oneself from the extremely low prior probability of the claims made, and focus on fancy sounding terms like "explanatory power" and "ad hocness".&lt;/p&gt;

Blake Giunta seems to be confident that &lt;em&gt;philosophical&lt;/em&gt; arguments can be used as evidence for the existence of God when scientific procedures fail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although much of the discussion involves what counts as evidence, the notion of probability and knowledge, and the role of the supernatural in inference, there is a more basic question that is never brought up.  I would love to hear even one case of the existence of an entity that was ever best described only in &lt;em&gt;philosophical&lt;/em&gt; terms, or an entity whose existence we could at some point be confident in through &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; a philosophical argument.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that if you are asked for your best evidence for the existence of something, and you present only a &lt;em&gt;philosophical&lt;/em&gt; argument, then you are &lt;a href="http://web.bryant.edu/~bblais/philosophy-and-science-whats-the-difference.html"&gt;conceding that you have no data&lt;/a&gt;.  If someone asked for the best evidence for Neptune, you'd show the &lt;a href="http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/imagesvideo/neptune.html"&gt;Voyager pictures&lt;/a&gt; and the pictures from telescopes.  If it were 100 years ago, you'd show telescopic traces in the sky.  If it were 200 years ago, one might be able to give a &lt;em&gt;philosophical&lt;/em&gt; argument about the simplicity of 8 planets instead of 6, or the &lt;em&gt;possibility&lt;/em&gt; of large gas giants other than Jupiter and Saturn, but one would never be justified in a strong belief in such an entity with such arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blake Giunta also commented that "before you can give evidence for what God did in the world you first have to demonstrate possibility [of his existence]."  He does this with the philosophical arguments, but again this is misguided.  If someone asks for your evidence for the existence of something, and you give a &lt;em&gt;philosophical&lt;/em&gt; argument for its possibility you are conceding defeat.  Why not present the evidence of the existence?  That itself will answer the possibility question - if I present pictures of Neptune from the Voyager mission, the question of the possibility of Neptune's existence becomes moot.   &lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Pluto, Pluto, Here We Come</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/pluto-pluto-here-we-come.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-07-03T00:00:00-04:00</published><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2015-07-03:pluto-pluto-here-we-come.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="images/Pluto-System-June-29.png" width=400px&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In anticipation of the &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/newhorizons/main/index.html"&gt;New Horizons&lt;/a&gt; close &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxwWpaGoJs"&gt;flyby of Pluto&lt;/a&gt; in a little over a week on July 14, 2015, I read with interest the article "&lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/07/calculating-plutos-mass-snapshots-new-horizons/"&gt;Calculating Pluto’s Mass With Snapshots From New Horizons&lt;/a&gt;".  This is totally something I would do with my students, although I would have done it a little differently.  Both my approach and theirs are perfectly fine, and come to equivalent answers.  The difference is in which concepts are stressed.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="assumptions-and-data"&gt;Assumptions and Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using their numbers for the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{eqnarray*}
\mbox{Period of Orbit}&amp;amp;=&amp;amp;3.2 \mbox{days} \\
\mbox{Distance between Pluto and Charon}&amp;amp;=&amp;amp;r=1.957\times 10^{4} \mbox{km}
\end{eqnarray*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I, like the authors of the article, would prefer to calculate this distance using angular distances of the image but I'll use the short-cut they used in the article for expediency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="keplers-law"&gt;Kepler's Law&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first deviation uses &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler's_laws_of_planetary_motion#Third_law"&gt;Kepler's Law&lt;/a&gt;, or rather, &lt;a href="http://astro.physics.uiowa.edu/ITU/glossary/keplers-third-law/"&gt;Newton's version of Kepler's Law&lt;/a&gt;.  The simplest &lt;em&gt;looking&lt;/em&gt; version of this equation uses units of AU for the distances, Solar Masses for the total mass of the orbiting bodies, and years for the period.  In this form, Kepler's Law looks like:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$
T^2 [\mbox{years}] = \frac{r^3 [\mbox{AU}]}{M_{\rm total}[\mbox{solar masses}]}
$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This law basically says that more massive systems, or more tightly bound systems, orbit faster.  In this case the units are a little inconvenient.  Newton's form uses meters, seconds, and kilograms - which also can involve a number of conversions, making it easier to lose track of the concepts.  I prefer an intermediate form, with a conversion factor out front to take care of units.  This form looks like:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$
T^2 [\mbox{days}] = \frac{r^3 [\mbox{km}]}{M_{\rm total}[\mbox{kg}]} \times 7.9\times 10^{10}
$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
From this, and the data above, we can arrive at the total mass of the Pluto-Charon system directly as:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{eqnarray*}
M_{\rm total}[\mbox{kg}] &amp;amp;=&amp;amp;\frac{r^3 [\mbox{km}]}{T^2 [\mbox{days}]}\times 7.9\times 10^{10}\\
&amp;amp;=&amp;amp;\frac{\left(1.957\times 10^{4}\right)^3 [\mbox{km}]}{3.2^2 [\mbox{days}]}\times 7.9\times 10^{10}=1.44\times 10^{22} {\rm kg}
\end{eqnarray*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice this number is a bit higher than the mass of Pluto, coming in at &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(1.3\times 10^{22} {\rm kg}\)&lt;/span&gt;.  That's because the mass calculated here is the total mass of the Pluto-Charon system, so it is &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(M_{\rm total} = M_{\rm Pluto}+M_{\rm Charon}=1.44\times 10^{22} {\rm kg}\)&lt;/span&gt;.  To get the masses separately, we bring in the concept of the center of mass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="center-of-mass"&gt;Center of Mass&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the video in the &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/07/calculating-plutos-mass-snapshots-new-horizons/"&gt;original article&lt;/a&gt;, you can see that Charon orbits about a little "x" in the middle in a big circle, and Pluto orbits about that same "x" in a smaller circle .  That "x" marks the point in space of the &lt;em&gt;center of mass&lt;/em&gt; of the two.  It's like two ice skaters holding on to each other as that spin in a circle - each one going in a circle.  If the two are the same size, then the center of their spinning is right in the middle of the two.  If one of the skaters is more massive, then the lighter person spins in a larger circle and the heavier person is pulled only slightly and spins in a smaller circle.  The relationship that they exhibit, mathematically, is
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$
m_1 r_1 = m_2 r_2
$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
or the product of their masses and the sizes of the circles is the same for both - the more massive object orbits in a smaller circle.  For Pluto and Charon, we can draw these circles from the images taken from the frames of the movies - I used Keynote, but you can use any drawing program.  Even by eye you can see that the size of Pluto's circle is about 1/8 that of Charon's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, from the center of mass, we have&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{eqnarray*}
M_{\rm Pluto} r_{\rm Pluto} &amp;amp;=&amp;amp; M_{\rm Charon} r_{\rm Charon}
\end{eqnarray*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
or, rearranging and measuring off of the image,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{M_{\rm Charon}}{M_{\rm Pluto}}&amp;amp;=&amp;amp;\frac{r_{\rm Pluto}}{r_{\rm Charon}} \\
&amp;amp;=&amp;amp;\frac{1}{8}
\end{eqnarray*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="putting-it-together"&gt;Putting it together&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we finally have, from Kepler's law, 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$ 
M_{\rm Pluto}+M_{\rm Charon}=1.44\times 10^{22} {\rm km}
$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
and from center of mass,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{M_{\rm Charon}}{M_{\rm Pluto}}&amp;amp;=&amp;amp;\frac{1}{8}
\end{eqnarray*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This leads to 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{eqnarray*}
M_{\rm Pluto}+\frac{1}{8}M_{\rm Pluto}&amp;amp;=&amp;amp;1.44\times 10^{22} {\rm kg}
\end{eqnarray*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
or
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{eqnarray*}
M_{\rm Pluto}&amp;amp;=&amp;amp;1.28\times 10^{22} {\rm kg}
\end{eqnarray*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
very close to the "right" answer.  Of course, the "right" answer was obtained in exactly the same way, just being more careful.  In fact, this is how we know nearly &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the masses of astronomical entities, from planets to stars to galaxies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="http://web.bryant.edu/~bblais/how-to-deflate-a-football-deflating-story.html"&gt;another post&lt;/a&gt;, I outlined how the drop in pressure was entirely consistent with what was measured with the laws of physics.  That post was done when the only data was the drop in pressure - nothing specific about the methods, or the data.  Then the 243 page &lt;a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/2073728/ted-wells-report-deflategate.pdf"&gt;Wells report&lt;/a&gt; came out with the methods and the data, as well as a sophisticated statistical report (see the Appendix A, page 229).  Once I saw (one page 231 (A-2)) that the pre-game pressures were "Assumed Pressure at Start of Game", I realized that there was nothing that the report could say.  The fact that there weren't &lt;em&gt;measurements&lt;/em&gt; taken at the beginning of the game invalidates nearly any analysis.  I was going to leave it at that, and possibly explore the problem as an introductory statistics problem, but basically dropped it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I was forwarded &lt;a href="https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/On-the-Wells-report.pdf"&gt;this critical analysis&lt;/a&gt; of the Wells report by the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) and my interest piqued again.  There is a nice &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/14/opinion/deflating-deflategate.html?_r=1"&gt;New York times piece&lt;/a&gt; to go along with the &lt;a href="https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/On-the-Wells-report.pdf"&gt;detailed report&lt;/a&gt;.  Suddenly it became clear that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the methods used in the Wells report were unorthodox, and basically incorrect&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is another alternative explanation for their finding that the Colt's footballs were significantly more inflated than the Patriot's footballs - physics again!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the Wells report plots, the &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(1/e\)&lt;/span&gt; time constant of a football going from one equilibrium pressure to another with a change in temperature comparable to that observed on the day is about 10 minutes.  What I hadn't realized in my initial analysis was that the &lt;em&gt;Patriots' footballs were measured first&lt;/em&gt; during the half-time, and the Colts footballs measured afterward - right at the end of half-time.  This is a delay of about 10 minutes.  This leads to the following two consequences:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Patriots' footballs are measured when they are the lowest pressure, or near lowest pressures, right after coming in from the cold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Colts' footballs are measured when they have had an ample chance to warm up by the end of half-time.  A delay of 10 minutes would bring the pressure up to about 66% of the distance from the cold temperature equilibrium pressure to the high temperature equilibrium pressure given the measured &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(1/e\)&lt;/span&gt; time constant of the football.  It would be closer to 75% if the delay is nearly a full 15-minute half-time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don't even need to throw in some confusion about which gauge was used a the beginning of the game vs the middle of the game (with a difference of 0.4 psi!).  You easily have a situation where, plausibly, all footballs could have been in regulation at the beginning of the game yet end up with one set higher pressure on average than the other in the middle of the game - even with no foul play. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frankly, I've found this so-called sophisticated quantitative analysis a great example of a smoke screen for alternative motivations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I want to add that although I am not convinced that the Patriots cheated, I am also not convinced that they didn't.  However, the burden of proof (as in the court of law) lies squarely with the prosecution, not the defense - and they have clearly not made their case.&lt;/p&gt;

Matt Dillahunty clearly defines atheism as a lack of belief, and in a court-room analogy says that he finds God "not guilty of existing".  In court, you find the plaintiff "guilty" or "not guilty", not "guilty" or "innocent".  The burden of proof lies squarely with the prosecution.  If they haven't met that burden, then the jury finds the plaintiff "not guilty".  They may, or may not, believe that the plaintiff is innocent.  Establishing &lt;em&gt;innocence&lt;/em&gt; in the crime changes the burden of proof to the defendant.  The difference here comes down to priors, which we can see through some illustrative examples mapped to probability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="odd-and-even-stars"&gt;Odd and Even Stars&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are there an odd number of stars in the universe or an even number?  Clearly, at any single point in time, there is a correct answer this question.  Given our lack of knowledge, we should have&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$
P(O)=P(E)=\frac{1}{2}
$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If someone were to claim that there was very likely an odd number of stars, we'd ask for evidence.  If that evidence is not persuasive,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$
P(O|{\rm evidence}) \sim P(O)
$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 then we would certainly &lt;em&gt;lack&lt;/em&gt; a belief in the odd-ness of the number of stars yet we would not say that we "believe there is not an odd number of stars".  It is up to the odd-number supporter to provide the evidence to raise our prior probability significantly above &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(O)=0.5\)&lt;/span&gt; - they have the burden of proof.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="different-data"&gt;Different Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we imagine data that might actually affect this prior probability, the situation is a bit different.  Let's imagine that through the laws of physics we could demonstrate that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stars are nearly always formed in pairs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;single stars are very short-lived&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we may actually have an argument for an even-number of stars in the universe.  In this case, we have
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$
P(O|{\rm data}) \ll P(O)
$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
and thus
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$
P(E|{\rm data}) \gg P(E)
$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where one belief goes down, the other goes up.  For our belief in odd-ness to go down our belief in evenness must go up.  We no longer simply &lt;em&gt;lack&lt;/em&gt; a belief in odd-ness, we now both &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt; in even-ness and &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt; in non-odd-ness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="more-than-two-outcomes"&gt;More than two outcomes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something interesting happens when there are more than two outcomes.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$
P(H)=P(R)=P(Y)=\frac{1}{3}
$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some data that nearly rules out one hypothesis, say &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(R\)&lt;/span&gt;, may not speak to either other hypothesis directly, so you get the equal redistribution like:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
\nonumber P(R)&amp;amp;\sim&amp;amp; 0 \\
\nonumber P(H)=P(Y)&amp;amp;\sim&amp;amp; 1/2 
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or it might be the case that the data leaves unchanged the prior probability of one of the hypotheses, raising the probability of the other, like
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
\nonumber P(R)&amp;amp;\sim&amp;amp; 0 \\
\nonumber P(H)&amp;amp;\sim&amp;amp; 1/3 \\
\nonumber P(Y)&amp;amp;\sim&amp;amp; 2/3 
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that it is possible to reduce the probability of one hypothesis (i.e. &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(R\)&lt;/span&gt;) and not effect the probability of a separate hypothesis (i.e. &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(H\)&lt;/span&gt;), when there are more than two outcomes.  It is also possible for the probability of that separate hypothesis (i.e. &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(H\)&lt;/span&gt;) to go up, or even go down.  In other words, when there are more than one hypothesis, presenting evidence for (or against) one hypothesis does not always guarantee an adjustment in another hypothesis down (or up).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="back-to-court"&gt;Back to court&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in court, the jury is tasked to decide "guilty" or "not-guilty", rather than "guilty" or "innocent".  Why are these not the same?  Because the &lt;em&gt;claim&lt;/em&gt; is that the accused is "guilty" (like "oddness of stars"), so the evidence needs to be established for the claim.  A jury deciding "not-guilty" is saying that 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$
P({\rm guilty}|{\rm evidence}) \sim P({\rm guilty})
$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
and the evidence is not convincing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="back-to-god"&gt;Back to God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The atheist is just that person who is unconvinced by the evidence, 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$
P({\rm God}|{\rm evidence}) \sim P({\rm God})
$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
not the person who believes there is no God,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$
P({\rm God}|{\rm evidence}) \ll 0.5
$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atheists find God "not guilty" of existing&lt;/p&gt;

In this post, I hope to sketch the relevant parts of the encyclopedia article, and demonstrate how it does not establish any significant deficiency of Hume.  I use the same headings as the &lt;a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/miracles/"&gt;article on miracles&lt;/a&gt; to make it easier to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="concepts-and-definitions"&gt;Concepts and Definitions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article begins by discussing one of Hume's definitions of a miracle as "a violation of the laws of nature".  From what I can tell, their main critique is they don't like the connotations of the word "law", a perspective I share - it is a bit loose terminology, with too many alternate meanings to be the foundation of a well-defined argument.  Their revised definition is the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A miracle is an event that exceeds the productive power of nature&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this is the scientist in me, and why I am not a philosopher, but I don't see a striking difference between these two definitions in at least how they are used.  So it seems reasonable to adopt this as a good working definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They go on to clarify a subset of miracle,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a religiously significant miracle is a detectable miracle that has a supernatural cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This clarification is to deal with the following problem, and I'd agree with at least the sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An insignificant shift in a few grains of sand in the lonesome desert might, if it exceeded the productive powers of nature, qualify as a miracle in some thin sense, but it would manifestly lack religious significance and count not be used as the fulcrum for any interesting argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not sure how, in practice, one would be able to determine a "supernatural cause", let alone establish how an event could be beyond the "productive power of nature" without committing a fallacy of &lt;em&gt;argument from ignorance&lt;/em&gt;, but let's leave that for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="arguments-for-miracle-claims"&gt;Arguments for Miracle Claims&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section starts with a quick list of the types of evidence and arguments made for miracles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many arguments for miracles adduce the testimony of sincere and able eyewitnesses as the key piece of evidence on which the force of the argument depends. But other factors are also cited in favor of miracle claims: the existence of commemorative ceremonies from earliest times, for example, or the transformation of the eyewitnesses from fearful cowards into defiant proclaimers of the resurrection, or the conversion of St. Paul, or the growth of the early church under extremely adverse conditions and without any of the normal conditions of success such as wealth, patronage, or the use of force. These considerations are often used jointly in a cumulative argument. It is therefore difficult to isolate a single canonical argument for most miracle claims. The various arguments must be handled on a case-by-case basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these pieces of so-called evidence are the worst kind of evidence, for which there are countless examples of the same, or similar evidence use to shore up the claims of other (presumably false) beliefs.  You can think "Mormonism" or "Alien Abductions" for nearly every point listed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They then outline two types of inductive arguments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the conclusion (in this case that the miracle in question has actually occurred) is probable to some specific degree, or at least more probable than not&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the conclusion is more probable given the evidence presented than it is considered independently of that evidence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Point (1) is just either specifying either &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P({\rm miracle}|{\rm data})\)&lt;/span&gt; directly or establishing only that &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P({\rm miracle}|{\rm data})&amp;gt;0.5\)&lt;/span&gt;.  Point (2) is &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P({\rm miracle}|{\rm data})&amp;gt;P({\rm miracle})\)&lt;/span&gt;.  Point (2) is nearly useless.  For example, you could have
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{eqnarray*}
P({\rm miracle})&amp;amp;=&amp;amp;0.00001 \\
P({\rm miracle}|{\rm data})&amp;amp;=&amp;amp;0.001
\end{eqnarray*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
and still have a seriously unlikely hypothesis, even given a factor of 100 increase in probability of a miracle given the data.  Thus the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; thing that matters must be the actual value of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P({\rm miracle}|{\rm data})\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One such argument for miracles specifies the type of evidence needed to make one confident that one is talking about a miracle.  The article calls this a "criteriological" argument, but all of the arguments dealt with are probabilistic.  What are the criteria, for example?  This one is from Charles Leslie:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That the matters of fact be such, as that men's outward senses, their eyes and ears, may be judges of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That it be done publicly in the face of the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That not only public monuments be kept up in memory of it, but some outward actions to be performed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That such monuments, and such actions or observances, be instituted, and do commence from the time that the matter of fact was done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can easily site both the golden plates of Joseph Smith, and also the events surrounding Roswell, that satisfy all of these.  Clearly, there is an issue with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another common argument is called the "minimal facts" approach.  The best summary, and take-down of this argument is on &lt;a href="https://adversusapologetica.wordpress.com/2013/06/29/knocking-out-the-pillars-of-the-minimal-facts-apologetic/"&gt;Matthew Ferguson's blog&lt;/a&gt;.  One essential missing part of the minimal facts approach is that it only includes &lt;em&gt;likelihoods&lt;/em&gt; and not &lt;em&gt;priors&lt;/em&gt;, and thus fails a basic probabilistic analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="probabilistic-arguments"&gt;Probabilistic arguments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first form here deals with &lt;em&gt;testimony&lt;/em&gt;, with the following assumptions and conventions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(T_i\equiv\)&lt;/span&gt; the proposition "Witness &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(i\)&lt;/span&gt; testifies to &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(M\)&lt;/span&gt;"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(T_i,T_j) = P(T_i)\times P(T_j)\)&lt;/span&gt;: independence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(T_i|M)=P(T_j|M)\)&lt;/span&gt; for all &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(i\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(j\)&lt;/span&gt;: all testimony is equally informative&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then easily derive:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$
\frac{P(M|T_1,T_2,\cdots,T_n)}{P(\sim\!M|T_1,T_2,\cdots,T_n)} = \left(\frac{P(T_1|M)}{P(T_1|\sim\!M)}\right)^n \times \frac{P(M)}{P(\sim\!M)}
$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article then spins this in a positive way toward miracles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[I]f independent witnesses can be found, who speak truth more frequently than falsehood, &lt;em&gt;it is ALWAYS possible to assign a number of independent witnesses, the improbability of the falsehood of whose concurring testimony shall be greater than the improbability of the alleged miracle.&lt;/em&gt; (Babbage 1837: 202, emphasis original; cf. Holder 1998 and Earman 2000)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, comparing with Hume, it becomes obvious why this spin fails:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When anyone tells me, that he saw a dead man restored to life, I immediately consider with myself, whether it be more probable, that this person should either deceive or be deceived, or that the fact, which he relates, should have really happened. I weigh the one miracle against the other; and according to the superiority, which I discover, I pronounce my decision, and always reject the greater miracle. If the falsehood of the testimony would be more miraculous, than the event which he relates; then, and not till then, can he pretend to command my belief or opinion. (Hume)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first quote implies that the terms &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(T_1|M)\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(T_1|\sim\!M)\)&lt;/span&gt; refer to speaking truth vs falsehoods (i.e. lying), as opposed to speaking correctly vs being mistaken.  In the latter, it is very easy to see why, for certain types of extraordinary events, we would expect fallible observers to have &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(T_1|\sim\!M)&amp;gt;P(T_1|M)\)&lt;/span&gt; and further that even &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; witnesses were in general slightly more reliable than not, we can't expect the observations to be &lt;em&gt;independent&lt;/em&gt; in general.  In the specific case of the (anonymous) Gospel writers, there is strong evidence of &lt;em&gt;dependence&lt;/em&gt; in the accounts to make this entire calculation (except in its gross qualitative features) irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="arguments-against-miracles"&gt;Arguments against miracles&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quoting Hume again,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plain consequence is (and it is a general maxim worthy of our attention), “That no testimony is sufficient to establish a miracle, unless the testimony be of such a kind, that its falsehood would be more miraculous, than the fact, which it endeavors to establish: And even in that case, there is a mutual destruction of arguments, and the superior only gives us an assurance suitable to that degree of force, which remains, after deducting the inferior.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is correct, and is a direct statement of Bayesian reasoning
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$
\frac{P(M|E)}{P(\sim\!M|E)} =\frac{P(E|M)}{P(E|\sim\!M)} \times\frac{P(M)}{P(\sim\!M)}
$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
where we can use the approximations &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(E|M)\approx 1\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(\sim\!M)\approx 1\)&lt;/span&gt; and achieve
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$
\frac{P(M|E)}{P(\sim\!M|E)} \approx \frac{P(M)}{P(E|\sim\!M)}
$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/miracles/"&gt;article on miracles&lt;/a&gt; continues to try to map this to a philosophical structure (needlessly, I'd say), with the following "simple version" of the argument:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very simple version of the argument, leaving out the comparison to the laws of nature and focusing on the alleged infirmities of testimony, can be laid out deductively (following Whately, in Paley 1859: 33):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Testimony is a kind of evidence very likely to be false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) The evidence for the Christian miracles is testimony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) The evidence for the Christian miracles is likely to be false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is, however, much too crude an argument to carry any weight, since it turns on a simple ambiguity between all testimony and some testimony. Whately offers an amusing parody that makes the fallacy obvious: Some books are mere trash; Hume's Works are [some] books; therefore, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's remarkable that such a silly parallel is seriously made.  The structure isn't really parallel at all, so let's make it explicit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Books are likely to be trash. (in other words, most books are trash)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hume wrote some books&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;therefore, Hume's books are likely to be trash.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a correct argument, given the premises.  If all we knew was that "some guy named Hume" wrote "some book", then with all probability (if premise 1. is correct) that book would be trash.  The issue is that, unconsciously, we are inserting extra information - Hume was a famous philosopher, he had a particular education, etc...  With this extra information, we would have a hard time supporting a similar premise as 1. above.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that this is so trivially dispensed with makes one wonder - why would anyone be convinced by this?  Why couldn't the author of the article see it?  It smacks of grasping at straws to try to dispel Hume's main arguments.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article continues with some odd re-phrasings of Hume, where the mathematics is just the single line above.  I don't understand all the work.  A strange one is then critiqued with an even stranger statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presumptive case against the resurrection from universal testimony would be as strong as Hume supposes only if, &lt;em&gt;per impossible&lt;/em&gt;, all mankind throughout all ages had been watching the tomb of Jesus on the morning of the third day and testified that nothing occurred. Even aside from the problems of time travel, there is not a &lt;em&gt;single piece&lt;/em&gt; of direct testimonial evidence to Jesus' non-resurrection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does anyone seriously think that the case against a claim always (or even usually) takes the form of direct testimony against that claim?  Where is the testimony that Zeus didn't exist?  Anyone who can explain this odd line of reasoning, please chime in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="particular-arguments"&gt;Particular Arguments&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the article, Hume lists a set of conditions needed to make testimony carry maximum weight:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[T]here is not to be found, in all history, any miracle attested by a sufficient number of men, of such unquestioned good sense, education, and learning, as to secure us against all delusion in themselves; of such undoubted integrity, as to place them beyond all suspicion of any design to deceive others; of such credit and reputation in the eyes of mankind, as to have a great deal to lose in case of their being detected in any falsehood; and at the same time attesting facts, performed in such a public manner, and in so celebrated a part of the world, as to render the detection unavoidable: All which circumstances are requisite to give us a full assurance in the testimony of men. (Hume 1748/2000: 88)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, he is saying that the methods of science have never confirmed a miracle.  The methods of science help "secure us against all delusion in themselves", remove "suspicion of any design to deceive others", with processes "performed in a public manner" that "render the detection unavoidable".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is criticized by noting that some of these conditions can cut the other way, such as the condition of "credit and reputation",&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might have been said with some shew of plausibility, that such persons by their knowledge and abilities, their reputation and interest, might have it in their power to countenance and propagate an imposture among the people, and give it some credit in the world. (Leland 1755: 90–91; cf. Beckett 1883: 29–37)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is, essentially, pointing out fallacy of authority - a good critique.  Science, by its processes, attempts to avoid that as well.  Of course, Hume predates modern science, so I think we can forgive him some sloppiness or poor choice of terminology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hume continues to suggest that the religious context of the miracle claime makes the telling of the miracle story even more likely.  This would increase the probability of obtaining the testimony even if no miracle happened - &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(E|\sim\!M)\)&lt;/span&gt; increases - making the probability of a miracle go down.  The criticism here?  The effect could happen in the other direction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as George Campbell points out (1762/1839: 48–49), this consideration cuts both ways; the religious nature of the claim may also operate to make it less readily received:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[T]he prejudice resulting from the religious affection, may just as readily obstruct as promote our faith in a religious miracle. What things in nature are more contrary, than one religion is to another religion? They are just as contrary as light and darkness, truth and error. The affections with which they are contemplated by the same person, are just as opposite as desire and aversion, love and hatred. The same religious zeal which gives the mind of a Christian a propensity to the belief of a miracle in support of Christianity, will inspire him with an aversion from the belief of a miracle in support of Mahometanism. The same principle which will make him acquiesce in evidence less than sufficient in one case, will make him require evidence more than sufficient in the other….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I disagree quite strongly with this line of thinking.  One of the big problems with pseudoscience is that it promotes poor thinking in other domains.  Someone who believes in miracles will not find it hard to believe that the miracle claims of other religions are at least possible.  If you believe in unseen agents, then to move from Christianity to New Age to Scientology isn't that large of a stretch.  Often, when ones religion is undermined, the typical response is to switch to another religion!  Thus, they are not as opposite as "light and darkness".  Poor thinking is poor thinking, regardless of the context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="argument-from-parity"&gt;Argument from Parity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hume brings up miracles in other religions.  In a fit of special pleading, the &lt;a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/miracles/"&gt;article on miracles&lt;/a&gt; retorts,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All attempts to draw an evidential parallel between the miracles of the New Testament and the miracle stories of later ecclesiastical history are therefore dubious. There are simply more resources for explaining how the ecclesiastical stories, which were promoted to an established and favorably disposed audience, could have arisen and been believed without there being any truth to the reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The argument is quite simple - if there are known cases of miracle claims where no miracle actually occurred, that increase &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(E|\sim\!M)\)&lt;/span&gt;, making the probability of a miracle go down given testimony.  It doesn't matter whether you have good reasons to believe there was no miracle for these cases - it undermines testimony of miracles in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="in-conclusion"&gt;In conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as far as I can tell, there is no substantive critique to Hume's statements about miracles.  He lacks the rigor of the mathematics of probability, but his wording is so straightforwardly translated to it that I find it difficult to see what the problem is.  I also found it ironic that the entire article, which has been pro-miracle the entire time, ends with this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the evidence for a miracle claim, being public and empirical, is never strictly demonstrative, either as to the fact of the event or as to the supernatural cause of the event. It remains possible, though the facts in the case may in principle render it wildly improbable, that the testifier is either a deceiver or himself deceived; and so long as those possibilities exist, there will be logical space for other forms of evidence to bear on the conclusion. Arguments about miracles therefore take their place as one piece—a fascinating piece—in a larger and more important puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is pretty much exactly what Hume was saying.  Given that there is always a non-zero probability of the testifier either lying or being mistaken, one has to establish the evidence for a miracle strong enough to overcome both the negligibly small prior probability and this non-zero probability of the testimony being wrong.  Since mistakes are a common human trait, and distortions are also common on testimony, evidence for miracles according to probability theory, Hume, and all rational thought have always been found lacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, if you could demonstrate it otherwise, please let me know!  I'd love to believe in miracles.  I just have never seen anything even remotely convincing.  &lt;/p&gt;

The core of the article is in the third paragraph:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there’s something missing in their critiques, something fundamental. For all their eloquence, their arguments are often banal. Regrettably, they’ve shown little interest in understanding the religious compulsion. They talk incessantly about the untruth of religion because they assume truth is what matters most to religious people. And perhaps it does for many, but certainly not all – at least not in the conventional sense of that term. Religious convictions, in many cases, are held not because they’re true but because they’re meaningful, because they’re personally transformative. New Atheists are blind to this brand of belief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another gem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, most religious people consider their beliefs true in some sense, but that’s to be expected: the consolation derived from a belief is greater if its illusory origins are concealed. The point is that such beliefs aren’t held because they’re true as such; they’re accepted on faith because they’re meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just ask yourself, if you swapped out "religion" in the texts above, and inserted astrology, witchcraft, alien visitation, scientology, 911 Truther or Anti-vaccination, would the author still have such a glib response to the lack of evidence?  These all give their adherents meaning, a feeling of belonging to something greater than themselves, or an importance to themselves that they wouldn't otherwise have.  Who are we to criticize these?  They "consider their beliefs true in some sense" but gain some "consolation derived from the belief", and thus these "beliefs aren’t held because they’re true as such; they’re accepted on faith because they’re meaningful".  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially Sean Illing is saying that it doesn't matter whether the belief is true, it only matters if it makes you feel good.  Of course he excludes himself from these false notions with "many people (myself included) find no practical advantage in believing things without evidence. But what about those who do?"  What a patronizing and arrogant thing to say!  Seems like he's projecting a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does Sean Illing not see the dangers in this line of reasoning?  It &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; matter if people believe things without evidence.  It &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; matter that, even in the cases where the belief is "content free", that the believers are using the same vocabulary as the fanatics - and thus provide intellectual cover for the fanatics.  It &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; matter that believing in something merely because it gives you meaning, or makes you feel good, is a bad idea.  How much legitimate meaning could be derived from beliefs that are not well supported by evidence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the message of the so-called New Atheists, and it is not arrogant. &lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Expressing Ignorance</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/expressing-ignorance.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-05-09T00:00:00-04:00</published><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2015-05-09:expressing-ignorance.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I continue with my critique of the article &lt;a href="https://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2015/04/16/why-i-am-not-a-bayesian/"&gt;Why I am not a Bayesian&lt;/a&gt; by Greg Mayer, where complains about the Bayesian approach to inference, and then espouses Maximum Likelihood methods.  &lt;a href="http://web.bryant.edu/~bblais/priors-vs-likelihoods.html"&gt;My previous post&lt;/a&gt; looked at the notion of prior vs likelihood, why we commonly use priors (even without always knowing it), and why they are necessary for hypothesis comparison.  Here I wanted to focus on what I consider to be his biggest issue with the Bayes approach, and it is technical in nature.  It happens to be the same issue that I've heard from others - how to specify priors.  Mayer goes further, and says that the specification of ignorance is not well defined.  I admit that there may be cases where that is true, but I haven't seen a convincing one yet.  In the article he outlines the following argument against specifying initial ignorance with a prior:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at simple genetic example: a gene with two alleles (forms) at the locus (say alleles &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(A\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(a\)&lt;/span&gt;). The two alleles have frequencies &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(p + q = 1\)&lt;/span&gt;, and, if there are no evolutionary forces acting on the population and mating is at random, then the three genotypes (&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(AA\)&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(Aa\)&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(aa\)&lt;/span&gt;) will have the frequencies &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(p^2\)&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(2pq\)&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(q^2\)&lt;/span&gt;, respectively. If I am addressing the frequency of allele &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(a\)&lt;/span&gt;, and I am a Bayesian, then I assign equal prior probability to all possible values of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(q\)&lt;/span&gt;, so&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(q&amp;gt;.5) = 0.5\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this implies that the frequency of the &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(aa\)&lt;/span&gt; genotype has a non-uniform prior probability distribution&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(q^2&amp;gt;0.25) = 0.5\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My ignorance concerning &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(q\)&lt;/span&gt; has become rather definite knowledge concerning &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(q^2\)&lt;/span&gt; (which, if there is genetic dominance at the locus, would be the frequency of recessive homozygotes; as in Mendel’s short pea plants, this is a very common way in which we observe the data). This apparent conversion of ‘ignorance’ to ‘knowledge’ will be generally so: prior probabilities are not invariant to parameter transformation (in this case, the transformation is the squaring of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(q\)&lt;/span&gt;). And even more generally, there will be no unique, objective distribution for ignorance. Lacking a genuine prior distribution (which we do have in the diagnosis example above), reasonable men may disagree on how to represent their ignorance. As Royall (1997) put it, “pure ignorance cannot be represented by a probability distribution”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This example intrigued me because of its simplicity - it must have some solution.  It also gave me an excuse to play with &lt;a href="http://plot.ly"&gt;plotly, the online plotting program&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://dan.iel.fm/emcee/current/"&gt;emcee: The MCMC Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, both of which I had been meaning to get some practice in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Probability is a measure of our &lt;em&gt;state of knowledge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we gain new information about our system, our &lt;em&gt;state of knowledge&lt;/em&gt; changes, and thus the &lt;em&gt;probabilities&lt;/em&gt; we assign must change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Humans are bad an intuiting where information comes from in some cases, and thus often mistakenly think that two problems are equivalent when they are not. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mayer's critique of priors with this genetic example is an example of point (3), and we outline that with a model analogy.  In sum, the "apparent conversion of ‘ignorance’ to ‘knowledge’" that Greg Mayer is so concerned about is in fact not just apparent - it is explicit.  This is not due to some arcane mathematics on priors, but to &lt;em&gt;added information&lt;/em&gt;.  What Mayer's considers to be equivalent situations - knowledge of only two possible states, and knowledge of the process that produces those states - are not equivalent at all.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-model-part-1"&gt;The Model - Part 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model that I'm using comes in two steps.  The first step concerns the observation of a system with two states, call them &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(+\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(-\)&lt;/span&gt;, and we want to infer from the observations of these states what the underlying probabilities, denoted &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\theta_+\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\theta_-\)&lt;/span&gt; respectively, are.  The observed data is something as simple as the number observed in one state vs the other, such as
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{eqnarray*}
N_+ &amp;amp;=&amp;amp; 16 \\
N_- &amp;amp;=&amp;amp; 4 \\
N&amp;amp;\equiv&amp;amp; N_+ + N_- = 20
\end{eqnarray*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution to this is achieved with a straightforward application of Bayes' rule:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{eqnarray*}
P(\theta_+|{\rm data}) &amp;amp;=&amp;amp; P({\rm data}|\theta_+)\times P(\theta_+)/K \\
P(\theta_-|{\rm data}) &amp;amp;=&amp;amp; \underbrace{P({\rm data}|-)}_{\rm likelihood}\times  \underbrace{P(\theta_-)}_{\rm prior}/K
\end{eqnarray*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;with normalization constant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{eqnarray*}
K\equiv P({\rm data}|\theta_+)\times P(\theta_+) + P({\rm data}|\theta_-)\times P(\theta_-)
\end{eqnarray*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
and where the data is defined as 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{eqnarray*}
{\rm data}&amp;amp;\equiv &amp;amp; \left\{ N_+,N \right\}
\end{eqnarray*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
or equivalently
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{eqnarray*}
{\rm data}&amp;amp;\equiv &amp;amp; \left\{ N_-,N \right\}
\end{eqnarray*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although analytical solutions exist for this problem, I'll solve it with MCMC both to work on my implementation, but also to see how this could be applied to more challenging cases.  To do this, we specify the log-prior and log-likelihoods for our parameters.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="prior"&gt;Prior&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that we know &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; about the origin of these states or the process which gives rise to these states, we only observe how many there are.  Thus, we have &lt;em&gt;total ignorance&lt;/em&gt; of the &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\theta_-\)&lt;/span&gt; parameter, and we assign a uniform prior probability to reflect that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$
P(\theta_-) = \left\{\begin{array}{cl}1 &amp;amp; \mbox{ for } 0 \le \theta_- \le 1 \\
0 &amp;amp; \mbox{ otherwise } 
\end{array}\right.
$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="likelihood"&gt;Likelihood&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this is a straightforward Bernoulli process, we have for the likelihood&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$
P({\rm data}|\theta_-) = \left(\begin{array}{c}N  \\ N_- \end{array}\right) \theta_{-}^{N_-}\times (1-\theta_-)^{N-N-}
$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="result"&gt;Result&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resulting posterior for &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\theta_-\)&lt;/span&gt; is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href="https://plot.ly/~bblais/77/" target="_blank" title="$\hat{\theta_-}|^{97.5}_{2.5}=0.219^{+0.200}_{-0.137}$" style="display: block; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://plot.ly/~bblais/77.png" alt="$\hat{\theta_-}|^{97.5}_{2.5}=0.219^{+0.200}_{-0.137}$" style="max-width: 100%;"  onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='https://plot.ly/404.png';" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;script data-plotly="bblais:77" src="https://plot.ly/embed.js" async&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, clearly there is an analytic solution to this part, but that isn't the point.  And I'm not sure whether the second part has an easy solution, but the MCMC approach is just as easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="model-part-2"&gt;Model - Part 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second step in the model is when we get some detail of the &lt;em&gt;process&lt;/em&gt; by which the &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(+\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(-\)&lt;/span&gt; states are generated.  Here is the recipe:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I flip a two identical thumbtacks, each of which can land with the point up (&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(U\)&lt;/span&gt;) or down (&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(D\)&lt;/span&gt;) - and I don't know anything about the probability of these two cases. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If either (or both) of the tacks lands with the point up, that is reported as the &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(+\)&lt;/span&gt; state.  The only remaining case (i.e. both tacks land pointing down), is reported as the &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(-\)&lt;/span&gt; state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have, then, the following mapping:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(UU \rightarrow +\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(UD \rightarrow +\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(DU \rightarrow +\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(DD \rightarrow -\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parallel with alleles should be obvious.  By keeping it to a simple physical model, I avoid the extra complexities of genetic inheritance, and other biological processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This model, again, is a basic problem in probability, but note the following very important point:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our knowledge of the system has changed, so our probabilities must also change.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only difference is that our ignorance is now on &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\theta_U\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\theta_D\)&lt;/span&gt;, and the probabilities for the &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(+\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(-\)&lt;/span&gt; states are &lt;em&gt;derived&lt;/em&gt; from that, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{eqnarray*}
\theta_- &amp;amp;=&amp;amp; \theta_D^2 \\
\theta_+ &amp;amp;=&amp;amp; 1-\theta_-
\end{eqnarray*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we have posterior for the underlying parameters, such as &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\theta_D\)&lt;/span&gt;, as well as for the state parameters, such &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\theta_-\)&lt;/span&gt;, which are determined entirely from the underlying parameters.  The posterior for &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\theta_D\)&lt;/span&gt; is 
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href="https://plot.ly/~bblais/84/" target="_blank" title="&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\hat{\theta_D}|^{97.5}_{2.5}=0.447^{+0.187}_{-0.184}\)&lt;/span&gt;" style="display: block; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://plot.ly/~bblais/84.png" alt="&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\hat{\theta_D}|^{97.5}_{2.5}=0.447^{+0.187}_{-0.184}\)&lt;/span&gt;" style="max-width: 100%;"  onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='https://plot.ly/404.png';" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;script data-plotly="bblais:84" src="https://plot.ly/embed.js" async&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
while the posterior for &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\theta_-\)&lt;/span&gt; in the Model 2 is
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href="https://plot.ly/~bblais/85/" target="_blank" title="&lt;span class="math"&gt;\({\hat{\theta}_-}|^{97.5}_{2.5}=0.200^{+0.202}_{-0.131}\)&lt;/span&gt;" style="display: block; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://plot.ly/~bblais/85.png" alt="&lt;span class="math"&gt;\({\hat{\theta}_-}|^{97.5}_{2.5}=0.200^{+0.202}_{-0.131}\)&lt;/span&gt;" style="max-width: 100%;"  onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='https://plot.ly/404.png';" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;script data-plotly="bblais:85" src="https://plot.ly/embed.js" async&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="comparisons-and-conclusions"&gt;Comparisons and conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a bit more convenient to plot the consequences of Model 1 (ignorance in +/-) and Model 2 (ignorance in U/D), with the same data, both together on the same plot.
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href="https://plot.ly/~bblais/86/" target="_blank" title="Ignorance on +/- vs Ignorance on U/D" style="display: block; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://plot.ly/~bblais/86.png" alt="Ignorance on +/- vs Ignorance on U/D" style="max-width: 100%;"  onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='https://plot.ly/404.png';" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;script data-plotly="bblais:86" src="https://plot.ly/embed.js" async&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
We can easily see that, although they are different, there is no &lt;em&gt;practical&lt;/em&gt; difference between them given this data. For larger &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(N\)&lt;/span&gt; this difference gets less significant.
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href="https://plot.ly/~bblais/87/" target="_blank" title="Ignorance on +/- vs Ignorance on U/D" style="display: block; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://plot.ly/~bblais/87.png" alt="Ignorance on +/- vs Ignorance on U/D" style="max-width: 100%;"  onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='https://plot.ly/404.png';" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;script data-plotly="bblais:87" src="https://plot.ly/embed.js" async&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In sum, the "apparent conversion of ‘ignorance’ to ‘knowledge’" that Greg Mayer is so concerned about is in fact not just apparent - it is explicit.  This is not due to some arcane mathematics on priors, but to &lt;em&gt;added information&lt;/em&gt;.  What Mayer's considers to be equivalent situations - knowledge of only two possible states, and knowledge of the process that produces those states - are not equivalent at all.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, for this problem, it makes very little difference whether you think of things in terms of Model 1 or Model 2 except in the case of extremely rare underlying events.  This is also as it should be - if you know that the process essentially hides the existence of itself (i.e. the recessive gene is not observed phenotypically) - then you would assign a lower probability for the phenotype than you would if you only knew that there were two possible states and knew nothing about the properties of recessive characteristics.  To repeat, different states of knowledge require different probability assignments - this is a feature, not a bug.&lt;/p&gt;

There is much to critique in the article, but let's consider one question he raises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three ways round the problem of prior distributions. First, try really hard to find an objective way of portraying ignorance. This hasn’t worked yet, but some people are still trying. Second, note that the prior probabilities make little difference to the posterior probabilty as more and more data accumulate (i.e. as more experiments/observations provide more likelihoods), viz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P(posterior) ∝ P(prior) × Likelihood  × Likelihood × Likelihood × . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, only the likelihoods make a difference; but this is less a defense of Bayesianism than a surrender to likelihood. Third, boldly embrace subjectivity. But then, since everyone has their own prior, the only thing we can agree upon are the likelihoods.  So, why not just use the likelihoods?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with Bayesianism is that it asks the wrong question. It asks, ‘How should I modify my current beliefs in the light of the data?’, rather than ‘Which hypotheses are best supported by the data?’. Bayesianism tells me (and me alone) what to believe, while likelihood tells us (all of us) what the data say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I follow his question of "why not just use the likelihoods" with the following question:  Given that &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_the_Octopus"&gt;Paul the Octopus&lt;/a&gt; predicted 12 out of 14 World Cup matches, does Greg Mayer accept that the octopus is psychic?  Why or why not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My guess is "no", but why?  The &lt;em&gt;likelihood&lt;/em&gt; (i.e. how well the hypothesis supports the data) is exceptionally high. Higher, I'd say, than nearly any other hypothesis.  Actually, now that I think about it, the hypothesis "aliens that like the number 12 and influence octopi made it happen" is a better one.  These are clearly ridiculous because they are &lt;em&gt;implausible&lt;/em&gt; to start, and thus have a lower &lt;em&gt;prior probability&lt;/em&gt;.  In fact Bayesianism is asking the only interesting question, and it provides the framework to actually compare hypotheses, something that frequentist methods fail spectacularly at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greg Mayer is a Bayesian, he just fails to admit it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Superseding the $t$ test</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/superseding-the-t-test.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-04-23T00:00:00-04:00</published><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2015-04-23:superseding-the-t-test.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;There's a very nice paper, &lt;a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~kruschke/articles/Kruschke2013JEPG.pdf"&gt;Bayesian estimation supersedes the t test&lt;/a&gt;. John K. Kruschke, Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 2013, v.142(2), pp.573-603. The methods described provide at once posterior probabilities not just for the means of two groups, but their standard deviations, their normality, and effect size.  The &lt;a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~kruschke/BEST/"&gt;supporting website&lt;/a&gt; has a lot of useful resources, including a number of implementations.  The original implementation is in R, but there is a &lt;a href="https://github.com/strawlab/best"&gt;Python implementation using PyMC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to implement the same thing using the &lt;a href="http://dan.iel.fm/emcee/current/"&gt;emcee package&lt;/a&gt;.  The full implementation is &lt;a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/bblais/7a1c6ec3b4c8d1b0465f"&gt;viewable here&lt;/a&gt;.  My implementation is pretty general, and can handle some arbitrary tests of the variables, like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class="highlighttable"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="linenos"&gt;&lt;div class="linenodiv"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;1

&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.85502222222222224&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;table class="highlighttable"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="linenos"&gt;&lt;div class="linenodiv"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;1&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class="code"&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;plot_distribution&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Effect Size=(mu1-mu2)/sqrt((sigma1**2+sigma2**2)/2)&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

T. Jaynes wrote extensively about Bayesian inference, and one of his strategies was to use a "Galileo's telescope for statistics", such as outlined in his paper on &lt;a href="http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/confidence.pdf"&gt;Confidence Intervals vs Bayesian Intervals&lt;/a&gt;.  This method is used to distinguish between two alternate approaches to a problem.  The strategy entails finding particularly simple cases where the two cases yield very different answers, and the correct one is obvious from the context and the simplicity of the problem.  In this way, the difference is magnified like a telescope so that it is clear to the unaided observation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are, I've found, similar sorts of cases in apologetics.  There are a few questions I've heard that are so simple, yet get to the heart of the matter.  I've collected them here, and always enjoy finding others.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="is-there-free-will-in-heaven"&gt;Is there free will in Heaven?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is, then the free-will argument for the the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_evil"&gt;Problem of Evil&lt;/a&gt; falls apart.  If there is not, then heaven is filled with automatons and the soul is meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="how-did-paul-know-it-was-jesus-that-he-saw"&gt;How did Paul know it was Jesus that he saw?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Paul wasn't an eyewitness to Jesus, how did he know that he was being visited by Jesus in a vision?  How does he know that he saw the same person that others saw?  Thus, even at best, how do we know as readers that his testimony is reliable at all, as the apologists claim?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="how-did-you-determine-in-the-bible-that-god-is-the-good-guy-and-satan-is-the-bad-guy"&gt;How did you determine in the Bible that God is the good guy and Satan is the bad guy?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one points to the real source of morality - ourselves.  We use our own moral intuitions to decide which parts of the Bible are worth keeping and which to ignore.  Even if you look at the beginning of Genesis, the snake is the one that is correct about the Tree of Knowledge when God is not.  Using the argument that God's book says that God is good is, obviously, fallacious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="why-does-paul-never-use-the-word-disciple-and-only-uses-the-word-apostle"&gt;Why does Paul &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; use the word disciple and only uses the word apostle?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one isn't quite as strong, but it was the one that got me thinking about the evidence (or lack of evidence) for the existence of Jesus.  This simple question highlights the fact that Paul never mentions anything about the life of Jesus at all.  He doesn't seem to be aware that Peter and James, for example, were supposedly disciples of of Jesus - following an actual person - not just apostles - spreading the word about Jesus.  He never mentions Nazareth, or anything at all that Jesus said - not a single quote from Jesus is found in any of Paul's writing, and he is the earliest and most prolific New Testament writer.  I find that really interesting.  For me, it makes me agnostic about Jesus existing at all as a historical figure.  I've never seen a compelling case either way.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are there any more such questions?&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Misquoting Hume</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/misquoting-hume.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-02-21T00:00:00-05:00</published><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2015-02-21:misquoting-hume.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recall a comment in E. T. Jaynes' book about Laplace, where he realized that most of the arguments against the claims of Laplace were arguments against things Laplace never said.  Jaynes would habitually check the original source whenever he heard claims ascribed to Laplace, and found that Laplace was consistently misquoted.  Recently, I have realized that the same can be said of Hume.   I've &lt;a href="http://web.bryant.edu/~bblais/will-the-sun-rise-tomorrow.html"&gt;written before&lt;/a&gt; about the claim that Hume believed we have "no good reason at all for thinking the sun will rise tomorrow" (spoiler alert: he didn't believe this). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I've seen this little pithy Hume quote: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The evidence for the regular is always greater than that for the rare."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in &lt;a href="http://www.bethinking.org/are-miracles-possible/the-question-of-miracles-the-contemporary-influence-of-hume"&gt;various&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.roomfordoubt.com/examine/2/Questions-of-Faith/11/Don-t-miracles-violate-the-laws-of-nature-Isn-t-that-just-unbelievable"&gt;critiques&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.mbu.edu/seminary/journal/a-critique-of-david-humes-on-miracles/"&gt;of Hume&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=FPmV30uX1_4C&amp;amp;pg=PA207&amp;amp;lpg=PA207&amp;amp;dq=%22The+evidence+for+the+regular+is+always+greater+than+that+for+the+rare%22&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=d9it4bTi3N&amp;amp;sig=5D-zAM9UJ0CkkM17J0ovbCWR9XY&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=w6HoVN6PHpbbsATFgIGADg&amp;amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=%22The%20evidence%20for%20the%20regular%20is%20always%20greater%20than%20that%20for%20the%20rare%22&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;on the web&lt;/a&gt;.  The problem?  Hume never says this.  You can read Hume's &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; statements about miracles in the two parts of his argument here: &lt;a href="http://www.bartleby.com/37/3/14.html"&gt;part 1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.bartleby.com/37/3/15.html"&gt;part 2&lt;/a&gt;.  The misquotes that I have seen are always from Christian apologists, so it isn't totally surprising.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think one of the reasons this occurs is that Hume predates probability theory, so he uses verbose explanations where the modern reader can insert a single statement.  For example, reading Hume's work on Miracles, it is clear to me that what he intends to say is simply&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the &lt;em&gt;prior probability&lt;/em&gt; for the regular is always greater than the rare &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a bit less pithy, but more correct (although Hume doesn't phrase it quite like that either).  This is at least a factual statement - before the data, we should believe the regular over the rare.  That doesn't imply that data couldn't &lt;em&gt;convince&lt;/em&gt; us of rare events, it only implies that it is more &lt;em&gt;difficult&lt;/em&gt; for data to convince us of rare vs regular events (i.e. you need better evidence for the rare).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an &lt;a href="http://ez.premierchristianradio.com/radio/Shows/Saturday/Unbelievable/Episodes/Unbelievable-9-Aug-2008-Norman-Geisler-American-Masters-of-Apologetics-pt-4"&gt;Unbelievable podcast interview with apologist Norman Geisler&lt;/a&gt;, Geisler uses the first "quote" of Hume above, and then argues that Hume must be wrong because science already accepts singular and rare events - the Big Bang, the origin of life, and macro evolution (this last one is, of course, neither singular nor rare).  Geisler then concludes that miracles can exist!  However, seen in the light of probability theory, it becomes clear.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prior probability of the events is low:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
P(\mbox{Big Bang})\ll 1 \\\\
P(\mbox{Origin of Life})\ll 1 \\\\
P(\mbox{Macro Evolution})\ll 1 \\\\
P(\mbox{Miracles})\ll 1
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
but with data, we have something quite different:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
P(\mbox{Big Bang}|{\rm data})\sim 1 \\\\
P(\mbox{Origin of Life}|{\rm data})\sim 1 \\\\
P(\mbox{Macro Evolution}|{\rm data})\sim 1 \\\\
P(\mbox{Miracles}|{\rm data})\sim  0
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
where the data are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Big Bang - &lt;a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/astronomy/bigbang.html"&gt;a long list&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Origin of Life - a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis"&gt;nice summary&lt;/a&gt; with RNA world, and autocatalysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Macro Evolution - a term not used by biologists, but &lt;a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/"&gt;another long list&lt;/a&gt; for evolution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Miracles - nothing convincing to the scientific community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, although all these things &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; occur, only a few of them &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; have evidence strong enough to overcome their initial low prior probability.  Hume recognized this for miracles, as was clear from his writings, although it would have been clearer had he had the benefit of probabilistic vocabulary.  Don't take my word for it, go read Hume &lt;a href="http://www.bartleby.com/37/3/14.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.bartleby.com/37/3/15.html"&gt;and here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

I've spoken to this issue &lt;a href="http://web.bryant.edu/~bblais/closed-to-the-supernatural.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://web.bryant.edu/~bblais/the-supernatural-and-the-history-of-cosmology.html"&gt;again here&lt;/a&gt;, where I refer to the term "supernatural" as a label-of-the-gaps, and trace its usage in ancient cosmology.  I've stated that the term itself is either content-free or not defined specifically enough to be useful.  However, I do make the following statement which I think points to Fishman's perspective:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd love to see something that really rises to the level of a miracle, like the 10 commandments etched in Pluto or something. Although technically a God-of-the-Gaps argument, it would be very interesting indeed! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can ask the question, what would convince you of the existence of the supernatural, or of God?  Fishman points out that if prayer actually worked, and only Catholic prayers were effective, that would in fact be evidence for the supernatural.  What I find interesting about this line of thinking is that, even if you expect that there should be a natural explanation, if the person claiming supernatural agency continues to make specific predictions that turn out true - predictions that, at least on the face, seem to be unexpected from our current understanding - then you'd have to start thinking that they are on to something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I think is going on here is something a bit different than a God-of-the-gaps, at least in some contexts.  One way of thinking about it is with an analogy to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter"&gt;Dark Matter&lt;/a&gt;.  In astronomy it was observed that galaxies rotated more rapidly than expected.  Using the light emitted from the galaxy, you can estimate the amount of material needed to emit that light, and use that to determine rotation speeds.  The amount of mass estimated from the light emitted is far less than the amount of mass estimated from the rotation speeds - somehow there is a large amount of mass unaccounted for.  Astronomers named this extra mass "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter"&gt;Dark Matter&lt;/a&gt;".  Notice, that this is not an &lt;em&gt;explanation&lt;/em&gt; for the extra mass, but a &lt;em&gt;label&lt;/em&gt; for "something I don't know is causing this effect".  One then has to make propositions of specific causes, like neutrinos, black holes, or even modifications of the laws of physics.  From there one makes specific predictions, constructs methods for testing the propositions, and explores alternatives.  The term, "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter"&gt;Dark Matter&lt;/a&gt;", is still used as the umbrella term to label all of these alternatives.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this way, the term "supernatural" may be a label for "something I don't know is causing this effect", where the effect may be a miracle claim, prayers answered, origin of the universe, origin of life, etc...  Thus, the phrase "supernatural explanation" is a meaningless phrase - there can be no supernatural explanation, just as Dark Matter is not an explanation.  However, as Fishman uses in his title, one could test "supernatural worldviews" - those constructions that use the label to suggest some unknown (and possibly unknowable) agency at work.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One might think that a scientific theory can't have anything like this in it, but that is not correct.  For example, consider the wavefunction in quantum mechanics.  Here we have an entity in a theory which is not directly observable - even in principle - yet the theory makes very specific predictions.  It is possible to have such entities in a scientific theory, and we accept such entities in so far as the predictions which come from them are observed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a certain appeal to this way of thinking, and I feel that an honest assessment of religious claims could proceed in this way.  However, I think more people use "supernatural" as an excuse, a truly God-of-the-gaps, and stop all inquiry into alternatives.  They see it as an explanation, not a label, but fail to make the next proper step of following the predictions - everything is a post-diction.  You say that the universe is finely tuned for life because of God?  Ok, what suggestion can you make for the next cosmological experiment to perform?  What experiment would you propose to distinguish your theory (with supernatural entities) from a theory of physical necessity (i.e. the constants must be that way) or statistical necessity (i.e. the multiverse)?  You say that the supernatural is needed to understand prayers being answered?  Sure, but how would you test that?  How would you explain the (many) failed experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of prayer, and propose an alternative?  These experiments should be easy to propose, if one is not just applying a God-of-the-gaps.  Of course, we don't see these experiments proposed.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in summary, science cannot test supernatural &lt;em&gt;explanations&lt;/em&gt;, because they are not defined.  They can test specific predictions that incorporate unknown, and possibly unknowable, entities that have direct physical effects.   In most cases of religious claims including supernatural effects there are no predictions made, and thus the term is empty and useless - an excuse for the intellectually lazy.  Where specific predictions have been made (e.g. efficacy of prayer, existence of specific miracles, etc...) the predictions have not been supported.  In this way, science can test God...and God has failed the test. &lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>How to Deflate a Football Deflating Story</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/how-to-deflate-a-football-deflating-story.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-01-23T00:00:00-05:00</published><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2015-01-23:how-to-deflate-a-football-deflating-story.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="images/football.jpg" width=400px&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, it's all over the news, the &lt;a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2015/01/20/nfl-says-patriots-used-under-inflated-footballs/7UlPZI3eotRTBadM89saeO/story.html"&gt;Patriots cheated&lt;/a&gt; with deflating the football by 1-2 psi, and are &lt;a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2339195-is-the-nfl-going-to-let-brady-and-belichick-play-it-for-a-fool"&gt;lying about not knowing anything about it&lt;/a&gt;.  There are even claims that there are &lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/science/2015/01/23/deflate-gate-science-underinflated-footballs/"&gt;scientific reasons for this being an advantage&lt;/a&gt;.  What seems to be lacking at this point is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;any actual evidence of wrongdoing - no video, no eyewitnesses, nothing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;any actual &lt;em&gt;data&lt;/em&gt; concerning the footballs in question, i.e. their actual pressures at various times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;any actual &lt;em&gt;data&lt;/em&gt; concerning all of the footballs in the game, i.e. their actual pressures at various times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only data we have is that the balls were measured later in the game, with an observed drop from the beginning of the game, and a possible way to benefit from that.  The first thing we have to ask is, are there any mundane explanations of this observation?  The second thing we have to ask is if there is a way to distinguish between the mundane explanations and the possible nefarious ones.  Let's tackle the first.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="can-temperature-change-account-for-the-data-yes"&gt;Can Temperature Change Account for the Data?  Yes!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When measuring the pressure in a football, we measure the &lt;em&gt;difference&lt;/em&gt; between the pressure inside of the football and the atmospheric pressure.  Atmospheric pressure is about 14.7 psi, so when the reading of the football pressure is, say, 13 psi then the absolute pressure is &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{equation}
14.7 \,{\rm psi} + 13 \,{\rm psi} = 27.7 \,{\rm psi}
\end{equation}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the ideal gas law we also have the relationship between pressure and temperature,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
PV&amp;amp;=&amp;amp;nkT \\\\
P&amp;amp;\propto&amp;amp; T \\\\
\frac{P_1}{P_2}&amp;amp;=&amp;amp;\frac{T_1}{T_2}
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So a change of temperature from 70 F (294 K) down to 40 F (278 K) leads to a drop in football pressure from 27.7 psi down to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{27.7\,{\rm psi}}{P_2}&amp;amp;=&amp;amp;\frac{294 K}{278 K}\\\\
P_2&amp;amp;=&amp;amp; 26.2 \,{\rm psi}
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or a football pressure reading of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{equation}
26.2 \,{\rm psi}- 14.7 \,{\rm psi} = 11.5 \,{\rm psi}
\end{equation}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perfectly within the range of data that we have access to.  If the amount were much more (4 psi, for example) then we might get suspicious, but this does not seem to be the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="well-thats-nice-in-theory-but"&gt;Well, that's nice in theory, but...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, it seems to work in theory, but we should test it.  Well, &lt;a href="http://www.wcsh6.com/story/news/local/2015/01/22/deflategate-patriots-football-pressure-inflated/22174475/"&gt;someone has&lt;/a&gt;.  He inflated two balls to 13 psi, one in the room and one in the refrigerator.  It went down to 11.7 psi.  He added that someone falling on the ball could also make the ball lose air.  Nice and tidy.  Hearing this, my mind was instantly made up - unless someone can provide actual evidence to the contrary.  Was the interviewer convinced?  Nope - &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Ok, disclaimer time.  Yes, the professor is a Patriots fan, and these sound like a lot of excuses to let the Patriots off the hook.  But he says that this is real scientific stuff."  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it is - and it's not rocket science either.  It's not &lt;em&gt;"excuses"&lt;/em&gt;, it's the most plausible explanation until someone can actually provide evidence contrary to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-do-we-do-with-mundane-explanations"&gt;What do we do with mundane explanations?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have a mundane explanation, what do we do?  We need to require of any other explanation a much more rigourous and strong case - the evidence has to be much stronger than otherwise, because the mundane explanation has a very high prior probability.  Do we have that evidence?  Not that I've seen.  So, until someone shows me the video of a person letting out air from the football, or provides a credible witness, I'm chalking this one up to the typical hysteria Americans like in their news stories and go on with more important things.  Let's hope the NFL listens to the science, and does the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was a judge for a local science fair this past week, and found a number of projects lacking.  After thinking about it for a while, I realized that one of the problems seems to be the distinction (or, rather, lack of distinction) made between &lt;em&gt;demos&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;experiments&lt;/em&gt;.  In teaching science, especially in the younger grades, it seems common to say something like &lt;em&gt;"today we are going to do an experiment, mixing baking soda and vinegar"&lt;/em&gt;.  This, to me, is not an &lt;em&gt;experiment&lt;/em&gt;.  So, what do I think is the difference?  Here are a few thoughts.  Are there any more?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The outcome of an experiment is &lt;em&gt;unknown&lt;/em&gt;, whereas the outcome of a &lt;em&gt;demo&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;known&lt;/em&gt; - deliberately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In an experiments, the variables are &lt;em&gt;quantifiable&lt;/em&gt;, whereas the variables of a &lt;em&gt;demo&lt;/em&gt; are typically discrete and not quantitfiable.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In an experiment, the outcomes are also &lt;em&gt;quantifiable&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To continue with the example, the following &lt;em&gt;demos&lt;/em&gt; would be bad science fair topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what happens when we mix baking soda and vinegar?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;which produces more gas, baking soda and vinegar or baking power and vinegar?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make them true experiments, we could ask&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how does the amount of gas produced with baking soda and vinegar depend on the quantity of baking soda?  (both the amount of baking soda and the amount of gas are quantifiable)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to follow up, how does the amount of gas produced with baking &lt;em&gt;powder&lt;/em&gt; and vinegar depend on the quantity of baking &lt;em&gt;powder&lt;/em&gt;?  Is this the same as the dependence on baking &lt;em&gt;soda&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how many of the "experiments" shown in, for example, &lt;a href="http://www.education.com/science-fair/fifth-grade/"&gt;this science fair site&lt;/a&gt; are actual experiments?  The first few I checked did not meet the criteria above for experiment, but one could possibly modify them to do so.  However, without this guidance, the students are left with a sterile view of science.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>We should all be biased</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/we-should-all-be-biased.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-01-05T00:00:00-05:00</published><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2015-01-05:we-should-all-be-biased.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="images/capsule.png" width=200&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend and colleague of mine said to me recently that she was nervous that she might become "biased against any new health invention/method/etc... because virtually all of them have been ridiculous".  This is a feeling I've had from time to time, and I've heard it leveled against skeptics from the proponents of these new methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think, however, given the (lack of) performance of the bulk of these claims, ones prior probability - quite rationally - should be low for the next one.  It's not a bias to recognize that, all things being equal, the next silver bullet health claim is likely to be false.  It should, however, be very easy for a health treatment &lt;em&gt;that actually works&lt;/em&gt; to redeem itself above this prior probability.  The criticism of "bias" is raised only when the treatment hasn't actually been demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term bias is tricky depending on its usage. In many ways, bias is perfectly rational, if it means assuming something is false before the evidence.  Does one say that a jury is biased against the guilt of the suspect?   I think this sentence points to the fact that the word "bias" is typically used in a pejorative fashion, synonymous with being resistant to evidence.  Even here, resistant to evidence is rational to the extent that stronger evidence is needed to raise a lower prior probability.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps "bias" should mean willing to ignore some of the evidence against ones present view, in order to maintain this view.  This can come innocently in the form of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias"&gt;confirmation bias&lt;/a&gt;, and not be a deliberate distortion.  Clearly this violates the &lt;a href="http://oneecologistsview.blogspot.com/2012/06/basic-desirderata-jaynes.html"&gt;axioms of probability&lt;/a&gt;, and should be avoided.  Proper scientific thinking and process is constructed specifically to avoid this sort of bias, while at the same time supporting the rational forms of bias.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>LaTeX vs Word</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/latex-vs-word.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</published><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2014-12-31:latex-vs-word.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Reading &lt;a href="http://serialmentor.com/blog/2014/12/27/post-publication-review-of-the-plos-one-paper-comparing-ms-word-and-latex-how-not-to-compare-document-preparation"&gt;this review&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0115069"&gt;PloS One comparison&lt;/a&gt; between MS Word and &lt;a href="http://latex-project.org/ftp.html"&gt;LaTeX&lt;/a&gt;, I was struck by how much it resonates.  There are many things that I do in both (or, more precisely, in Pages rather than Word) depending on the application.  There are things that &lt;a href="http://latex-project.org/ftp.html"&gt;LaTeX&lt;/a&gt; can do much better than any other solution I have found, none of which is touched in the &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0115069"&gt;PloS One comparison&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, some things that could not be done in Word or Pages without a ton of work, are mentioned in &lt;a href="http://serialmentor.com/blog/2014/12/27/post-publication-review-of-the-plos-one-paper-comparing-ms-word-and-latex-how-not-to-compare-document-preparation"&gt;the review&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up 50 numbered equations, refer to them throughout the text, then change the equation order.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have figures and their captions float to appropriate locations at the top or bottom of pages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the order of figures in a document and fix all references to those figures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The referencing (figures, equations, and bibliography) is one of the strong points of &lt;a href="http://latex-project.org/ftp.html"&gt;LaTeX&lt;/a&gt;.  I see how much time my students spend on this in Word, and it completely erases the time-savings of Word.  I would add the following as well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Programatically change the content of the document - for example, I've had flags to change mathematical notation, and flags for the student vs teacher versions of a document&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easily generate &lt;a href="http://latex-project.org/ftp.html"&gt;LaTeX&lt;/a&gt; formatting from a script - I've written Python scripts to make tedious, large tables, and write them in &lt;a href="http://latex-project.org/ftp.html"&gt;LaTeX&lt;/a&gt; to be included in &lt;a href="http://web.bryant.edu/~bblais/statistical-inference-for-everyone-sie.html"&gt;my book&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organize multi-part documents, with references, into multiple files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Separate my thinking into separate content and layout modes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm the first to admit that the learning curve of &lt;a href="http://latex-project.org/ftp.html"&gt;LaTeX&lt;/a&gt; is pretty steep, but once you know it, it really offers advantages for &lt;em&gt;complex&lt;/em&gt; documents.  For simple ones, it doesn't stack up to an easier program, but isn't that the case with most powerful tools?  At that point, as &lt;a href="http://serialmentor.com/blog/2014/12/27/post-publication-review-of-the-plos-one-paper-comparing-ms-word-and-latex-how-not-to-compare-document-preparation"&gt;the review&lt;/a&gt; also suggests, it makes more sense to write things in &lt;a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax"&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt; - which this blog is written in.  So MS Word lands in that area of too-complex for simple documents and too-simple for complex documents.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>The Longest Night Ever</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/the-longest-night-ever.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-12-23T00:00:00-05:00</published><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2014-12-23:the-longest-night-ever.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently saw a claim that this past December 21 was the longest solstice night ever...in the history of the planet!  When I first heard this, and when I have told others, the first reaction is puzzlement - "why is this &lt;em&gt;particular&lt;/em&gt; Solstice special?", "how could it be that in the 4.5 billion years of the planet I would be here for this unique event?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, although unique, this is not an unusual event - the Earth is slowing down its spin, due to the interaction with the Moon.  Thus, each year, &lt;strong&gt;every day&lt;/strong&gt; is just a smidgen longer - about 20 millionths of a second each year.  So next year's Solstice will be the longest in the history of the planet as well, as was every Solstice in the past (at the time).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I find interesting is the habit of people to infer specialness so quickly when faced with a puzzle.  It is also interesting that once one understands the process, that specialness is immediately eliminated, and replaced with a more cosmic picture.  There is a direct parallel with all times in our history when we have (falsely) inferred the specialness of people - the heliocentric Universe, the distinction between humans and animals, Earthly vs Celestial material, organic vs inorganic life, etc...  This should serve as a reminder to us all to be skeptical of claims of specialness before understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the positive side, those people who keep wanting more hours in the day need only wait and it will happen automatically! &lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Why Python is the language everyone should learn</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/why-python-is-the-language-everyone-should-learn.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-12-15T00:00:00-05:00</published><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2014-12-15:why-python-is-the-language-everyone-should-learn.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have been a fan of the &lt;a href="http://www.python.org"&gt;Python programming language&lt;/a&gt; for many years.  It was encouraging to me lately that there are two articles about Python, reiterating many of my experiences, and teaching me some things I was unaware of.  The first, about &lt;a href="https://www.paypal-engineering.com/2014/12/10/10-myths-of-enterprise-python"&gt;myths about Python&lt;/a&gt; and its use in large-scale applications, was a real eye-opener.  I've never had to scale my apps up, or have high security, so I had implicitly bought into the two myths that Python was not suited for the job.  Nice to know I was wrong!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other, about someone's &lt;a href="http://allhailtothepenguin.blogspot.com/2014/12/after-years-of-c-and-java-i-chose-python.html"&gt;programming journey away from C and Java to Python&lt;/a&gt;, mirrored &lt;a href="http://web.bryant.edu/~bblais/bryant/numerical_computing/python_matlab.pdf"&gt;my own experience&lt;/a&gt; somewhat.  For me, it was coming off of Matlab, and finding that I could do all of what Matlab offered and much more.  At one time, I rewrote Matlab, Perl, Sed, Awk, and Jed scripts all in Python - being able to think in one language as opposed to five was a huge boon to productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my experience, Python is the easiest language for a beginner to learn, and it is one of the most powerful languages I've ever worked with.  I've been able to get a few of my colleagues hooked on Python over the years, and have yet to find a problem for which it is not well suited.  Even this website is written in Python!&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Evolution and Morality</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/evolution-and-morality.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-12-02T00:00:00-05:00</published><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2014-12-02:evolution-and-morality.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In an &lt;a href="http://web.bryant.edu/~bblais/objective-morality-defined.html#comment-1712880131"&gt;ongoing discussion about morality&lt;/a&gt;, I said &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is perfectly plausible to me that an evolutionary framework explains much of the process of getting our current moral intuitions, such as the close-kin bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of things I want to make plain from the outset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evolution is a &lt;em&gt;terrible&lt;/em&gt; guide for morality.  We don't derive our moral intuitions by looking at the process of evolution and using that to evaluate them.  We, and our moral intuitions, are the product of the process of evolution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can go beyond evolution in this, and in other, domains.  I hope to make this clear as we go on.  Let me explore an analogy which I think is helpful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id="vision-as-an-analogy-to-morality"&gt;Vision as an analogy to morality&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evolution has shaped our eyes, and the cognitive facilities that allow us to use them to build internal models of the world.  There is almost certainly an objective reality, although I cannot think of any experiment which could possibly confirm this.  It is possible that every persons' "&lt;em&gt;reality&lt;/em&gt;" is relative to them, but I don't find this either a useful or convincing perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even assuming an objective reality, our eyes do not give us a perfect rendition of it.  Perception is as much constructed from the brain as it is perceived.  Just because we can't "get outside" our own perceptions, this does not imply that we can't know anything about objective reality.  This also doesn't imply that our vision system doesn't give us a decent approximation to reality - it does give us a decent approximation, but like all approximations, there are limits. How do we get around those limits?  How do we surpass the limitations imposed by the evolutionary process on our vision to confirm the properties of objective reality?  The process of science!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use a process of verification by others, of repeatability, of open and honest discovery to distinguish what is true from what isn't.  We quantify the observations, we structure experiments, we explore our biases and design processes to reduce our sensitivity to them.  We recognize that evolution didn't care about perfect vision, only what was good enough.  We recognize that evolution is limited in terms of the solutions it can reach - full of jury-rigged partial solutions - which lead to things like the blind spot, and the brain processing to fill the spot in.  We recognize the situations where our vision is particularly limited - two dimensional environments, environments without clear objects for comparison, odd coincidences in object placement, etc...  In those cases we do not trust our visual intuitions, and lean on the more objective measures of scenes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="drawing-out-the-analogy"&gt;Drawing out the analogy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a cut-and-paste job.  What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evolution has shaped our moral intuitions, and the cognitive facilities that allow us to use them to build moral models of the world.  There is almost certainly an objective morality, although I cannot think of any experiment which could possibly confirm this.

&lt;p&gt;Even assuming an objective morality, our intuitions do not give us a perfect rendition of it.  Moral perception is as much constructed from the brain as it is perceived.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you say that you firmly believe in objective morality, do you mean objective relative to the human species, or in an absolute sense? And is your primary reason for this belief the difficulty we would otherwise have in holding people accountable?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quick answer is that it is not relative to the human species, and no it is not due to any difficulty holding people accountable otherwise.  The longer answer requires a bit more, and I think it useful to try to write down my thoughts on it.  Almost all of this idea is encapsulated in Sam Harris' view of the Moral Landscape, or Matt Dillahunty's view of Secular Morality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I can see it, all questions of morality have to deal with the well-being of conscious life.  John Figdor on the &lt;a href="http://www.spreaker.com/user/smalleyandhyso/154-atheist-vs-atheist-on-morals_1?utm_source=widget&amp;amp;utm_medium=widget"&gt;Dogma Debate episode&lt;/a&gt; which sparked this, seemed to contrast the notion of well-being with other metrics of morality such as Utilitarianism (i.e. the "greatest good for the greatest number"), Rawlsian "Veil of Ignorance", and Christian Fundamentalism.  However, what he didn't seem to realize, is that each of these is a &lt;em&gt;subset&lt;/em&gt; of well-being, and offer "rules of thumb" to trying to maximize it.  Even the Christian fundamentalist sees questions of morality, ultimately, in terms of well-being - just not in this life.  So I find it not a hard stretch to define morality in such terms.  If someone has a better usage, please have them put it up, but I haven't seen anything that isn't already part of the larger notion of well-being.  Further, every use of the term that I have ever seen matches the perspective of morality centered on the well-being of conscious life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you accept this, either as a given or at least for the sake of argument, then the objectivity of morality naturally comes from the truth that the facts about well-being must derive from the facts of the universe - there must be right and wrong answers to questions about what will maximize well-being, whether we are able to access it perfectly or not.  I do not think that the math of well-being is easy, nor is it linear, but I think one can come to some decent approximations.  Slavery (i.e. owning other people as property) can be shown, objectively, to decrease well-being on many fronts.  It is then quite likely that this is a moral absolute, although I could imagine someone coming up in the future with a derivation that shows that slavery is in fact better for well-being - but I doubt it.  In the sciences, all conclusions are tentative, and the conclusions about slavery may be much like the conclusion that the Earth goes around the Sun and not vice versa.  Sure, it's tentative, but I can't imagine it ever being overturned, and it would be perverse to think otherwise.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some moral questions, however, may be more like what happens sometimes in medicine where one may find something commonly thought of as good for you to turn out not to be.  This doesn't negate the fact that there are, objectively, things that are good for you and things that are bad for you.  It just speaks to our ability to know such things well, poorly, or approximately.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the real benefit, however, in thinking in these terms is that it structures the discussion.  Any discussion about the moral rightness of a position such as pro-choice, anti-gay marriage, anti-war, etc... must be framed in terms of well-being.  When it isn't then it is divorced from the real consequences of those positions, and can lead to real harm.  The problem with the religious discourse on these issues is not necessarily that they are wrong, but it is that their positions are disconnected from the real consequences of those positions.  Or, perhaps, they are framed in terms of well-being but they make use of well-being in an afterlife, which they fail to be able to demonstrate actually exists -  amounting to the same problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secular progress in moral domains occurs when there is a reasoned discussion, always focusing on the well-being of conscious life.  &lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Objective Morality</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/objective-morality.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-11-21T00:00:00-05:00</published><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2014-11-21:objective-morality.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In a recent &lt;a href="http://www.spreaker.com/user/smalleyandhyso/154-atheist-vs-atheist-on-morals_1?utm_source=widget&amp;amp;utm_medium=widget"&gt;Dogma Debate Episode&lt;/a&gt;, we have a debate between the position of objective morality as espoused by Matt Dillahunty and subjective morality as espoused by John Figdor.  I firmly believe in objective morality, and thought Matt did an ok job, but I disliked the directions the conversation took most of the time.  The biggest problem I saw with John's argument was that he said that there is a &lt;em&gt;fundamental&lt;/em&gt; difference between social sciences and physical sciences, and that knowledge in latter can be considered "objective".  He then argued that questions of morality are more like the former, and can only be discussed subjectively.  He argued that we can't get outside of our biases and opinions to be objective about questions of morality, and thus it is the result of opinion.  He contrasted it to the objective engineering reality that a spring has a finite, measurable, and specific breaking point - which can be written in pounds or some other force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue is a matter of complexity.  There is no &lt;em&gt;fundamental&lt;/em&gt; difference between sociology, economics, and physics.  Different methods are needed because the level of complexity, levels of uncertainty, and the limits of our techniques dictate this.  Although moral questions are complex, and challenging, that morality has to do with the well-being of conscious creatures is true by definition.  As such, all such questions connect to the real world, and have real-world consequences, and we can have knowledge of these moral facts as we have knowledge in any domain of rationality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even something as direct as the breaking point of a spring has more complexity than John is willing to admit.  It is not a single number, but depends on temperature, the history of the spring, and other things.  These are things that one can possibly quantify, but there are complexities still not entirely understood.  Moral questions may suffer from the same uncertainties as even the least quantitative social sciences, it doesn't change the fact that there are objective moral facts in principle.  The problem with John's position, as I see it, is that he can never possibly say another moral viewpoint is wrong - even the most horrendous acts.  These other viewpoints are just unfashionable.  Such thinking is dangerous, I believe, and leads to a kind of moral paralysis.  &lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Something from Nothing</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/something-from-nothing.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-10-28T00:00:00-04:00</published><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2014-10-28:something-from-nothing.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="nothing" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/CMB_Timeline300_no_WMAP.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a talk about &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EilZ4VY5Vs"&gt;something from nothing&lt;/a&gt;, Lawrence Krauss describes how physics addresses the concept of "nothing".  He has been criticized &lt;a href="http://www.bethinking.org/is-there-a-creator/a-universe-from-someone-against-lawrence-krauss"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.reasonablefaith.org/a-universe-from-nothing"&gt;again here&lt;/a&gt;, primarily for redefining "nothing" in a way that the philosophers don't consider as nothing.  Essentially, philosophers want to say that "nothing" is without properties or process, and that Krauss' physics-based "nothing" has properties.  Thus the apologists claim that the universe cannot come from "nothing", that there must be a creator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was thinking about this today.  One response is that no one has demonstrated that the philosophical notion of "nothing" is at all possible - there may not be a way for there to be "nothing".  One also hasn't demonstrated that the universe itself couldn't have always existed, or perhaps the laws have always existed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even granting all of that, the creation of the universe from "nothing" by the creator is not even a creation from "nothing" - the creator has to be there first, and the creator has properties, and is presumed to be eternal.  Thus the philosophers and apologists who claim that the creator made the universe "ex nihilo" are really claiming nothing of the sort.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>What is AI?</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/what-is-ai.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-10-14T00:00:00-04:00</published><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2014-10-14:what-is-ai.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In his blog post, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2014/09/11/chatbots-are-boring-they-arent-ai/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chatbots are boring. They aren't AI.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, PZ Myers the professor of biology at the University of Minnesota Morris has this to say about chatbots and AI:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chatbots are kind of the lowest of the low, the over-hyped fruit decaying at the base of the tree. They aren’t even particularly interesting. What you’ve got is basically a program that tries to parse spoken language, and then picks lines from a script that sort of correspond to whatever the interlocutor is talking about. There is no inner dialog in the machine, no ‘thinking’, just regurgitations of scripted output in response to the provocation of language input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then goes on to say what should work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programming in associations is not how consciousness is going to arise. What you need to work on is a general mechanism for making associations and rules. The model has to be something like a baby. Have you noticed that babies do not immediately start parroting their parents’ speech and reciting grammatically correct sentences? They flail about, they’re surprised when they bump some object and it moves, they notice that suckling makes their tummy full, and they begin to construct mental models about how the world works. I’ll be impressed when an AI is given no pre-programmed knowledge of language at all, and begins with baby-talk babbling and progresses over months or years to construct its own competence in comprehending speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He may be justified in complaining about overzealous claims from some researchers, but he is dead wrong about what AI is, what it takes to be considered AI, and his criterion for accepting an intelligent machine.  He's even wrong about the biology, which is somewhat surprising given his field.  Let's have a look at this more closely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-is-ai"&gt;What is AI?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, the field of AI, can be summarized as the production of machines that do things that typically only humans have done in the past.  It says nothing about the &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; that those machine solve those problems.  The chess-playing tour-de-force, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_(chess_computer)"&gt;Deep Blue&lt;/a&gt;, defeated the best human at chess - a game that at one time was a symbol of human intellect - not by playing like the grandmaster, but by being a really fast, stupid machine.  It examined trillions of ridiculous options that the grandmaster never even considered, to cull from those trillions the one or two good moves.  Was there any "inner dialog in the machine" or "thinking"?  Not at all.  Was it AI?  Of course it was.  It was a machine solving a problem that was, before that point, limited to humans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-is-intelligence"&gt;What is Intelligence?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps PZ Myers is complaining that these machine aren't intelligent, like humans are, and I'd agree that we are a long way from the sorts of machines that rival humans in some domains.  However, I am not sure that when he uses the term &lt;em&gt;intelligence&lt;/em&gt; that he is considering a well-defined quantity.  Like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room"&gt;Searle's Chinese Room&lt;/a&gt;, how do we know that there is a 'dialog in the machine' even inside of a human?  How do we know that we are not simply picking "lines from a script", albeit a fairly complex script?  I'm not sure we do, so the critique to me seems a bit vacuous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pre-programmed"&gt;Pre-programmed?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll be impressed when an AI is given no pre-programmed knowledge of language at all, and begins with baby-talk babbling and progresses over months or years to construct its own competence in comprehending speech&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This line baffled me - does PZ Myers believe that a human baby has &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; pre-programming for language?  That the baby is a complete blank slate?  Evolution has clearly pre-programmed us for abilities in general language acquisition, so even babies are not a blank slate.  His challenge then, for AI, would rule out humans as well!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, much of the recent &lt;a href="http://deeplearning.net/"&gt;Deep Learning research&lt;/a&gt; is essentially what PZ is wishing for (although not in the domain of language, that I have read).  Here, artificial networks start with random starting conditions and learn patterns from the data, to achieve sophisticated inference in complex domains.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may be premature to claim that we are on the verge of creating artificial consciousness, but the naive responses such as those exemplified by PZ Myers here do not reflect the reality of AI research.  Ironically, it smacks of the same tone creationists take to try to keep humans special at all costs, a tone that I am sure PZ Myers would not appreciate being attributed to him.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Naturalism of the Gaps?</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/naturalism-of-the-gaps.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-09-30T00:00:00-04:00</published><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2014-09-30:naturalism-of-the-gaps.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="naturalism" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/Fallen_Monarchs_1886_by_William_Bliss_Baker.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heard a term yesterday that I hadn't every heard before, while listening to a very interesting interview/debate with &lt;a href="http://commonsenseatheism.com/?p=261"&gt;Mike Licona on the Resurrection&lt;/a&gt;.  The term is "naturalism of the gaps", as a parallel (and supposedly equally flawed) argument to the "god of the gaps".  In a nutshell, it refers to those people who claim that someday there will be a natural explanation for a particular problem currently not understood (e.g. consciousness, origin of life, origin of the universe, etc...)  As &lt;a href="http://www.reasons.org/articles/god-of-the-gaps-or-best-explanation"&gt;one apologetic website puts it&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet it is important to notice how entrenched naturalists are to their mindset and worldview. When it comes to science, only physical and material explanations are allowable (called methodological naturalism)–the supernatural is ruled out a priori (without examination). Also, some naturalists express excessive confidence that the future will explain reality. But they don't live in the future and it is illegitimate to appeal to the expected explanations of the future to explain present reality (what is needed is evidence in the present). This faulty form of reasoning constitutes the argumentum ad futuris fallacy ("accept this because future evidence will support it"). Ironically it might even be called "naturalism-of-the-gaps" reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two very straightforward responses to this kind of reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methodological naturalism&lt;/em&gt; is the only choice we have available, because no one has demonstrated any procedure to distinguish supernatural claims.  Thus, if we are in the business of distinguishing claims, we are left as a matter of practicality with the only option that does not address supernaturalism at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To assume a naturalistic explanation in the future is simply the recognition that in &lt;em&gt;every single case&lt;/em&gt; where we have finally understood a topic, the best explanation has &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; turned out to be supernatural...&lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt;.  There are literally millions of cases going the other direction, where a supernatural agent was used to explain something and a natural explanation supplanted the supernatural explanation.  This happened with lightning, seasons, the sun moving in the sky, the planets moving in the sky, earthquakes, disease, etc....&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To bet on naturalism is simply to recognize this historical pattern, and to put your money down on the only horse that has ever won in this race against the horse that has always lost in this race.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On which horse would you put your money?&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Three Years of Weather</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/three-years-of-weather.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-09-23T00:00:00-04:00</published><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2014-09-23:three-years-of-weather.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="surface map" src="http://weather.unisys.com/archive/sfc_map/1210/12103000.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

These surface maps are archived at the &lt;a href="http://weather.unisys.com/archive/"&gt;Unisys Weather Image Archive&lt;/a&gt;, and are generated every 12 hours.  It's pretty cool to see the pattern of the weather sweeping across the US, and noting certain memorable storms.  Hurricane Sandy, for example, shows up at the end of October 2012 and you see the other front crossing the US at the same time, meeting Sandy on the East Coast.&lt;/p&gt;

How could harm come from a treatment that, even if false, doesn't do anything?  Well, we have an example in the recent news of the ebola outbreak.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hear that the outbreak in Sierra Leone, with the death toll in the hundreds now, was started by an herbalist claiming cures of ebola that were unfounded.  No more can one honestly claim that no harm is done by alternative medicine.  It's just too bad it takes such a tragedy for some to come to this realization.  For others, this may not even be enough.&lt;/p&gt;

It got me thinking about the cases where I may have changed my mind due to evidence, and what evidence would convince me of various claims.  This leads inexorably to the processes of science.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawrence Krauss flippantly said that if the stars in the sky reorganize and spelled out the words of the Bible it would get him to start considering it (however, upon reflection, one might want to consider delusion at that point).  Believers talk about, if the bones of Jesus were found that would do it...however, is that even reasonable to expect under any circumstances?  It's a lot simpler than that, than trying to find nearly impossible data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we insert any kind of scientific claim, like "what evidence would convince me of [the Sun orbiting the Earth], [evolution], [evolution is false], etc...", we can start to see part of the problem.  It's not a matter of new evidence, it is a matter of explaining the existing evidence...and then some.  In order to convince me that evolution by natural selection is false, you have to come up with an explanation that does as well explaining all the existing data (e.g. geographic organization of animals, embryology, genetic relationships, vestigial features, etc...) as well as find a domain which cannot be explained by evolution by natural selection.  Apologists often focus on the latter, pointing out supposed flaws or gaps in our understanding, but that is not nearly enough.  The gaps are either things we already understand with this theory (e.g. intermediate forms), or are not addressed by this theory (e.g. origin of life), or are details that don't change the overall picture (e.g. punctuated equilibrium).  Even if true gaps were found, to mount an actual overthrow of evolution by natural selection, you have to put forward a useful explanation that works for all of the cases natural selection works for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we can think of Newton's laws.  What evidence would it take for me not to believe in Newton's Law of Gravity?  Pretty much nothing at this point, even though I know there is a correction with Einstein's equations - Newton's laws work so well, that it is very nearly the truth even &lt;em&gt;given&lt;/em&gt; its limitations.  All of the evidence for Newton's Law of Gravity is still around, and isn't changing, and any replacement has to address that (which Einstein's equations do).  This is why science gets progressively harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, with the evidence for God, any explanation has to deal with the fact that the various direct predictions from, say, Christianity have been systematically undermined by science.  Mental disease caused by spirits?  World created in the order (orders?) specified in Genesis?  End of the world coming before 100AD?  Prayer is a direct, and effective, method for healing?  People are actually spoken to by spirits/God?  God designed the diversity of life on the planet?  There was a global flood in the past 10,000 years?  These are topics, directly supported in the Bible, and refuted by science.  The only way modern Christians deal with them is to either say the science is wrong (which it isn't) or to ignore those inconvenient parts of the Bible as "metaphor".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the evidence for a flat Earth, or the heliocentric solar system, the evidence for Christianity is a tale of an ever increasing list of refuted claims, until all we are left with are claims about the fringes of our understanding and a possible deist agent out there...somewhere.  Any theist explanation must first to be able to contend with this mountain of negative evidence before it can get off the ground.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would convince me of the truth of Christianity?  I don't need the stars reorganized, or a big booming voice from the sky.  If &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; of the direct claims of Christianity were to be demonstrated as true, then I'd be willing to begin to consider it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>What Sane Climate Discussion Looks Like</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/what-sane-climate-discussion-looks-like.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-08-05T00:00:00-04:00</published><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2014-08-05:what-sane-climate-discussion-looks-like.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="bear" src="images/Ursus_maritimus_mother_with_cub.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the standard climate blogs I read is &lt;a href="http://judithcurry.com/"&gt;Judith Curry's blog Climate Etc...&lt;/a&gt;  I find that the topics she brings up, and the points she adds to it, are always very engaging and even-handed, without the usual alarmism.  For example, here is a &lt;a href="http://judithcurry.com/2014/07/30/lomborgs-senate-testimony/"&gt;summary of Bjorn Lomborg's Senate testimony&lt;/a&gt;, all points perfectly reasonable, as far as I can see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From his estimates, "The cost of inaction by the end of the century is equivalent to an annual loss of GDP growth on the order of 0.02%....equivalent to losing one year’s growth, or a moderate, one year recession." while "policy action as opposed to inaction, also has costs, and will still incur a significant part of the climate damage." and incur (optimistically) a cost of "1.5% of GDP by the end of the century." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, he addresses certain specific policies, like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solar   and   wind   power   was   subsidized   by   \&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(60   billion   in   2012,  
despite   their     paltry   climate   benefit   of   \\)&lt;/span&gt;1.4   billion. &lt;br /&gt;
Essentially,   $58.6   billion   were   wasted.   Depending   on   political &lt;br /&gt;
viewpoint,   that   money   could   have   been   used   to   get   better &lt;br /&gt;
health   care,   more   teachers,   better   roads,   or   lower   taxes. &lt;br /&gt;
Moreover, forcing   everyone   to   buy   more   expensive,   less   reliable &lt;br /&gt;
energy   pushes   higher   costs   throughout   the   economy,   leaving   less &lt;br /&gt;
for   welfare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find, nearly universally, that people who espouse strong environmental policies never look at the &lt;em&gt;benefits&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;em&gt;not doing&lt;/em&gt; those policies - they focus entirely on one side of the economics.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I like the metaphor that he brought in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The   metaphor   here   is   the   computer   in   the   1950s.   We   did &lt;br /&gt;
not   obtain   better   computers   by   mass producing   them   to   get &lt;br /&gt;
cheaper   vacuum   tubes.   We   did   not   provide   heavy   subsidies   so &lt;br /&gt;
that   every   Westerner   could   have   one   in   their   home   in   1960. &lt;br /&gt;
Nor   did   we   tax   alternatives   like   typewriters.   The   breakthroughs &lt;br /&gt;
were   achieved   by   a   dramatic   ramping   up   of   R&amp;amp;D,   leading   to &lt;br /&gt;
multiple   innovations,   which   enabled   companies   like   IBM   and &lt;br /&gt;
Apple   to   eventually   produce   computers   that   consumers   wanted   to &lt;br /&gt;
buy.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems to me to be a rational way to discuss these topics.&lt;/p&gt;

The &lt;a href="http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2014/06/12/frequentism-and-bayesianism-3-confidence-credibility/"&gt;third part&lt;/a&gt;, in my opinion, is the clearest example of the differences in the approaches, demonstrating the superiority of the Bayesian approach, and why frequentist statistics is wrong in science.

&lt;p&gt;After presenting this "argument", he claims that he doubts that Matt will challenge the first premise, and he was correct.  I, however, challenge the first premise - it is not always reasonable to believe in true things.  For something to be &lt;em&gt;reasonable&lt;/em&gt;, it must mean that you have followed the proper procedures of inductive reasoning, or in other words, are applying probability theory properly.  This means that the confidence in a claim must scale with the available evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For it to be &lt;em&gt;reasonable to believe in something&lt;/em&gt;, it must rise to a level of probability that you would label it as "belief".  Does this ever happen, or should this ever happen, with untrue things?  Certainly.  Here are a few that come to mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the world is flat - as long as you are constrained to not live near the shore, or see a lunar eclipse&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;life is designed - before the advent of Darwin's theory of natural selection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Sun, and the stars, all go around the Earth - until the advent of physics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each of these cases there is in fact strong evidence for the claims, and against the counter claims, to make it reasonable to believe them (at the time).  It no longer is reasonable - the process of reason forces one to re-weight the probabilities of the hypotheses given new evidence, and to discard those hypotheses that become too improbable.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd like to see Sye to define reason.  Even if we assume his God is real, the process of God-given reason needs to be consistent with what we already establish for inductive reason.  There is no spot in it for special pleading, so it would undermine the thing he is claiming.  For example, proper reasoning concludes that special revelation is not reliable, and thus cannot be used as strong evidence for adjusting probabilities.  If Sye is making the claim that even using logic presupposes God, he needs to define reason in such a way that it doesn't turn back on his presupposition.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, he won't, because all presuppositionalist arguments are circular.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Free, or Not-So-Free, Will</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/free-or-not-so-free-will.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-06-04T00:00:00-04:00</published><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2014-06-04:free-or-not-so-free-will.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I felt compelled to write this post, for some reason.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading an interesting &lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2013/09/free_will_debate_what_does_free_will_mean_and_how_did_it_evolve.html"&gt;article about free will&lt;/a&gt; has gotten me thinking about it again, despite the fact that doing so makes my head hurt a bit.  It is easy to go in circles with this.  I have given my &lt;a href="http://web.bryant.edu/~bblais/free-will-and-entropy.html"&gt;initial perspective elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;, and this article doesn't really sway me from that.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roy Baumeister in the above article states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These arguments leave untouched the meaning of free will that most people understand, which is consciously making choices about what to do in the absence of external coercion, and accepting responsibility for one’s actions. Hardly anyone denies that people engage in logical reasoning and self-control to make choices. There is a genuine psychological reality behind the idea of free will. The debate is merely about whether this reality deserves to be called free will. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no need to insist that free will is some kind of magical violation of causality. Free will is just another kind of cause. The causal process by which a person decides whether to marry is simply different from the processes that cause balls to roll downhill, ice to melt in the hot sun, a magnet to attract nails, or a stock price to rise and fall.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He states this with no support whatsoever.  He presents some analogies, like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No number of facts about a carbon atom can explain life, let alone the meaning of your life. These causes operate at different levels of organization. Even if you could write a history of the Civil War purely in terms of muscle movements or nerve cell firings, that (very long and dull) book would completely miss the point of the war. Free will cannot violate the laws of physics or even neuroscience, but it invokes causes that go beyond them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is true that we don't typically describe things like the Civil War in terms of the underlying physics, but that is a &lt;em&gt;practical&lt;/em&gt; limitation of human knowledge.  If we had infinite faculties for such descriptions, then one &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; even get the "point of the war" from the "muscle movements or nerve cell firings".  In just the same way that we use the concept of entropy when we cannot specify the locations and speeds of all of the molecules of air in the room, we use the concept of free will to summarize and label our ignorance.  It becomes real, as entropy is real, but doesn't mitigate the ultimate determinism of the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, he gets to the topic of agency with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evolution of free will began when living things began to make choices. The difference between plants and animals illustrates an important early step. Plants don’t change their location and don’t need brains to help them decide where to go. Animals do. Free will is an advanced form of the simple process of controlling oneself, called agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, when a flower opens in the day and closes a night, or even &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8mr0R3ibPU"&gt;follows the sun&lt;/a&gt;, how is that different than the animal "choosing" to run toward rewards and away from punishments?  It isn't different, except in complexity, but complexity alone does not elliminate fundamental determinism or produce freedom.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>A Good Bet Lost</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/a-good-bet-lost.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-05-29T00:00:00-04:00</published><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2014-05-29:a-good-bet-lost.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="clock" src="images/clock_small.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I was sitting in the cafeteria the other day, and there was a clock which showed the wrong time and the second hand was being weird.  I noted that the second hand was broken, and not advancing properly, and a student of mine said "No, the second hand is just advancing two seconds at a time, but it counting out the correct time."  I looked briefly again, and it didn't seem that way, so I bet $1 (my highest bet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enthusiastically, we sat there for a minute or so, independently timing the clock and it turned out she was right and I was wrong.  I happily handed over the $1, and was glad to know one fewer wrong thing in the universe.  That is the attitude that we need to instill in our students, and in the public.  Here are a few attitudes that we need to encourage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it is good to be shown to be wrong, and one should be happy when it happens&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it is good to update ones belief based on the evidence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it is good to actively look for ways to challenge your beliefs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it is good to put your money where your mouth is&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If more of our politicians had this scientific attitude, the world would be a better place.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Supporting Dualism</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/supporting-dualism.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-05-16T00:00:00-04:00</published><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2014-05-16:supporting-dualism.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/h0YtL5eiBYw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just finished listening to this excellent debate.  I thought the proponents of dualism were credulous, and ignored the specific requests by the opponents to rule out alternatives.  I'll get into that in another post, but I had to respond to this one point immediately, because it is so easy to confirm that it jumped out at me.  At &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0YtL5eiBYw&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=1h26m29s"&gt;time point 1h26m29s&lt;/a&gt; we have the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eben Alexander:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very renowned skeptic and scientist Carl Sagan admitted that past-life memories in children, the evidence for that is overwhelming.  He said that in his book, the Demon Haunted World, on page 302, he says &lt;strong&gt;exactly that&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;em&gt;(emphasis original)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Novella:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've read that book 100 times, Carl Sagan did not believe in past lives, he did not believe in anything paranormal or supernatural, that is &lt;strong&gt;just not true&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;em&gt;(emphasis original)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that I have that book on my bookshelf, and so it was an easy matter to check this claim.  Here is the quote of the entire paragraph referenced from the Demon Haunted World, page 302, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps one percent of the time, someone who has an idea that smells, feels, and looks indistinguishable from the usual run of pseudoscience will turn out to be right.  Maybe some undiscovered reptile left over from the Cretaceous period will indeed be found in Loch Ness or the Congo Republic; or we will find artifacts of an advanced, non-human species elsewhere in the Solar System.  At the time of writing there are three claims in the ESP field which, in my opinion, deserve serious study: (1) that by thought alone humans can (barely) affect random number generators in computers; (2) that people under mild sensory deprivation can receive thoughts or images "projected" at them; and (3) that young children sometimes report the details of a previous life, which upon checking turn out to be accurate and which they could not have known about in any other way than reincarnation.  I pick these claims not because I think they're likely to be valid (I don't), but as examples of contentions that &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be true.  The last three have at least some, although still dubious, experimental support.  Of course, I could be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is very hard to imagine someone misreading this into thinking that Carl Sagan either believes these claims, or is claiming that they have overwhelming scientific support, given that he directly says he doesn't believe the claims and that the evidence is dubious!.  I can see only two alternatives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the person making the claim doesn't expect anyone to check, and knows better - they are lying.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the person actually believes that Sagan had this stance, from reading this paragraph - they have misread it so profoundly, it defies explanation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recognize that it is nearly impossible to determine whether someone is lying, but this claim stands out as such a distortion it is hard to imagine under what circumstances an intelligent person could unknowingly make this claim, or even convince themselves that the claim is true.  Perhaps they didn't read it, or stopped at the list of things that Sagan said "deserves serious study" and misread that as an endorsement?  Given how specific this is, it is also hard to imagine that Eben Alexander hasn't used this argument before, in which case someone must have tried to correct him on it.  If not, he needs to read this blog!  If so, and he persists in this quote, then the distortion is almost certainly deliberate.  Every way I try to wrap my brain around this exchange, I am perplexed and dismayed.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Siblings and Astronomy</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/siblings-and-astronomy.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-05-14T00:00:00-04:00</published><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2014-05-14:siblings-and-astronomy.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Sun" src="images/Sun.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a "science is darn cool" note, the sibling of the Sun &lt;a href="http://time.com/95587/astronomers-find-a-sibling-star-to-the-sun/"&gt;has been found&lt;/a&gt;.  It's a pretty straightforward idea, although technically challenging.  Stars that are "born" from the same gas cloud will carry the same quantities of some rare elements, which can be used a a family signature.  It's a direct confirmation of a long-standing theory of stellar formation, and totally cool.  I'm reminded of a comment Richard Feynman made, which said that science adds to the appreciation of things that are available to everyone.  Looking up at the stars, the scientist doesn't just see points of light against a dark background, but sees pieces of a long story, of which we are all a part.  &lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Spurious Correlations</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/spurious-correlations.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-05-12T00:00:00-04:00</published><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2014-05-12:spurious-correlations.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" src="http://i.imgur.com/VSKqqzC.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw this list of &lt;a href="http://www.tylervigen.com/"&gt;spurious correlations&lt;/a&gt;, including "US spending on science, space, and technology"  correlates with "Suicides by hanging, strangulation and suffocation", "Number people who drowned by falling into a swimming-pool" correlates with "Number of films Nicolas Cage appeared in" and "Per capita consumption of cheese (US)" correlates with "Number of people who died by becoming tangled in their bedsheets".  These aren't spurious correlations, actually, they are spurious &lt;em&gt;causations&lt;/em&gt;.  The correlation is real, it's just that there isn't a cause-and-effect relationship (in either direction) - there is some third variable (or variables) influencing both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love showing these sorts of examples to student to talk about correlations and causation.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of these are just correlated by trends - up or down for the entire timeframe, where it is clear what the third variable is - population growth, for example. A couple of them, like "Worldwide non-commercial space launches correlates with Sociology doctorates awarded (US)" and "Age of Miss America correlates with Murders by steam, hot vapours and hot objects" have interesting oscillations that are not obvious.  There is almost certainly a third variable there...otherwise there is some space-tech training in sociology that I am unaware of.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>"Skeptics" vs "Realists"</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/skeptics-vs-realists.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-05-08T00:00:00-04:00</published><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2014-05-08:skeptics-vs-realists.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Skeptics vs Realists" src="http://www.skepticalscience.com/graphics/Escalator_2012_500.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above graphic has circulated the internet for a while, and I think it worthy of comment.  The &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; of the graphic is to point out how &lt;a href="http://www.skepticalscience.com/graphics.php?g=47"&gt;silly those so-called global warming "skeptics" are&lt;/a&gt;.  However, I think there is a hidden proposal there as well, worthy of an undergraduate project.  If we call the "skeptics" model &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(M_S\)&lt;/span&gt; and the "realists" model &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(M_R\)&lt;/span&gt;, then we want the following probabilities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
P(M_S|{\rm data})
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
P(M_R|{\rm data})
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
where the data is the temperature data for the past 40 years (or farther, if you want to compare to the entire known &lt;a href="http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/"&gt;global temperature record&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason that we consider the "skeptics" model as potentially silly is the direct consequence of the probability analysis.  The "realist" model has two parameters, so when we calculate the model probability we marginalize over those parameters.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
P(M_R|{\rm data})= \int_{\alpha,\beta} P(M_R|{\rm data},\alpha,\beta)P(\alpha,\beta)
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
where &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\alpha\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\beta\)&lt;/span&gt; are the slope and intercept of the linear model, respectively.  We incur an &lt;a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~mackay/itprnn/ps/345.357.pdf"&gt;Ockham penalty&lt;/a&gt; for each marginalized parameter.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we look at the "skeptics" model, we have the same.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
P(M_S|{\rm data})= \int_{\alpha_1,\beta_1,\alpha_2,\beta_2,\cdots,t_1,t_2,\cdots} P(M_S|{\rm data},\alpha_1,\beta_1,\alpha_2,\beta_2,\cdots,t_1,t_2,\cdots)P(\alpha_1,\beta_1,\alpha_2,\beta_2,\cdots,t_1,t_2,\cdots)
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
where &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\alpha_1\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\beta_1\)&lt;/span&gt; are the slope and intercept, respectively, of the first line up to year &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(t_1\)&lt;/span&gt;.  &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\alpha_2\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\beta_2\)&lt;/span&gt; are the slope and intercept, respectively, of the &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; line up to year &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(t_2\)&lt;/span&gt;, etc....  Since we incur an &lt;a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~mackay/itprnn/ps/345.357.pdf"&gt;Ockham penalty&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;each&lt;/em&gt; marginalized parameter, this model needs to fit the data substantially better than the "realist" model to achieve the same level of probability.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does &lt;em&gt;substantially&lt;/em&gt; mean?  That is the proposal - perhaps someone will do this proper probabilistic analysis of the problem.  Maybe the "skeptics" will turn out correct!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was reading an &lt;a href="http://siftingreality.com/2014/04/24/if-the-mind-and-brain-are-not-identical-naturalism-is-false/"&gt;article about dualism&lt;/a&gt; where they point out 6 reasons that naturalism is false and that dualism must be true, as evidenced by properties of the mind and brain.  It makes sense to respond to each of the claims in turn, and to focus on how we know what we know, how we can demonstrate dualism or not, and where to go from here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) First-person access to mental properties&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This concept of your dream car is not something that people can see by looking at your brain structure. 
Physical properties can be physically accessed, but the properties of your dream car and privately accessed"{.theist}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we are a bit far from publicly accessing as complex an object as a car, we can actually access brain states with various types of imaging and reconstruction.  One interesting one is a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbTf2nE3Lbw"&gt;reconstruction of concepts via fMRI&lt;/a&gt; by Tom Mitchell.  Another is a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsjDnYxJ0bo"&gt;movie reconstruction from brain activity&lt;/a&gt; by Jack Gallant.  Both of these demonstrate that what was once privately held experiences can be publicly accessed as activity patterns in the brain.  Note this is not "looking at your brain structure", it is looking at the &lt;em&gt;process&lt;/em&gt; of the brain.  Thus, the sorts of dichotomies present in this article between the mind and the &lt;em&gt;structure&lt;/em&gt; of the brain are all strawmen.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Our experience of consciousness implies that we are not our bodies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Common sense notion of personhood is that we own our bodies, but we are not our bodies"{.theist}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first reaction with this is to think:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Common sense notion of the world is that it is flat, and unmoving"{.atheist}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since when do we use &lt;em&gt;common sense&lt;/em&gt; to determine truth?  It might be an initial guide, but our experience with relativity and quantum mechanics should immediately make one wary about using common sense as the sole method for determining the truth of a claim.  It is true that we have a label, we call "I" or "self" which seems separate from the body, but that is no argument that they are &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; separate.  It is easy to see that this label is not the entire picture, where we can push the boundaries.  For example, the &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; bacteria in our gut we often think of as separate from ourselves, and yet we cannot live without it, and the distinction between these beings and ourselves is &lt;a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-neuroscience-of-gut/"&gt;quite a bit blurred&lt;/a&gt;.  What about the mitochondria in our cells?  Are the separate from you?  Are they not?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a common pattern that, for any complex system, sharp distinctions are are rare.  Animate vs inanimate, quantum systems vs classical, etc...  To base ones objection to an idea because it isn't black and white is, frankly, childish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) Persistent self-identity through time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"When you change even the smallest part of a physical object, it changes the identity of that object.  Every cell in your body is different from the body you had 10 years ago. If you are the same person you were 10 years ago, then you are not your physical body" {.theist}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as your tire tread wears down from your car, it ceases to be your car?  When your mechanic changes the spark plugs, it is no longer your car?  "Your car" is the convenient label we give an object that has some form of permanence, whether it be a permanence of form or function.  The label obviously has some limits as a result.  Swapping every piece of one car with another, even if done gradually, may in fact change its identity (i.e. label) or is might not - depends on whether the label itself is useful.  We aren't talking about some Platonic pure forms here, or a pre-scientific &lt;em&gt;essence&lt;/em&gt;, neither of which are demonstrable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an amoeba splits, what about the identities of the resulting two?  Is one of them the same original amoeba?  Both of them?  Neither (in which case the original one is simply gone)?  Perhaps the simplistic picture of identity being used here is just not useful.  The words may in fact not have any meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the label that we ascribe to "self" is perfectly fine 10 years later, despite the changes in cells, because there is some permanence of form and function.  Each new brain cell, for example, fills the shoes of the ones that went before in much the same way that factory workers take shifts - the process continues, even if the components change over time.  If the mind is the &lt;em&gt;process&lt;/em&gt; of the brain, as stated before, then this is no problem. If the label "self" leads to contradictions when pushed too far, then perhaps the label or the way we imagine the label being used is no longer appropriate in those situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4) Mental properties cannot be measured like physical objects&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Physical objects can be measured (e.g. – use physical measurements to measure weight, size, etc.).
Mental properties cannot be measured. {.theist}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stated without support, and contradicted by the evidence above for (1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5) Intentionality or About-ness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Mental entities can refer to realities that are physical, something outside of themselves. A tree is not about anything, it just is a physical object. But you can have thoughts about the tree out there in the garden that needs water."{.theist}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure if this statement is even defined - what does it mean to be "about" something, such that a physical object can't be "about" something.  Mental states, as represented by brain activity, are correlated with physical reality, can have representations of that reality (mental models) which are essentially a form of correlated activity, so in that sense mental states can be about physical reality.  Of course there can be limited examples of this sort of correlation on a much simpler level.  The ripples on a pond are correlated with the stone dropped in, for example.  There is a very big difference between mental states and ripples on a pond, clearly, but the the notion of correlation with physical reality is shared between the two.  I'd have to wait for a better definition of "about", used in this context, to make a better response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6) Free will and personal responsibility&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If humans are purely physical, then all our actions are determined by sensory inputs and genetic programming." {.theist}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No argument there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Biological determinism is not compatible with free will, and free will is required for personal responsibility." {.theist}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libertarian free will is what is being implied here, and I'd have to agree.  There are other forms of "free will" which is completely consistent with biological determinism, such as &lt;a href="http://bigthink.com/videos/daniel-dennett-explains-consciousness-and-free-will"&gt;those proposed by Dan Dennett&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our experience of moral choices and moral responsibility requires free will, and free will requires minds/souls." {.theist}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry, this doesn't follow.  If free will is an illusion, perhaps a useful one for a functioning society, then our experience of it is in no way evidence of its existence.  You would need to demonstrate this claim, beyond saying "It feels like I have free will" or "It feels like I make moral decisions".  Again, just because it feels like the Earth is flat and unmoving doesn't mean it is so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in sum, we have evidence that the activity of the brain is identical to the mind.  The claims made in the article quoted above amount to nothing but unsubstantiated assertions, and the appeal to so-called common sense and feeling deep down that it is true. In science we hold things to higher standards, and that is a good thing.  To cling to dualism because it simply &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; right is a desperate move.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>How to Dodge the Consequences of Belief</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/how-to-dodge-the-consequences-of-belief.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-03-13T00:00:00-04:00</published><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2014-03-13:how-to-dodge-the-consequences-of-belief.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I was recently reminded of an old &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt95KHe6hUU"&gt;interview of Alister McGrath by Richard Dawkins&lt;/a&gt;.  When I first listened to this, quite some time ago, I recall feeling that McGrath was rather slippery, that I listened for an entire hour and still couldn't really determine what the guy actually believed was true.  I listened to it again, over the past couple days, and can see why I had my initial impression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/vt95KHe6hUU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id="faith"&gt;Faith&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They start with a discussion about the term &lt;em&gt;faith&lt;/em&gt;, and McGrath basically says that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we're dealing with a different situation than, for example, evidence that the moon orbits the earth at a certain distance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there are many possible ways of explaining [the world], and we have to make the very difficult judgement of which is the best of these [explanations]...evidence takes us thus far, but then when it comes to deciding between a number of competing explanations, it is extremely difficult to make an evidence-driven argument&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe faith is rational, in the sense that it tries to make the best possible sense of things...even though we believe this is the best possible sense of things, we cannot &lt;em&gt;prove&lt;/em&gt; this is the case...there is a point where [faith] goes &lt;em&gt;beyond&lt;/em&gt; the evidence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So essentially, as I read it, he is talking about probabilistic reasoning, yet if faith is simply probabilistic reasoning then why have another word?  Why not talk about evidence, and the weight of probabilities?  Historians, for example, don't use the word &lt;em&gt;faith&lt;/em&gt; even though they deal with probabilities, some of which are highly uncertain.  Scientists all the time deal with probabilities, without invoking the word &lt;em&gt;faith&lt;/em&gt; in any paper.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, McGrath ignores the fact that there already is a proper and rational method to address the "decision between a number of competing explanations", that &lt;em&gt;doesn't&lt;/em&gt; go beyond the evidence, and doesn't claim more knowledge than is justified.  What is this method?  It's called the mathematics of probability!  So, McGrath is claiming there is a problem that faith solves, which is not a problem at all, and he is using the word faith (at the moment) as synonymous with probability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is he doing this?  It seems as if it is because McGrath is holding to a double standard, and shifts the definitions of concepts around whenever pressed.  He doesn't like the notion of believing strongly without sufficient evidence (which is truly what faith is), so he defines it (at the moment) to be equivalent to probabilities.  Of course he doesn't actually admit this, and if pressed he'd say that &lt;em&gt;faith&lt;/em&gt; is more than a synonym for probability, but he fails to define it properly.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="inference-to-the-best-explanation"&gt;Inference to the Best Explanation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So McGrath basically then goes on to talk about probabilistic reasoning, and says that with faith one is doing &lt;em&gt;inference to the best explanation&lt;/em&gt;, given a number of competing multiple explanations.  As I stated earlier, if all he means is that faith is probabilistic reasoning, then we don't have an argument - except in making things clear.  I would contend, along with Dawkins, the the &lt;em&gt;vast&lt;/em&gt; majority of people do not take it to mean this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I'd like to also challenge his basic premise here: that in dealing with multiple competing explanations that one should try to "infer to the best explanation", and &lt;em&gt;believe strongly in that explanation&lt;/em&gt;.  A simple example, used in other contexts, suffices to see this.  Say we have two explanations of the number of stars, one which says that there is an &lt;em&gt;even&lt;/em&gt; number of stars and another that says that there is an &lt;em&gt;odd&lt;/em&gt; number of stars.  Pretty much we know that, at any given instant, one of these &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be true.  However strong belief in either one is completely unwarranted - there is simply no way to know.  From a probabilistic framework, we express this as &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
P({\rm odd}) &amp;amp;=&amp;amp;0.5 \\\\
P({\rm even})&amp;amp;=&amp;amp;0.5
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it is worse than that.  Let's say we had a smidgen of evidence toward the even-star model, such that we had:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
P({\rm odd}) &amp;amp;=&amp;amp;0.499995 \\\\
P({\rm even})&amp;amp;=&amp;amp;0.500005
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though there is a &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; explanation here (&lt;em&gt;even&lt;/em&gt; is slightly more probable than &lt;em&gt;odd&lt;/em&gt;), and we have the exact probabilities, it is &lt;em&gt;still irrational&lt;/em&gt; to hold strong belief in either explanation.  One really does have to look where the weight of the probabilities lay.  Inference to the best explanation fails as a guiding principle in the face of uncertainty, and is not well defined in all contexts.  I don't think McGrath is actually doing proper probabilistic inference at all, but even if he were, this "best explanation" approach fails to address our knowledge of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="playing-dodgeball-with-an-apologist"&gt;Playing Dodgeball with an Apologist&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here is how the game is played, and why I had my initial impression of slipperiness about McGrath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First it was "faith is reasonable", based on evidence, going beyond the evidence to the "inference to the best explanation" and that as a result one can have a reasonable faith in God&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When asked about his belief in a creator, and the evidence for it, despite having difficulty with the implied complexity of such a creator, he says &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to go back to CS Lewis who says I believe in Christianity as I believe the Sun has risen, not simply because I see &lt;strong&gt;it&lt;/strong&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;by it&lt;/strong&gt; I see everything else.  Belief in God gives you a way of seeing the world that makes an awful lot of sense of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When pressed on what this implies, he says that "there are many reasons I believe in God and that [origins] is not even the primary one"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He then says that "religion really isn't much about where things came from, about things in the distant past, but really about how things are now.  How to live your life, how to be moral, etc..."  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then this  becomes  "the key reason for believing God is Jesus, that there is something [in the Jesus story] that needs explanation"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then this becomes that it is not really about the life of Jesus, and his historicity, but how he was perceived by his followers - the significance they saw in the life and teaching of Jesus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice how this keeps shifting?  Every time he gets pushed on the specific consequences of his statement, he retreats, redefines, and redirects the conversation.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He doesn't seem to realize that any explanation, even of things currently, entails assumptions that can be tested - perhaps with observations about the past.  He can't simply say that religion is "not about where things came from", when they explicitly make statements of origins - statements which have been universally discredited.   The atonement, for example, &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; depend critically on the existence of Jesus, the existence the "Fall", and a creator of the universe - for none of which did McGrath provide evidence.  If Jesus didn't exist as a real person (or even if he was just an ordinary guy) then it doesn't matter that his followers simply &lt;em&gt;believed&lt;/em&gt; that Jesus was God incarnate when determining ones belief in the doctrine of salvation.  The demonstration of the historicity of the events claimed is &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; for the doctrinal belief.  If you don't have strong evidence of the former, then you are not rational to believe strongly in the latter - you'd be claiming to know things you could not know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a scientist, one takes an idea, and pushes the idea to it furthest consequences to see where it breaks, or to see what it depends on.  McGrath changes the topic whenever this is done - he does not want to face the very real, specific consequences of his stated beliefs and refuses to see the connections between the things that may be confirmable (apparent design in the biology and the universe itself, historicity of people and events, alleged miracle claims, etc...) and the things that make him feel good, but are unmeasurable (existence of heaven, the atonement of sins, etc...).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-problem-of-evil"&gt;The Problem of Evil&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His biggest dodge came with the problem of evil.  When initially asked about it, he says that there are two basic approaches.  One is to "find an explanation for it, but that doesn't get us really far because we can't really make sense of these things".  And the other approach is to address how to "cope with suffering" that is a part of this world.  Now that is an amazing admission!  He's basically missing the point of the argument, either willfully or otherwise, to focus on what feels good.  He wants to wave away the real consequences of the beliefs he is claiming to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McGrath was quick to make the following statements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God does not act directly in this world&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The single child saved in a tragedy killing ten thousand people he'd interpret as an act of God, and thus God is responsible for this child being saved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The killing of ten thousand people was not God's fault, but rather perhaps there is no other way for the universe to be this way&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the contradictions here?  McGrath couldn't.  Either God acts in the world, and is measurable, or he does not act in the world and is thus either impotent, immoral, or simply indifferent.  The problem of evil has no other outlet.  If you try to argue (as William Lane Craig does) that God may have sufficient reasons, then you undermine the entire notion of personal conscience - the seemingly immoral actions (or inactions) of God fly in the face of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="one-final-thought"&gt;One final thought&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McGrath stresses again and again the &lt;em&gt;usefulness&lt;/em&gt; of religion, without once demonstrating that it is &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt;.  He failed, again and again, to address the immediate consequences of his beliefs and simply dodged at every point, in order to wallow in generalities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From time to time we see a headline like &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/science-technology/437733/The-end-of-the-world-IS-nigh-Huge-asteroid-will-hit-earth-in-2032-claim-astronomers"&gt;The end of the world IS nigh: Huge asteroid 'will hit earth in 2032' claim astronomers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; or a more modest one from this week's close-shave, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/space/10644805/Asteroid-to-hurtle-past-the-Earth-at-27000-mph.html"&gt;Asteroid to hurtle past the Earth at 27,000 mph&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and you are reminded of the random dangers that exist for us fragile creatures on this planet.  I do have to grin whenever I hear the term "end of the world" (not used in the second article), because the end of the world will pretty much only happen when our &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_of_the_Earth#Red_giant_stage"&gt;Sun possibly consumes it in 5 billion years&lt;/a&gt; - the world is a big rock and hard to get rid of.  What is intended in such phrases, of course, is the end of our lives on this world, which will happen at some point almost certainly much much sooner than that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever I see headlines about rocks flying close by, I go over to the &lt;a href="http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/ca/"&gt;Near Earth Objects site&lt;/a&gt; and look at the close approaches.  This week's particular rock, labeled &lt;a href="http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=2000%20EM26;orb=1"&gt;2000 EM26&lt;/a&gt;, will pass within 9 lunar distances which is pretty close on the solar system scale.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is educational, and fun, to &lt;a href="http://www.lsst.org/lsst/public/neo1"&gt;read about these sorts of dangers&lt;/a&gt;.  From the chart below, this week's rock, if it were to strike, would deliver well over 100 megatons of TNT of energy, much larger than our largest nuclear bombs.  Yikes!  Luckily, this is unlikely to happen - for this rock.  However, it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; likely to happen at some point.  I'm not sure if that makes for an optimistic or pessimistic message, but I'll let you decide. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;sort of scientific&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not at all scientific&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…more than half think astrology is either &lt;em&gt;"scientific"&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;"sort of scientific"&lt;/em&gt;.  At first I was dismayed, but then when I thought about it, I honestly wasn't sure what to answer. My immediate impulse was to shy away from the &lt;em&gt;"not at all"&lt;/em&gt; designation - that wording seemed too strong for anything in science.  Then, upon further reflection, I realized that what I didn't like was actually the term &lt;em&gt;"scientific"&lt;/em&gt;, in this context.  What does it mean exactly?  Is it really just a  synonym for &lt;em&gt;"supported by the evidence"&lt;/em&gt;?  If so, then the &lt;em&gt;"not at all supported by the evidence"&lt;/em&gt; would indeed be too strong - there is at least &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; evidence for astrology, albeit so meager and terrible that no one should be convinced or take it seriously.  I have a similar response to the hyperbolic statement that &lt;em&gt;"there is no evidence for god"&lt;/em&gt;.  It's not that there is &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; evidence, it's simply that the evidence is not convincing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking further, I wondered can a &lt;em&gt;topic&lt;/em&gt; be scientific or not scientific, when science really refers to a &lt;em&gt;process&lt;/em&gt;?  Is the spontaneous generation of life not scientific?  It can be investigated, and shown to be both unlikely and unnecessary to explain the data, but does that make it &lt;em&gt;unscientific&lt;/em&gt;?  Or is it just that believing in it strongly, despite the evidence, is unscientific - in which case it is really the &lt;em&gt;process&lt;/em&gt; that is being labeled unscientific.  Not proportioning ones belief to the strength of the evidence is unscientific (and by definition irrational).  Not following the processes of science is unskeptical and unscientific, but the topic itself cannot be &lt;em&gt;"scientific"&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;"not scientific"&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps a topic could be not scientific if it is &lt;em&gt;untestable&lt;/em&gt;, like deism.  However, astrology does not fall into that category either.  In fact one student, when I implemented the survey in class, later admitted that they voted for &lt;em&gt;"scientific"&lt;/em&gt; because of the detailed tests that could be done for astrology.  So if you are testing the claims of astrology, and following scientific procedures, does that make astrology scientific or not?  Does it even make &lt;em&gt;"scientific"&lt;/em&gt; a coherent label for a topic of inquiry?  I don't think so. I think the term scientific &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; refer to a process, not a subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps a better wording would be 'well supported by the data', 'not well supported by the data', and 'barely to not at all supported by the data'.  Where it says &lt;em&gt;data&lt;/em&gt; here, replace with &lt;em&gt;evidence&lt;/em&gt; if that reads better.  I'm no expert on survey wording, but this one must be improved, I believe.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="science"></category><category term="pseudoscience"></category></entry><entry><title>Scientific Knowledge</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/scientific-knowledge.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-02-12T00:00:00-05:00</published><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2014-02-12:scientific-knowledge.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="http://brianblais.wordpress.com/2013/05/10/creationist-math/#comment-706"&gt;comment on my Wordpress site&lt;/a&gt; (a site I am replacing with this one) on a post about "&lt;a href="creationist-math.html"&gt;Creationist Math&lt;/a&gt;", the commenter says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe we all choose to have faith in one book or another. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is simply, and demonstrably, not true.  First, &lt;strong&gt;faith is the belief in things without sufficient evidence&lt;/strong&gt; - once you have evidence, it no longer is faith.  Second, scientists don't simply take a "book" as an authority - on anything.  The only authority is Nature herself, if you permit me a bit of anthropomorphic imagery there.  Any idea is entertained, and then tested against what reality is.  In no way would a scientist, performing science, simply "have faith in one book or another".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who knows what part of our “scientific knowledge” people are going to make fun of a few generations from now as we do from generations that came before?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I was thinking about this, and was trying to come up with a list of things that were once felt to be known by scientists and yet we make fun of now.  Pretty much the only examples I could come up with are things like the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the glib use of radioactivity, when we first started to use radioactivity for things (e.g. sizing shoes with x-rays)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the frequent use of antibiotics, when we first started to use antibiotics regularly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phlogiston_theory"&gt;phlogiston theory&lt;/a&gt;, when we were working out the theory of thermodynamics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps I am missing some really good examples. In each case I could think of, however, the common theme was a field that was either &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; or highly &lt;em&gt;uncertain&lt;/em&gt; (like much of medicine).  So, on the fringes of science, we can look back and point to many things that were wrong or where the scientists were unjustifiably confident.  However, we have other things like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Newton's theory of gravity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Theory of optics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Atomic theory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evolution theory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;all of which have withstood more than 100 years of scrutiny, and although some of the initial &lt;em&gt;details&lt;/em&gt; have been shown to be incomplete, they haven't been substantially modified for a long time, and they aren't about to change &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt;.  10,000 years from now, Newton's laws will still be the best description of the mid-world (not too small, not too big and fast).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a quick example about the preservation of bones, the commenter ended with this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure there’s a way to explain this issue logically, and as you say – us religious have a biased perspective and we make up our numbers… I agree… I also believe that ironically you do the same thing. Why don’t we just agree that we both have faith in our perspectives?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An admission that creationists "make up their numbers" is a pretty bold admission!  I would want to see evidence that I "ironically" do the same thing.  At what point have I "made up numbers"?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point of my post was that if you spin out the consequences of the claims of creationists, they lead to ridiculous results, or fly in the face of the data itself.  This is how we dismantle false ideas, to leave the true ones.  If there is a specific claim you want me to evaluate, let me know!  If you can demonstrate convincingly that something I have claimed is incorrect, I would celebrate!  It's a win-win for me - I learn something new, and I will then believe one fewer wrong thing in life.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, no, I will not agree that we both have "faith", or confidence in our positions without evidence.  If you show me the evidence, I'll change my mind, of course.  &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="science"></category><category term="creationism"></category><category term="evolution"></category><category term="religion"></category></entry><entry><title>Creationism Laid Bare</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/creationism-laid-bare.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-02-06T00:00:00-05:00</published><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2014-02-06:creationism-laid-bare.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/z6kgvhG3AkI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seems as if everyone is talking about the recent Ken Ham vs Bill Nye debate on evolution and creation, so I figured I'd put in my two cents.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn't help but notice the use of the word "proof" in this debate especially by Ken Ham.  After reading my &lt;a href="http://web.bryant.edu/~bblais/anyone-using-the-term-scientific-proof-doesnt-know-science.html"&gt;post about proof&lt;/a&gt;, can one really maintain that my distinction between "proof" and "evidence" is "splitting hairs", as one commenter put it?  Said another way, when Ken Ham says "You can't prove the world is 5 billion years old, you weren't there", is this not obviously a word-game?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The debate was not as bad as I thought it would be.  Ken Ham did not do a &lt;a href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Gish_Gallop"&gt;Gish Gallop&lt;/a&gt;, much to my relief.  I think it may encourage other scientists to deal with this problem of creationism, although I do recognize the strength in the argument that "debates" on topics that are not in debate in the scientific community can give credence to the pseudoscience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no experience in debate, so take my criticisms with a grain of salt, especially given that I think Nye did quite a good job.  I thought it was great that Nye used CSI to point out there is no difference between Ham's so-called "observational science" and "historical science".  I think he could have gone a lot further and pointed out that parallel at every point.  For example, what if one of the investigators brought out a 100 year old book that claimed that the butler did it?  What would the other investigators say, and why?  What if the first investigator said that he was starting with the position that the 100 year old book was absolutely true, and that nothing could sway him from that position?  Placed in a more familiar setting, Ken Ham's position is seen to be ridiculous. Essentially we have a difference of &lt;em&gt;methodology&lt;/em&gt; that needs to be highlighted, and one could use CSI examples to really accentuate that difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To bring out the nature of evidence in assessing claims, even in the past, and lay bare this distinction that Ham likes between observational and historical one can simply explore the question (in an entertaining way, as only Nye can do) which forms the basis for all of scientific thought:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have two people claiming different things, how do we distinguish between what is true and what is not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Ham kept saying "You can't prove the world is 5 billion years old, you weren't there", I would have first reminded everyone of the distinction between evidence and proof.  More importantly I would also point out that the entire premise of shows like CSI is that the investigators &lt;em&gt;were not there&lt;/em&gt; and yet can establish to a high confidence what happened!  Essentially, using Ham's argument, every CSI episode would have to end "you can't know, you weren't there!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I'm a bit more partial to Columbo, it is the case in all of these sorts of shows that different hypotheses about "who done it" lead to different conclusions.  Often they point in the same direction on some observations, like the two hypotheses "the butler did it" and the "the cook did it" are consistent with the observation that the victim seemed to know the person attacking them.  But they also predict &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; possible observations, such as footprints, or tracks left in the hall.  Ham claimed that the global flood could lay down fossil beds.  Nye countered with "why did &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; mammal happen to sink down to the level of the dinosaurs (of the same size?", and "why do we see no evidence of kangaroos between the Middle East and Australia?".  These are exactly right, and one can drive this home again and again.  Pointing out the cherry-picking of the creationist is essential!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ham made a big deal about the assumptions of radiometric dating.  A quick comment about how one can establish the confidence in these methods by calibrating with &lt;em&gt;known&lt;/em&gt; processes (e.g. tree rings, sediment layering) would have been nice.  When this is done, it is amazing that all of these &lt;em&gt;independent&lt;/em&gt; processes lead to the &lt;em&gt;same&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dalrymple/scientific_age_earth.html"&gt;estimates of age&lt;/a&gt;, within the uncertainties.  The creationist would have us believe that this is just a coincidence!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, there were I think two statements by Ham that I found refreshing.  He flatly admitted that he was &lt;em&gt;starting with&lt;/em&gt; Biblical inerrancy, and working from there.  He also flatly admitted that &lt;em&gt;no evidence&lt;/em&gt; would sway him from that position.  Those two statements really do lay the creationist agenda bare.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="science"></category><category term="creationism"></category><category term="evolution"></category><category term="religion"></category></entry><entry><title>Anyone using the term "scientific proof" doesn't know science</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/anyone-using-the-term-scientific-proof-doesnt-know-science.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-01-31T00:00:00-05:00</published><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2014-01-31:anyone-using-the-term-scientific-proof-doesnt-know-science.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In my introduction to probability in class this week, I was asked if proof and evidence really meant the same thing.  They don't.  To summarize,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Proof&lt;/em&gt; does not exist in science, only in math an philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only place you can have proof is where you have &lt;em&gt;axioms&lt;/em&gt; (i.e. unprovable assertions), and can then &lt;em&gt;prove&lt;/em&gt; a number of consequences of those axioms.  We can prove, for example, that the sum of the angles of a triangle is 180 degrees, if we start with the Euclidean axioms of geometry.  Science doesn't have axioms, and thus there are no proofs - there is only evidence.  We sometimes hear the term "proven scientifically", even from people who should know better (like Richard Carrier in his &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLvWz9GQ3PQ"&gt;"Is Philosophy Stupid" talk&lt;/a&gt;, his &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Proving-History-Bayess-Theorem-Historical/dp/1616145595"&gt;books&lt;/a&gt;, and his &lt;a href="http://infidels.org/library/modern/richard_carrier/theory.html"&gt;articles&lt;/a&gt;).  Other treatments of this topic can be found on the &lt;a href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Proof"&gt;RationalWiki&lt;/a&gt; and on &lt;a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/sciproof.html"&gt;talkorigins&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mapping to probability theory is quite easy: proofs involve probabilities which are either &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P=1\)&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P=0\)&lt;/span&gt;.  Another way of putting it is,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the evidence in the world cannot bring the probability of a scientific claim to certainty.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see this with probability theory, imagine we have two hypotheses for the Earth - flat earth and round earth.  We can write Bayes' Rule for the probability of each given the data.  Note that this data includes things like the experience of airplane flight, Magellan's trip, pictures from space - all of which could be faked!  The flat earth hypothesis is not &lt;em&gt;logically&lt;/em&gt; impossible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
P({\rm round}|{\rm data}) &amp;amp;=&amp;amp; \frac{P({\rm data}|{\rm round})P({\rm round})}{P({\rm data}|{\rm flat})P({\rm flat})+P({\rm data}|{\rm round})P({\rm round})}\\\\
P({\rm flat}|{\rm data}) &amp;amp;=&amp;amp; \frac{P({\rm data}|{\rm flat})P({\rm flat})}{P({\rm data}|{\rm flat})P({\rm flat})+P({\rm data}|{\rm round})P({\rm round})} 
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that, no matter how well the round earth hypothesis explains the data, 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$P({\rm data}|{\rm round})\approx 1$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
and how unlikely you believe it is that the Earth is flat even &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the data (a far too strong of an anti-flat Earth bias than is actually warranted),
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$P({\rm flat})\ll 1$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
as long as there is some &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; (even if seriously contrived) way to explain the data with the flat earth hypothesis, 
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$P({\rm data}|{\rm flat}) \neq 0$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
it is &lt;em&gt;mathematically impossible&lt;/em&gt; to make the round earth hypothesis certain,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$P({\rm round}|{\rm data})\le 1$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the right-hand side of Bayes' Rule, the larger the round-earth terms and the flat-earth terms get to 1 and 0, respectively,  the closer the left-hand terms get to 1 and 0, but they never &lt;em&gt;equal&lt;/em&gt; 1 and 0.  This does not mean that we can't be &lt;em&gt;confident&lt;/em&gt; of claims, only that we cannot have &lt;em&gt;absolute certainty of anything&lt;/em&gt; in science (and therefore, in life in general).  Anyone who doesn't understand that does not understand science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Positively, a rational belief is any belief that is either properly non-basic or properly basic. A properly non-basic belief is a belief that is held appropriately in light of supporting evidence. A properly basic belief is a belief that is held appropriately but which does not require evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems as if, with this definition, properly basic beliefs are equivalent in function to axioms in mathematics.  Fair enough.  Examples Rauser and others have used for properly basic beliefs include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your friend Joe says he ate cornflakes this morning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The testimony of your wife saying that it is raining outside where she is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus rose from the dead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A banana is in front of me, because I see it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2+2=4.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I am no philosopher (or perhaps I am, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLvWz9GQ3PQ"&gt;depending on whom you ask&lt;/a&gt;).  That being said, I don't find the concept of "properly basic belief" to be at all clarifying, when we have words like axioms.  But, for the sake of charity, I will consider the axioms of math to be properly basic for much of this post.  I think, however, that even something as basic as "2+2=4" is an &lt;em&gt;empirical&lt;/em&gt; relationship.  If the rules of the universe were such that sometimes "2+2=5", then we'd have a different math, and thus the rules of math are really tied to the rules of the universe.  However, I could imagine someone successfully arguing that the basic laws of math are "properly basic" in the sense that Rauser would want - rationally held without requiring evidence.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But aside from that, I don't think that &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; of the other cases are properly basic in this way, &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; testimony of &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; kind.  Rauser will say thing like, belief in the testimony of your wife is a properly basic belief because you don't need to go check it out further, get documentary evidence and video evidence to verify it, but you can still believe it rationally.  I would agree with all of that, but that &lt;em&gt;doesn't&lt;/em&gt; make it properly basic.  You don't need to get &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; evidence, but that doesn't imply that you are accepting it &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; evidence.  You have the evidence of your entire experience with your wife, as a trustworthy person.  How do you know she's trustworthy?  Empirically!  You also have the experience, in general, that even typically untrustworthy people don't tend to be untrustworthy about mundane claims.  When you assess the probability that it is truly raining, given your wife's testimony, you are really doing that with a lot of other &lt;em&gt;empirical&lt;/em&gt; evidence that you have built up over your life.  It is easy to see this is the case, because changing the context can completely change whether you are rational to accept the testimony.  Let's say that your wife is in Antarctica.  Surely it would not be rational to accept her testimony, and more rational to think she is joking, exaggerating, or mistaken.  The same testimony, with a different background experience, yields different probability assignments and thus a different strength of belief in the claim.  Thus, the testimony alone cannot be a properly basic belief.  You can follow this line of argument for the cornflakes example as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason we do not simply trust the testimony of others on resurrection claims is the same reason we wouldn't trust the claim of rain in Antarctica - especially because rain in Antarctica is &lt;em&gt;more likely&lt;/em&gt; than a resurrection.  We have established, empirically, when testimony can be trusted (not at 100 percent ever!), and when it can't.  We've established certain patterns that occur when testimony is wrong, and those patterns exist in the Biblical claims.  We've established historical patterns, the process of information transmission, the influence of political entities, the scientific workings of the universe, etc...  All of this comes into play when establishing the probability of the resurrection.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we take the axioms of mathematics to be "properly basic", then the probability calculus follows from that, which includes the proper procedures for updating states of knowledge given evidence.  All other claims must be based on evidence to be rational, and thus cannot be "properly basic", or axiomatic.  Want to challenge the axioms of math?  Good luck with that!  If we agree to take the axioms of math as "properly basic", then all we need to say is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Axioms [of math] are statements we believe rationally with no evidence.  All other things need to be believed only with sufficient evidence, and the strength of the belief should scale with the evidence.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is simply a consequence of the math, probability theory in this case.  You'll note that the entire term "properly basic" has disappeared, and introducing it would only muddy the discussion, making things less clear than a straightforward application of probability theory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One final thought.  I get the feeling, and I doubt I could ever demonstrate this convincingly, that the only reason someone would suggest that God, or the resurrection, are "properly basic" is because there is so little evidence for these claims yet the proponents do not want to admit that they are being irrational, so the only choice is to dispense with evidence for rational belief altogether.  It smacks of a desperate move, but perhaps it is just an example of Shermer's "&lt;a href="http://www.michaelshermer.com/2002/09/smart-people-believe-weird-things/"&gt;smart people believing weird things&lt;/a&gt;", where they are smart about rationalizing things they came to believe for non-smart reasons.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In either case, I believe it is important to stick to well-established mathematical vocabulary when discussing the basis for beliefs, and not introduce vocabulary that is  unnecessary and, as a consequence, unclear.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="religion"></category><category term="philosophy"></category><category term="science"></category><category term="probability"></category></entry><entry><title>Physics and the Flash Mind Reader</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/physics-and-the-flash-mind-reader.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-01-22T00:00:00-05:00</published><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2014-01-22:physics-and-the-flash-mind-reader.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;While preparing for physics class, I found this gem:  the &lt;a href="http://www.flashlightcreative.net/swf/mindreader/"&gt;Flash Mind Reader&lt;/a&gt;!  So, here is a simple website which claims to read your mind.  This is a pretty extraordinary claim, so I would want extraordinary evidence.  It's a nice exercise in evaluating claims.  First, we ask, &lt;em&gt;does it do what it specifically claims to do, regardless of interpretation?&lt;/em&gt;.  On the site, it asks you to think of a two-digit number, then do some basic math on it to get another number, which you then look up on a table.  The table associates the final number with a symbol, and it is that symbol which the "Mind Reader" determines.  So regardless of whether the interpretation is a psychic process, or some mundane process, does the process work as claimed?  In many extraordinary claims of this sort, the claimant fails even at this preliminary step.  This is well documented at the &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/1m-challenge/challenge-faq.html"&gt;JREF Challenge&lt;/a&gt; site.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in the case of the &lt;a href="http://www.flashlightcreative.net/swf/mindreader/"&gt;Flash Mind Reader&lt;/a&gt;, the process does seem to work!  Okay, then the next step kicks in.  How many ways can we think of this thing to work, and can we test them?  Is it &lt;em&gt;overly skeptical&lt;/em&gt; to not consider mind-reading in that list?  I don't think so, but we could probably come up with some tests even there.  For example, would it work done on a group of people all at once?  If it did, that would certainly count &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; mind reading.  Here are a few ways that I initially thought it could work, and I could quickly discount them by looking at the table, or trying it a few times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;does the calculation lead to the same number each time?  No!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is it the same symbol each time you run it?  No!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do all the numbers have the same symbol?  No!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a little imagination, one can come up with a probable explanation that does not involve telepathy, but it is a nice recreation of the way a scientist would address &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; claim, extraordinary or not.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Philosophy and Science - What's the Difference?</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/philosophy-and-science-whats-the-difference.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-01-21T00:00:00-05:00</published><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2014-01-21:philosophy-and-science-whats-the-difference.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In a discussion on &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tH3AnYyAI8"&gt;The Limits Of Science&lt;/a&gt; with Lawrence Krass, Dan Dennett, and Massimo Pigliucci, there is much haggling over the relationship between science and philosophy.  Although I think they all "got it" in the end, it would have been much more direct if they adopted my definition of philosophy (and they didn't consult me?).  If you go back and listen to the debate, keeping the definition below in mind, one can see where each of them is correct even when it seems as if they are contradicting themselves.   The definition of philosophy is the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Philosophy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philosophy is science without data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What that definition does is it makes sense of Pigliucci's claim that &lt;em&gt;"philosophy is about clarifying questions"&lt;/em&gt;, but it also  makes sense of Krauss' claim that &lt;em&gt;"philosophy doesn't benefit working scientists&lt;/em&gt;" (in physics, he adds).  The result of the definition is that now we can see a continuum between philosophy and science, dictated by the amount of data, or possibly the quality of the data.  So when Dennett says that philosophy is important in neuroscience and cognitive science, what he's saying is that the level of data in those fields is at such an undeveloped level that philosophy is needed to help frame the questions.  This is simply an admission that these fields are in their infancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not entirely sure whether philosophers would particularly like this way of phrasing, but it does seem to make sense of a lot of the confusion which typically surrounds these discussions.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="philosophy"></category><category term="science"></category><category term="data"></category></entry><entry><title>Chess, Morality, and Well-Being</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/chess-morality-and-well-being.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-01-17T00:00:00-05:00</published><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2014-01-17:chess-morality-and-well-being.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In a discussion on &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tH3AnYyAI8"&gt;The Limits Of Science&lt;/a&gt; with Lawrence Krass, Dan Dennett, and Massimo Pigliucci, Dan Dennett makes an analogy with chess (and its rules) to morality.  The analogy goes something like this.  He says the game of chess has been improved over time.  Things like the addition of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castling"&gt;castling&lt;/a&gt; rule,  things like the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En_passant"&gt;en passant&lt;/a&gt; rule, and so on have improved the game. These are done because people like to have a fast-moving game, or one that doesn't take forever.   He then said something like, if you had two groups of people that disagreed about the different rules of the game, each thinking a different set of rules was superior and if one side couldn't convince the other of their perspective, then there really wasn't a "right answer".  He  implied that there would be a right answer if one group &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; convince the other one of the superiority of their side, and he thought that this was like morality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However I think, if you take &lt;a href="http://fora.tv/2010/11/10/Sam_Harris_Can_Science_Determine_Human_Values"&gt;Sam Harris' perspective on morality&lt;/a&gt; as I typically do, you notice that even for Dennett there is a &lt;em&gt;reason&lt;/em&gt; why different versions of chess would be better, and it doesn't come up for a vote.   People prefer certain types of games and this leads to an increase in the well-being of those people that play them. Certain rule changes would be better because some changes would lead to longer games, or more difficult games, and thus decrease overall well-being.  It becomes an objective fact about human consciousness and games.  Both in the area of morality, and in this analogy, there &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; be right and wrong answers to those questions based on the well-being of people.  Dennett's analogy might be closer than he thinks,  but not in the way he intends. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="chess"></category><category term="morality"></category><category term="Dennett"></category></entry><entry><title>Why the new website?</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/why-the-new-website.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-01-13T19:38:55-05:00</published><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2014-01-13:why-the-new-website.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I completely changed the framework that I use for &lt;a href="http://web.bryant.edu/~bblais"&gt;my website&lt;/a&gt;, changing it from Rapidweaver (a mac-based, GUI website editor) to &lt;a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.3.0/"&gt;pelican&lt;/a&gt;, a Python-based framework for making static websites.  Why did I do this?  There are many reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I liked the way that the website &lt;em&gt;becomes&lt;/em&gt; a blog, so that updates to my research are more easily organized and documented&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am a control freak with such things, and like complete configurability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I like writing content in &lt;a href="http://http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/"&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt;, so that I can make small textual changes in the site without opening up a bloated editor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working in Markdown makes it easier to change frameworks/structure in the future&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me know if things work, or don't!  I'd love to know if comments work, and if it is easy to follow updates via Atom, or perhaps RSS.  You can contact me at &lt;em&gt;bblais at gmail.com or bryant.edu&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
