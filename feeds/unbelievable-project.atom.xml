&lt;li&gt;Justin Brierley - Christian Moderator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Peter May - Christian&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John Loftus - Atheist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="notes"&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter - outlines the argument from first cause:{.theist}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;everything that begins to exist has a cause{.theist}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the universe has a beginning{.theist}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;therefore the universe has a cause (i.e. creator){.theist}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the creator must be uncaused, and must be an agent to create, therefore must be a personal mind.{.theist}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This argument is totally unconvincing to me, and I doubt many really have faith due to this argument.  What are my biggest problems?  Here is a short list:{.me}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"everything that begins to exist has a cause" - this is stated, but never demonstrated.  In fact, there are uncaused events in quantum mechanics.{.me}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"the universe has a beginning" - our universe, perhaps, had a singularity where time and space started.  Is that a beginning?  Perhaps.  Perhaps it is part of a multi-verse that is eternal, and this is just one event in it.  Given this possibility, even this claim doesn't do what he'd like it to do{.me}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"therefore the universe has a cause"  - let's, for the sake of argument, go along with this statement.  Does it really tell us about the nature of the cause?  It could be a natural cause, but something out of time and space.  There could be some other dimension, or nature, that we don't understand -- still natural -- that causes universes.  It does not require a mind, and thus does not require any personality.{.me}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has Peter demonstrated that minds can exist outside of a body?  Is there even a &lt;em&gt;single&lt;/em&gt; example of this?{.me}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter - in the Genesis story of creation, the description is &lt;em class="tq"&gt;"astonishingly close to what science says"&lt;/em&gt;.  Talking about the &lt;em&gt;"spirit moving across the water"&lt;/em&gt;, he claims Genesis fits a picture of when a planet first forms, completely blackened out, where the light doesn't get through - as he claims we see planet formation today.  So we can understand the "let there be light", but the Sun comes later through the clouds, and then you get vegetation, life in the sea, land animals, and then man.  This is an &lt;em class="tq"&gt;"extraordinary process of development for a primitive people to have stumbled on"&lt;/em&gt;} {.theist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is convincing to him, and is astonishing and extraordinary? Really? Here's a summary of the days of Creation from &lt;a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1&amp;amp;version=RSV"&gt;Genesis 1&lt;/a&gt;:{.me}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Day 1 - the heavens and the earth, light, day and night{.me}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Day 2 - firmament (i.e. solid dome) for the sky {.me}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Day 3 - land and seas, vegetation {.me}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Day 4 - stars, sun, moon{.me}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Day 5 - fish and birds {.me}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Day 6 - land animals, man and woman{.me}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Day 7 - resting{.me}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we are going to overlook the fact that &lt;a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+2&amp;amp;version=RSV"&gt;Genesis 2&lt;/a&gt; has a different order, where animals are created &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; humans.  Even the order in &lt;a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1&amp;amp;version=RSV"&gt;Genesis 1&lt;/a&gt; leaves a lot to be desired.  Peter claims that the day and night before the sun is due to the sun not being able to shine down through the clouds, which is not even &lt;em&gt;hinted&lt;/em&gt; at in the text and is a desperate move of harmonization.  Further, this list of creation has plants before the sun, so either way you have a problem - the plants could not have grown before the sun poked through the clouds even if we take Peter's strained reading of the text.  The Earth is not separated to the heavens by a "firmament" (i.e. solid dome), and there are not holes in that firmament for the starlight.  According to our best understanding, land animals came before birds and fish came before vegetation.  This account doesn't even remotely sound like science to me.  {.me}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put another way, if this description of creation was so close to what modern science says about the universe, why did it take thousands of years for people to recognize that the Earth went around the Sun, and that the Sun was part of a Galaxy?  If you read the &lt;a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1&amp;amp;version=RSV"&gt;Genesis 1&lt;/a&gt; account, and knew nothing else in the world, would it suggest to you that there are other planets?  What about galaxies?  Does it suggest the time scales between the formation of the universe and the formation of the Earth?  Does it suggest that the Sun is a star or that the Moon is a rock whereas the Sun is a ball of plasma?   Does it suggest, even remotely, any process of evolution?  The answer is a clear &lt;em&gt;No&lt;/em&gt;.{.me}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter is engaged in the worst sort of cherry-picking and rose-colored (or more appropriately, science-colored) glasses all the way down.{.me}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter - In the face of the spread and success of Christianity, doesn't this suggest that there is a truth there?  {.theist}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truth is not decided by success of transmission.  Both Mormonism and Islam have had very recent success in spreading, and yet Christians don't take them seriously.  Truth should cross borders, like science does, and things that are cultural don't (as much).  This leads to the structure, pointed out by Dawkins, that you are much more likely to be the religion of your culture, so the geographic distribution of religious tendencies tends to be fragmented, as opposed to scientific ideas which do not follow that pattern at all.{.me}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John - The Christian &lt;em&gt;story&lt;/em&gt; is really good, which may explain why it spreads successfully.{.atheist}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How would you distinguish an idea which true versus one that is a good cultural story and is thus successful but not necessarily true?  Ideas can be popular they are imposed from above, or are tied to a dominant culture for other reasons.  Perhaps there are tests of the process of spreading which would allow one to distinguish these cases.  I am not sure. {.me}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter - He brings out three of the common arguments for God: "why is there something rather than nothing?", "the wonder of design in the universe", and our "moral perceptions".  {.theist}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"why is there something rather than nothing?" - I see two answers to this.  I am not convinced that the philosophical idea of &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; is defined or can exist, without running into serious linguistic and conceptual problems.  Laurence Krauss has a very nice lecture on a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjaGktVQdNg"&gt;Universe From Nothing&lt;/a&gt;.  Essentially it boils down to, as long as the total energy of the universe is zero, it could have come from nothing without violating any laws of physics.  This is an empirical claim which is in fact &lt;a href="http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/uni_shape.html"&gt;confirmed by experiment&lt;/a&gt;.  {.me}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"the wonder of design in the universe" - if you go back 150 years, then you'd argue from the design in biology.  However Darwin demonstrated that an unguided process can give rise to highly complex structure in biology.  Now the only claims of design are in what is called the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine-tuned_Universe"&gt;Fine Tuning of the Universe&lt;/a&gt;, and is contentious amongst physicists.  If the only design that you're going to hang God's hat on is the latest arguments on the fringe of physics, then you're really not stating that design is particularly obvious, except for those who don't understand science.{.me}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"moral perceptions" - the argument from our moral code, I believe, is undermined by the fact that moral behavior is observed in other animals.  Further, if we take a biblical view, the genocidal actions of God in the Old Testament, the concept of the Atonement which forms the basis for Christianity, and the doctrine of Hell can all be seen as highly immoral and require a lot of bending over backwards to handle.  I think these lead to insurmountable challenges to this argument. {.me}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter - The Christian story confirms the moral message in the Bible, and people immediately connect to it.  God is a moral God, good always outweighs evil, and this message is not simply tacked onto the story. {.theist}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John - You don't tell the whole story, much of which is ugly.  Babies being deliberately smashed on the rocks, the atonement, hell, etc... do not match the story you're describing. {.atheist}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter - &lt;em class="tq"&gt;"One of the remarkable things about Christianity is that you don't need a PhD to become a Christian.  The essential truths can be grasped by a very simple person indeed."&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;em class="tq"&gt;"Jesus somehow takes our moral responsibility on himself so that we can go free.  It's liberating to people."&lt;/em&gt;}    {.theist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John - &lt;em class="aq"&gt;"The God revealed in the Bible is stupid.  There is no reason for him to die on the cross for anyones' sins, there's just none.  It's part of an ancient superstitious culture of sacrificial systems."&lt;/em&gt;}  It makes Satan out to be stupid too - why would be rebel against God, knowing he's omnipotent?  How is Jesus could Jesus be God and man? These things are just not defined.  {.atheist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would add, "how is &lt;a href="https://brianblais.wordpress.com/2013/11/19/the-trinity-and-coherency/"&gt;the Trinity&lt;/a&gt; a coherent concept?"  Look at a previous post of mine on &lt;a href="https://brianblais.wordpress.com/2013/11/19/the-trinity-and-coherency/"&gt;the Trinity&lt;/a&gt; where I explore the incoherence.  Peter never deals directly with this, except to merely assert that these things are coherent, but without any demonstration of that.  {.me}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter - &lt;em&gt;"they find grounds to understand that their sins are forgiven, and before God not-guilty, whether you're Stalin or Hitler (not suggesting any of those threw themselves on Christ for mercy."&lt;/em&gt; {.tq} {.theist}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of those facets of Christianity that I have a real problem with.  They claim that good outweighs evil, that justice is accomplished in the end, yet you can have someone do terrible things and essentially play the "I found Christ, Get Out of Jail Free" card right at the end and they are saved.  The person who devotes their life to good works, helping people, reducing suffering yet isn't convinced by the paltry evidence for God around is not saved.  This, to me, is not justice.  Further, I would say that it is not ethical to punish or reward someone for an &lt;em&gt;infinite&lt;/em&gt; time for actions done during a &lt;em&gt;finite&lt;/em&gt; life.{.me}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John - Those that believe in divine grace for the people who have never heard the word of God should never want to spread the word of God to others, because the result of that preaching would then implies that the target person's conscience is no longer taken into account, and the simple act of not believing the message condemns them. {.atheist}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John - &lt;em class="aq"&gt;"The &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2007/03/outsider-test-for-faith.html"&gt;Outsider Test of Faith&lt;/a&gt; is merely a test to judge all positive claims equally, and I do apply it to my atheism.  I am first and foremost an agnostic who has decided that if there is a God I'm going to proclaim myself an atheist in protest of the lack of evidence and lack of care in this world."&lt;/em&gt;} {.atheist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2007/03/outsider-test-for-faith.html"&gt;Outsider Test of Faith&lt;/a&gt;, named by John Loftus, is the following:{.me}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Test your beliefs as if you were an outsider to the faith you are evaluating. If your faith stands up under muster, then you can have your faith. If not, abandon it, for any God who requires you to believe correctly when we have this extremely strong tendency to believe what we were born into, surely should make the correct faith pass the outsider test. If your faith cannot do this, then the God of your faith is not worthy of being worshipped.{.aq} {.atheist}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The test relies on the fact that people tend to believe the things that they were raised with.  In addition, we often have a selection bias, which is that we accept those facts that fit our current beliefs and ignore or discount those that run counter to our current beliefs.  This is one of the reasons we have controlled studies in science, and peer review, and the demand for replicability in science.  We have to make a process to artificially overcome these biases because the biases keep us from finding the truth.  I tell my students to try to be &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; skeptical of claims that support what they already believe, to try to compensate a little bit for the selection bias.{.me}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter - &lt;em class="tq"&gt;"I noticed in your website you say there is a lot of doubt for any supposed historical event.  Now this seems to be an extraordinary degree of skepticism because everything we know is historic, even last week's program."&lt;/em&gt;}{.theist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think that this is hyper-skepticism because it depends on the prior probability for the claim.  Did Socrates exist?  Perhaps.  Did Hitler exist?  Almost certainly.  Did Julius Caesar exist?  Almost certainly, although somewhat less likely than Hitler.  Now you might be thinking that this is hyper-skepticism.  A non-zero probability for Hitler &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; existing?  It is possible that I'm in a Truman Show type environment, in which case every historical thing I have learned is suspect.  I don't think it is likely, but it is possible.  In fact, I think it is so unlikely that I'm willing to consider Hitler and Julius Caesar as historical facts, but I am not willing to consider Socrates or Jesus as historical facts.  But let me stress something at this point - each and every example I've used in this paragraph was for the existence of a person, something which has a decently high prior probability, and definitely does not violate any physical laws or anything like that.  The second you introduce claims like, "Person A was raised from the dead", it doesn't matter much if it was 2000 years ago or &lt;a href="http://www.saibaba.ws/miracles/raisingfromthedead.htm"&gt;40 years ago&lt;/a&gt;.  The more recent claim is more likely, but not so much that I would take it seriously.  Everything comes down to probability.{.me}&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Unbelievable Project"></category><category term="unbelievable"></category><category term="creation"></category><category term="science"></category><category term="harmonization"></category><category term="skeptic"></category></entry><entry><title>Can Science Explain Everything?</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2023/Nov/15/can-science-explain-everything/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-11-15T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-11-15T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2023-11-15:/posts/2023/Nov/15/can-science-explain-everything/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Can science explain everything?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class="theist"&gt;Justin Brierley - Christian Moderator &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="theist"&gt;John Lennox  - Christian&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="atheist"&gt;Peter Atkins - Atheist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="me"&gt;Comments by myself, bblais&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;My short answer is yes (sort of).  Along the way we see John playing a little loosely with the language, using equivocation fallacies, making distinctions where none exist, and being credulous in the face of ancient history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class="theist"&gt;John - We all have faith. Atheists have faith. We all have our beliefs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;Here John is seemingly equating the word "believe" with "faith" even though I’m sure he knows they are different in some important ways. It really doesn’t matter that different people have different beliefs in this discussion. What matters is how we &lt;em&gt;justify&lt;/em&gt; those points and the process of science is the only way we know of to verify claims in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;As for whether science can explain everything I would say "I don’t know". There may be limits but we haven’t yet seen those limits. There have been people in the past who have said that certain things were impossible to measure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the subject of stars, all investigations which are not ultimately reducible to simple visual observations are ... necessarily denied to us. While we can conceive of the possibility of determining their shapes, their sizes, and their motions, we shall never be able by any means to study their chemical composition or their mineralogical structure ... Our knowledge concerning their gaseous envelopes is necessarily limited to their existence, size ... and refractive power, we shall not at all be able to determine their chemical composition or even their density... I regard any notion concerning the true mean temperature of the various stars as forever denied to us. - &lt;a href="http://www.faculty.virginia.edu/rwoclass/astr1210/comte.html"&gt;August Compte, 1835, &lt;em&gt;Cours de la Philosophie Positive&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In "LENS-LIKE ACTION OF A STAR BY THE DEVIATION OF LIGHT IN THE GRAVITATIONAL FIELD", "There is no hope of observing this phenomenon directly" - &lt;a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/84/2188/506"&gt;Einstein, 1936, &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;As a result of many such examples, I would be reticent to say that it is &lt;em&gt;impossible&lt;/em&gt; for science to explain everything. Once you say it is impossible or you give "magic" as an explanation then all explanation stops - you have a self-imposed limit. This happened to Isaac Newton when trying to describe the stability of the solar system -- &lt;a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Stability_of_the_solar_system#Introduction"&gt;Newton resorted to "God did it"&lt;/a&gt;.  The actual solution &lt;a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Stability_of_the_solar_system#Laplace-Lagrange_stability_of_the_Solar_System"&gt;took until Laplace&lt;/a&gt; to be found - even though there was nothing in this solution beyond the abilities of Newton. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;I like Peter‘s response about the public nature of the discoveries of science:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class="aq"&gt;Knowledge that can be shared. Evidence that can be shared publicly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class="aq"&gt;Peter says that scientific ideas sit in a network in relation to each other with hierarchical levels of complexity, e.g. biology, chemistry, and physics. Where they overlap they are mutually supportive which is good evidence that they are true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="aq"&gt;Peter also distinguishes between two types of questions what he calls "stupid" questions and "real" questions. Stupid questions are questions for which there is no evidence and science can dismiss immediately. Examples include &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class="aq"&gt;what is the purpose of the universe?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="aq"&gt;what is the nature of the afterlife?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class="aq"&gt;Real questions can include things like "why is there something rather than nothing" because there is evidence of something.  "What is the nature of consciousness?" because there is evidence of consciousness. These are questions that science can answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;I'd probably phrase it that science deals with &lt;em&gt;well-defined problems&lt;/em&gt;, without hidden agendas in the questions themselves.  The question "what is the nature of the afterlife?" may have a hidden agenda - assuming there is an "after" to "life" - and so is either not well-defined or requires the answer to the question of the nature of life and consciousness first.  The same goes for the "purpose" of the universe - one has to establish that there could even be such a thing, that the words actually mean what we think they mean when applied to objects like entire universes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;John likes to make a distinction between the natural sciences and the historical sciences but I don’t see why that distinction should exist. The distinction is just a matter of the type of data and the level of uncertainty but the reasoning processes are the same. Both the natural sciences and the historical sciences use the methods of prediction, applied probability theory, and falsification.  John further said that his Christianity is "evidence-based" yet he seems to believe that the Christian claims and explanations are not addressable by science.  In a way he has to do this, even though it is equivocating on the notion of "evidence".  He can't admit that his belief is not based on evidence, but it is clear that his claims are not supported by science.  Rather than admit that his beliefs are unjustified, John needs to distance himself from science on these issues.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;Perhaps another way to think of this, and to demonstrate the problem with John's thinking, is to go back to Peter’s idea of a network of ideas.  Claims about the resurrection are based on historical evidence but where that evidence overlaps with the physical sciences and biological sciences (not to mention anthropology and archaeology) you find that it leads to contradictions and not mutual support.  In order to be justified, the different levels of explanation cannot be in conflict with each other and must support each other.  Bringing in John's analogy (described below), there is nothing conflicting between saying that water boils due to heat and the water in the kettle is boiling because I wanted tea.  However, there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; something conflicting between saying that entropy increases in a closed system and a body is resurrected after 3 days.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class="theist"&gt;John thinks that science cannot answer questions such as "Where do I come from?", "Where am I going?", and "What is the meaning of life?" and he says that we have to go to religion and philosophy to answer them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;I’ve written before (&lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Jan/21/philosophy-and-science-whats-the-difference/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2017/Mar/03/philosophy-of-science-and-the-burden-of-proof/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2016/Jan/11/philosophy-and-science/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) about the value (or lack thereof) of philosophical answers to things. Since science has a method for distinguishing true from false claims we can both trust it and know &lt;em&gt;how far&lt;/em&gt; we can trust it.  Religion doesn’t have that - it has no methodology for us to distinguish true or false claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;As for the question "where do we come from?" I think science has given a far better story than any religion. Sure, you can always push the time back to before our understanding of it but if you think about the religious answers to these questions they’re all really parochial. The Bible speaks of one world. It never speaks about multiple worlds or universes. It gives no indication about the time-scales that life developed or that the universe developed, or even that the planets developed. &lt;em&gt;Everything&lt;/em&gt; that we are confident in we have learned from science and not from religion. What about the question "Where we going?" Again science points in the only directions that make sense. Knowing that processes like life, flames, and other dynamical systems will come to an end at some point eliminates most simplistic ideas of an afterlife.  Carolyn Porco &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUpM30B1vJg&amp;amp;list=PL64B250DFF80E579D"&gt;does a great job describing the story that is science&lt;/a&gt;, including musing on what happens when we die.  In contrast the religious story I find to be fanciful and unsupported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;Continuing on with John's confidence in his beliefs, if the best piece of evidence for Christianity is the resurrection then that is pretty weak. The only evidence we have for the resurrection comes from texts written &lt;em&gt;decades&lt;/em&gt; afterward from &lt;em&gt;unknown&lt;/em&gt; authors. Contrast that with anything else we have even a modest degree of confidence in.  Every time I look for the best evidence for nearly &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; else I always find evidence far better than that being claimed for the resurrection.  &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2011/Nov/29/best-evidence-for/"&gt;Try it yourself some time!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;John spends some time on the notion of explanations: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class="theist"&gt;Even when we say science explains, often it doesn't explain comprehensively.  How would you explain boiling water?  You could explain it through heat conduction and agitation of molecules of water.  You can also say that the water is boiling because I'd like a cup of tea.  Now those two explanations are very different, they don't conflict - they complement.  One is the natural scientific explanation and the other is an explanation  in terms of the intention and purposes of an agent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;The problem I think here is with the question - English is a language poorly suited to clarity. For example, there is the question of "why does water &lt;em&gt;in general&lt;/em&gt; boil?" and the question of "why &lt;em&gt;is this particular pot of water&lt;/em&gt; boiling at this moment?" I think what John is trying to get at is the idea that you can explain things on many different levels of detail.  But John is also talking about the role of agency in scientific explanations. Can scientific explanations include agency?  Of course they can -- just look at fields like archaeology or anthropology or even in biology.   If you’re looking at the development of tools or maybe even the building of dams by beavers, we can ask how they were made physically, what purpose they serve from an evolutionary point of view, how the structure of the tool or dam is related to the physical structure of the agent, etc...  However, it is up to the person claiming that an agent exists to give the evidence for its in the first place.   One also has to be clear about &lt;em&gt;which&lt;/em&gt; question one is trying to address. "How would you explain boiling water?" is an underspecified question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;John claims that God can interject arbitrary events into the universe and yet John doesn’t call this a violation of natural law.  He seems to think that it goes &lt;em&gt;beyond&lt;/em&gt; natural law.  Of course you can make the claim that there is an agent that is somehow able to interject things that &lt;em&gt;appear&lt;/em&gt; on the face of it to be contradictions in natural law but it is still an unconvincing claim unless you can demonstrate that the agent actually exists!  We have many people in the past who have claimed violations of natural law (e.g. perpetual motion machines) but these claims have no actual evidential support - not a single one.  It's gotten so bad that the US patent office - which doesn't require a patent idea to even work - refuses to even &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; at such claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;So, if you are going to say (for whatever process) that you have evidence for the violation of the second law of thermodynamics (e.g a perpetual motion machine or a resurrection) then you need to have evidence that would be strong enough to convince physicists.  Historical evidence can &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; rise to this level.  There have been many claims in the past that have suggested a violation of the known physical laws at the time - (e.g. cold fusion, faster than light travel, etc...) - yet even these had evidence far stronger than simply historical evidence.  Scientists are open to such possibilities but the bar has to be set high because most claims are simply false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;I would add further that I don't really care whether God did it or aliens or some other mechanism until I am presented with enough evidence to see if there is even anything of interest to look at.  It is premature to talk about how aliens might have gotten to Earth or what they look like until there is at least some credible evidence that UFOs are alien spacecraft or that alien technology is verified.   With the resurrection, there isn't enough evidence to even be confident there is an effect to be studied, let alone to pin down a mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;I often wonder why Christians are convinced by this sort of evidence.   When I have brought up the common knowledge that the  documents are written many years after the event, that it’s questionable whether we have &lt;em&gt;any understanding&lt;/em&gt; of their authorship, and that we have no idea whether they were even eyewitnesses or at least have access to eye witnesses the common responses I've gotten are that this is common in all of ancient history or that you shouldn’t expect historical documents to be like scientific documents.  I agree with that!  But that should make one &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; confident in the conclusions not more confident.  We should require the levels of￼ evidence that would convince us &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt;.  I don’t really care if that's impossible with ancient documents - that's on God, as far as I can tell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;Concerning natural law, I find it interesting that John says the resurrection is not a violation of natural law because the lawmaker is doing it.  Here, I think we have a problem with wording.  What we call "natural law" is the observed regularity of nature. Perhaps we find that certain regularities are never observed to be violated under every possible measurement that we have ever made.  Even there we could be wrong.  For example, when scientists were first talking about quantum mechanics or relativity they found that there were regularities which were never violated in &lt;em&gt;everyday&lt;/em&gt; life but are violated under certain circumstances (e.g. very small or very fast).  Of course, those circumstances were experimentally determined multiple times such that we could - like Hume - say that it would be more likely that the law we thought originally was correct needed adjusting rather than these new experiments were all (consistently) in error.  For a resurrection, I would expect nothing less.  The probability of a resurrection happening via natural causes is of course astronomical.  Even if one grants unknown causes, the probability is still astronomical until you can demonstrate that the unknown cause is so likely as to overturn the astronomically small probabilities of the claimed event.  Again, historical evidence or philosophical arguments just don't ever rise to this level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="theist"&gt;John reads the book of Genesis where Adam is commanded to name the animals and states that this is the beginnings of the science of taxonomy.  Further, he states that in the beginning there was the Word, and DNA is also a language, so the explanations are again complementary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;This to me is reading into the text what you want to see.  An easy way to see this is to ask the question the other way - were the early biblical writers able to take their text and use it as a guide to find explanations for things like DNA and evolution and cosmology?  Since all of these concepts took hundreds to thousands of years to develop, with no clear advantage given by the content of the Bible, this seems to me good evidence for post-hoc rationalization.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="theist"&gt;John asks his atheist friends whether they would trust a computer if it was "the result of a mindless unguided process" and he always got the answer "No".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;I would give the answer "maybe" -- it would depend on how the process was set up. It could very easily be that you could set up an evolutionary framework that would result in a computational structure that would be able to solve problems in its environment.   I see no reason why that couldn’t happen now, even if it’s a little hard to do with silicon just because of the physics.  I think John feels that "unguided" must in some way be related to "random" and thus untrustworthy.  As an analogy to see the difference, if I place a marble on the edge of a bowl - anywhere on the edge - it will eventually (unguided by agency) make it to the bottom of the bowl in the same spot.  Following the laws of nature does not lead to randomness and chaos and could (given a complex enough system) lead to trustworthy computational structures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;John talks several times about the "atheist worldview". This is clearly something he should have learned by now: atheism isn't a worldview. You could talk about a naturalistic worldview but you can’t talk about an atheist worldview.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="tq"&gt;According to John, he wants to have a worldview that is big enough to live for and to live in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;This strikes me as an &lt;em&gt;emotional&lt;/em&gt; response, perhaps the need to feel more important, to feel tied to something bigger than he is and something that is not mindless.  I typically follow the advice that if you ascribe &lt;em&gt;psychological&lt;/em&gt; reasons for someone else's beliefs while ascribing &lt;em&gt;logical&lt;/em&gt; reasons for your own then you’ve lost the argument. Here John seems to be admitting it explicitly so I don't have a problem drawing it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;To sum up, across the entire debate it is clear that John is credulous about the ancient documents, misuses terminology, and shows sloppy thinking and speaking.  He leans on anecdotal evidence, selectively chooses those parts of the data that support his religious views and doesn't seem to see the proper use of scientific and rational thinking to address claims.  Some of these are so astonishing (like his seeming confidence in conversion stories) that it is hard to imagine how he could think this way and be taken seriously.  Although a pleasant debater, I have never been swayed by any of John Lennox's arguments.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Unbelievable Project"></category><category term="unbelievable"></category></entry><entry><title>Top Reasons for Belief</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2018/Mar/05/top-reasons-for-belief/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-03-05T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-03-05T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2018-03-05:/posts/2018/Mar/05/top-reasons-for-belief/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://www.premierchristianradio.com/Shows/Saturday/Unbelievable/"&gt;Unbelievable podcast&lt;/a&gt; episode &lt;a href="https://www.premierchristianradio.com/Shows/Saturday/Unbelievable/Episodes/Unbelievable-27-Oct-2007-Top-reasons-for-belief"&gt;27 Oct 2007 - Top reasons for belief&lt;/a&gt; there is a discussion around the results of a small survey of reasons for belief in God and …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://www.premierchristianradio.com/Shows/Saturday/Unbelievable/"&gt;Unbelievable podcast&lt;/a&gt; episode &lt;a href="https://www.premierchristianradio.com/Shows/Saturday/Unbelievable/Episodes/Unbelievable-27-Oct-2007-Top-reasons-for-belief"&gt;27 Oct 2007 - Top reasons for belief&lt;/a&gt; there is a discussion around the results of a small survey of reasons for belief in God and belief in Christianity specifically.  They discussed the tension between analytical justifications and those based on revelation or personal experience.  It was interesting that they never addressed the fact that personal experience is an unreliable way of determining the &lt;em&gt;truth&lt;/em&gt; of a proposition.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they did discuss reasons, the usual suspects came up - arguments from first cause, morality, and design.  I was however struck by the conviction that these arguments were basically unassailable.  For example, one Reverend summarized the first cause argument.  “Everything that begins to exist has a cause” - which he added “was a matter of logic and can be proved and thus is uncontroversial.”  He followed with “the universe began to exist.” to which he added “of course that’s true because the universe is here.”  He then expressed his admiration that this argument was written hundreds of years ago.  What I find interesting is not that someone would believe this argument, but that they would so uncritically accept it - the universe existing does not necessarily imply that it &lt;em&gt;began&lt;/em&gt; to exist.  Just because your common sense suggests that everything that begins to exist has a cause doesn’t mean that your common sense should hold for things outside of your own personal scale - things may be quite different and unintuitive on the scale of the very big or very small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discussion did mention the &lt;em&gt;practical&lt;/em&gt; benefit of Christian belief, in the specific case of forgiveness taking away bitterness.  This may in fact be true, but can’t one achieve this without believing all of the other parts?  I think so, but sometimes I wonder whether people need a form of narrative to structure their most fundamental beliefs - a human limitation perhaps - and that this narrative could be a requirement to get the levels of positive behaviors we’d like out of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Unbelievable Project"></category><category term="unbelievable"></category><category term="religion"></category></entry><entry><title>Will the Sun Rise Tomorrow?</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Sep/22/will-the-sun-rise-tomorrow/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-09-22T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2014-09-22T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2014-09-22:/posts/2014/Sep/22/will-the-sun-rise-tomorrow/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;On a recent &lt;a href="http://www.premierchristianradio.com/shows/saturday/unbelievable.aspx"&gt;Unbelievable podcast&lt;/a&gt; there is a discussion between  &lt;a href="http://www.premierchristianradio.com/Shows/Saturday/Unbelievable/Episodes/Unbelievable-Is-our-universe-more-likely-on-atheism-or-theism-Calum-Miller-vs-James-Croft"&gt;Calum Miller and James Croft&lt;/a&gt; on the topic "is our universe more likely on atheism or theism?", where Calum introduces …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On a recent &lt;a href="http://www.premierchristianradio.com/shows/saturday/unbelievable.aspx"&gt;Unbelievable podcast&lt;/a&gt; there is a discussion between  &lt;a href="http://www.premierchristianradio.com/Shows/Saturday/Unbelievable/Episodes/Unbelievable-Is-our-universe-more-likely-on-atheism-or-theism-Calum-Miller-vs-James-Croft"&gt;Calum Miller and James Croft&lt;/a&gt; on the topic "is our universe more likely on atheism or theism?", where Calum introduces probabilistic arguments throughout.  At one point he brings up evidence for the sun coming up, as an example of knowledge claims and models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="calum-describes-hume"&gt;Calum describes Hume&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calum - "Hume basically noted that we don't have any non-circular justification for thinking that the universe will be regular, that it will continue to be regular in the future. [...] He doesn't just say that we have to be a bit unsure that the sun will rise tomorrow, he says that we have no good reason at all for thinking the sun will rise tomorrow.  The most common justification that the sun will rise tomorrow is that it has risen every day  in the past.  But then if you compare two theories, one says that the sun rises everyday in the past and in the future and the other theory says that the sun rises everyday in the past but won't rise tomorrow.  Both those theories predict the observations we already have, both those theories lead us to expect the observations, and so the observations we currently have don't distinguish between these two theories.  And yet one of those theories predicts the sun will rise tomorrow and one of them predicts that the sun won't rise tomorrow.  So, even though we have those observations, they don't really do an obviously good job of determining which of these theories is true.  [...]  He is saying that the past observations don't give us that good reason for thinking that the sun will rise tomorrow.  This is the Problem of Induction and has perplexed philosophers for centuries."{.tq}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-does-hume-actually-say-about-the-sun-rising"&gt;What does Hume &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; say about the Sun rising?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/en/hume.htm"&gt;Hume writes&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matters of fact, which are the second objects of human reason, are not ascertained in the same manner; nor is our evidence of their truth, however great, of a like nature with the foregoing. The contrary of every matter of fact is still possible, because it can never imply a contradiction, and is conceived by the mind with the same facility and distinctness, as if ever so conformable to reality. That the sun will not rise tomorrow is no less intelligible a proposition, and implies no more contradiction, than the affirmation, that it will rise. We should in vain, therefore, attempt to demonstrate its falsehood. Were it demonstratively false, it would imply a contradiction, and could never be distinctly conceived by the mind. An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding (1772). Hackett Publ Co. 1993; Chapter on Cause and Effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here Hume is essentially stating that all propositions have a non-zero probability (however small they might be) unless they are &lt;em&gt;logically&lt;/em&gt; impossible.  This is not saying, at all, that we have no good reason to believe the sun will rise tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bread, which I formerly ate, nourished me: that is, a body of such sensible qualities was, at that time, endued with such secret powers; but does it follow, that other bread must also nourish me at another time, and that like sensible qualities must always be attended with like secret powers? The consequence seems nowise necessary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, although Hume predates probability theory, this is essentially what he is saying - the consequence is not logically &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; (i.e. &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;P&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo stretchy="false"&gt;(&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi mathvariant="normal"&gt;c&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi mathvariant="normal"&gt;o&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi mathvariant="normal"&gt;n&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi mathvariant="normal"&gt;s&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi mathvariant="normal"&gt;e&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi mathvariant="normal"&gt;q&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi mathvariant="normal"&gt;u&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi mathvariant="normal"&gt;e&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi mathvariant="normal"&gt;n&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi mathvariant="normal"&gt;c&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi mathvariant="normal"&gt;e&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;mi mathvariant="normal"&gt;∣&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi mathvariant="normal"&gt;o&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi mathvariant="normal"&gt;b&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi mathvariant="normal"&gt;s&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi mathvariant="normal"&gt;e&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi mathvariant="normal"&gt;r&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi mathvariant="normal"&gt;v&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi mathvariant="normal"&gt;a&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi mathvariant="normal"&gt;t&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi mathvariant="normal"&gt;i&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi mathvariant="normal"&gt;o&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi mathvariant="normal"&gt;n&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi mathvariant="normal"&gt;s&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;mo stretchy="false"&gt;)&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mo&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mn&gt;1&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex"&gt;P({\rm consequence}|{\rm observations})&amp;lt;1&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.13889em;"&gt;P&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mopen"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathrm"&gt;consequence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;∣&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathrm"&gt;observations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mclose"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mrel"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut" style="height:0.6444em;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;).  We see this as a direct application of probability theory,  a totally uncontroversial application at that.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fail to see that the "problem" of induction is really a problem.  I also fail to see Hume claiming that there is no good reason to see the consequence following from the the observations, just that he doesn't see one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The connection between these propositions is not intuitive. There is required a medium, which may enable the mind to draw such an inference, if indeed it be drawn by reasoning and argument. What that medium is, I must confess, passes my comprehension, and it is incumbent on those to produce it, who assert that it really exists, and is the origin of all our conclusions concerning matter of fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The medium Hume refers to is simply the calculus of probability, something which post-dates Hume's writings.  Hume was being honest that he didn't see a way, and he did not claim that there was no possible way - that would be an argument from ignorance.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-does-laplace-say-about-the-sun-rising"&gt;What does Laplace say about the Sun rising?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we have probability theory, then we can actually do some simple calculations concerning the probability of the sun rising tomorrow.  Of course these calculations are not a complete description of the problem, but give the flavor of it.  Laplace used the sunrise problem as an example application of his Rule of Succession, which itself is derived from the rules of probability.  The calculation goes something like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our model is that the sun rises with unknown probability &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;p&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex"&gt;p&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut" style="height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Given complete ignorance of &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;p&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex"&gt;p&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut" style="height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; we assume an initial uniform probability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sun has risen every day for the written record, say, 10000 years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the probability for rising tomorrow, which is also the mean value of &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;p&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex"&gt;p&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut" style="height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; over the posterior, is given by the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_succession"&gt;Rule of Succession&lt;/a&gt; (also known as the "assume one success and one failure"):

&amp;amp;=&amp;amp; \frac{10000 {\rm yr}\times 365 {\rm d}/{\rm yr}+1}{10000 {\rm yr}\times 365 {\rm d}/{\rm yr}+2}\\
&amp;amp;=&amp;amp;0.9999997
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_succession#Mathematical_details"&gt;gets messier&lt;/a&gt; when you can't even assume that both a failure and a success are possible, but it &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_succession#Mathematical_details"&gt;can still be done&lt;/a&gt; without any change to the qualitative result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly we have quite good reasons to believe the that sun will rise tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="two-theories"&gt;Two theories&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We go back to Calum's two theories: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you compare two theories, one says that the sun rises everyday in the past and in the future and the other theory says that the sun rises everyday in the past but won't rise tomorrow.  Both those theories predict the observations we already have, both those theories lead us to expect the observations, and so the observations we currently have don't distinguish between these two theories.{.tq}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The situation for arguing a high probability of tomorrow's sun rise is far more compelling, however, because our information is not simply that the sun has risen in the past, but includes observations of the patterns of the seasons, the predictions of the phases of the moon and Venus, and a whole host of other factors which significantly increase the chance the sun will rise.  Laplace knew this well, and was using this example not as a serious calculation, but as a pedagogical example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a consequence, both of Calum's so-called theories do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; predict the observations we already have - only one of them does.  Even if we accept just the observations for which both theories are consistent in the past, one has to view this two-theory perspective from the point of prediction.  It's now tomorrow, and "Theory B" doesn't work - so we modify it to say the sun won't rise &lt;em&gt;tomorrow&lt;/em&gt; (the new tomorrow).  That next day comes with a sunrise, and this "Theory B 2.0" is wrong (again) and has to be modified (again).  It is clear that "Theory B" fails, and we should be less confident in it.  That's why, in science, it isn't nearly enough to be consistent with past data - one must make predictions, not just post-dictions, and test it.  It is often trivial to come up with "explanations" for data we already have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusions"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that the so-called "Problem of Induction" was solved centuries ago, with the advent of probability theory, and all such hand-wringing seems to be only for philosophers.  In the sciences, these challenges to induction just aren't taken seriously.   I'll sleep soundly tonight with the confident knowledge that the sun will rise again tomorrow, despite the protestations of philosophers.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Unbelievable Project"></category></entry><entry><title>Theism vs Atheism</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Sep/18/theism-vs-atheism/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-09-18T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2014-09-18T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2014-09-18:/posts/2014/Sep/18/theism-vs-atheism/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;On a recent &lt;a href="http://www.premierchristianradio.com/shows/saturday/unbelievable.aspx"&gt;Unbelievable podcast&lt;/a&gt; there is a discussion between  &lt;a href="http://www.premierchristianradio.com/Shows/Saturday/Unbelievable/Episodes/Unbelievable-Is-our-universe-more-likely-on-atheism-or-theism-Calum-Miller-vs-James-Croft"&gt;Calum Miller and James Croft&lt;/a&gt; on the topic "is our universe more likely on atheism or theism?", where Calum introduces …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On a recent &lt;a href="http://www.premierchristianradio.com/shows/saturday/unbelievable.aspx"&gt;Unbelievable podcast&lt;/a&gt; there is a discussion between  &lt;a href="http://www.premierchristianradio.com/Shows/Saturday/Unbelievable/Episodes/Unbelievable-Is-our-universe-more-likely-on-atheism-or-theism-Calum-Miller-vs-James-Croft"&gt;Calum Miller and James Croft&lt;/a&gt; on the topic "is our universe more likely on atheism or theism?", where Calum introduces probabilistic arguments throughout.  Although James does a good job of pressing Calum's arguments in weak points, and framing the argument in a more coherent way, I think there is much more to be said about the weaknesses of this particular argument, and the framing of these problems in terms of probability.  There is a danger in this sort of thing of using mathemtics to give the veneer of authenticity to an argument that is riddled with random guesses, ill-defined concepts, and unsupported premises.  Let's start with some quotes from the episode, so we can see where this is going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-argument"&gt;The Argument&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calum - "I think one useful way of thinking about is is to consider what evidence is in general.  When we think about evidence for a theory, in this case the theory is that God exists - we want to explain some features of the world, we look for things (observations) which are surprising if the theory isn't true but which aren't that surprising if the theory is true."{.tq}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calum then goes on to do an analogy with fingerprints on a murder weapon.  And then points out the observation that he believes is evidence for God. {.theist}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calum - "There are a number of arguments that work this way.  But one of the partiular pieces of evidence that I want to discuss today is that the world exhibits a real kind of regularity and there are basic laws, science works, that we can understand the world.  For all we know, the universe could have been chaotic, might not have been any laws at all, we might not have been able to do science - it might have been complete chaos. "{.tq}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here he's describing the form of the argument, as it might apply to the sun rising.{.theist}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calum - "Even more basic things that we use scientific reasoning for, but do not always strike us as scientific truth.  For example, &lt;em&gt;'the sun will rise tomorrow'&lt;/em&gt;.  Most of us believe that.  This is a common-sense inference from our observations.  On atheism to expect that regularity, for the sun could just fail to rise tomorrow, but on theism we can expect that kind of regularity because God set it in place. [...]  That's just one example, and you'd need a lot more for the full argument."{.tq}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He finishes by describing how moral responsibility hinges on this regularity, because I need to know the likely effect of my actions on others in order to make moral decisions and be responsible for them.  If things were chaotic, if my actions had random effects, then moral responsibility could not work.{.theist}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-problem-with-the-math-posteriors-vs-likelihoods"&gt;The problem with the math - posteriors vs likelihoods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first problem that struck me was that, from a math point of view, he is simply doing a likelihood ratio:
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{P({\rm data}|{\rm theism})}{P({\rm data}|{\rm atheism})}
\end{eqnarray}
and saying that this is greater than one, and thus theism is more likely.  That is just the wrong question to ask.  What we really want to look at, even keeping the same structure, is the ratio of the &lt;em&gt;posterior&lt;/em&gt; probabilities, or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{P({\rm theism}|{\rm data})}{P({\rm atheism}|{\rm data})}
\end{eqnarray}
which is related to the likelihood ratio through Bayes' theorem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{P({\rm theism}|{\rm data})}{P({\rm atheism}|{\rm data})} &amp;amp;=&amp;amp; \frac{P({\rm data}|{\rm theism})}{P({\rm data}|{\rm atheism})} \times \frac{P({\rm theism})}{P({\rm atheism})}
\end{eqnarray}
where we factor in the &lt;em&gt;prior&lt;/em&gt; probabilities.  Already, we have an issue, because the prior probability for the universe with an extra agent should be smaller than one without such an agent.  If you factor in the an agent with many specific properties, then this is smaller still.  By omitting this part, you could argue for anything.  For example, 
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{P({\rm data}|{\rm fairies})}{P({\rm data}|{\rm no-fairies})}&amp;gt;1
\end{eqnarray}
or the regularity of the universe is much more likely given fairies than no-fairies, so that is evidence for the fairies.  Even if true, it is clearly an uninteresting and unuseful claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-problem-with-the-premise-regarding-theism"&gt;The problem with the premise regarding theism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next problem that struck me was that it seemed that Calum was trying to sneak in many more details into his theism than his argument would warrant.  He needs to &lt;em&gt;define&lt;/em&gt; what he means by theism to state that it is more likely to result in a regular universe.  For example, a number of counter examples can be made:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Under the Greek pantheon, it is more likely that things would be chaotic, at the will of capricious deities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gods or divine beings, such as Cthulhu, revel in chaos and thus would make it less likely to result in a regular universe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when Calum says "theism", what he seems to mean is the existence of "order-making Gods", but then his argument is circular:  a regular universe is more likely under a regular-universe-making God hypothesis than not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-problem-with-the-premise-regarding-atheism"&gt;The problem with the premise regarding atheism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, Calum never supports (and James reiterates this many times) that it is unlikely to have an ordered universe under atheism.  "For all we know, the universe could be chaotic", Calum says.  However, that needs to be &lt;em&gt;demonstrated&lt;/em&gt;, not asserted, or it is an argument from ignorance in disguise.  It is possible, and in fact cosmology seems to be pointing more in this direction, that the universe could not be any other way - that the regularity is the result of the production of any universe, and further that the production of universes is the only stable solution.  The notion of philosophical "nothing" may be physically unstable and thus unlikely to ever exist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="concluding-thoughts"&gt;Concluding thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find Calum's introduction of morality to the argument adds nothing, and only serves as a red herring.  Without some regularity in the universe, even thought itself would be impossible .  We couldn't even have the idea of a "being", or an animal, or life without regularity.  Thus, our mere existence requires regularity - but one that need not be imposed from the outside, with a God.  Introducing the notion of a generic theism causes more problems to the argument than it solves, because it includes Zeus and Cthulhu.  Circularity results when restricting the relevant theism to exclude these possibilities.  Even if Calum solved this, the basic set-up of the problem is answering the wrong question, and is at best an uninteresting and useless result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is more to this episode, which I'll address later, but these objections are enough to derail the entire argument Calum makes.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Unbelievable Project"></category></entry><entry><title>Is Faith the Same as Trust or Baseless Belief?</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Jul/28/is-faith-the-same-as-trust-or-baseless-belief/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-07-28T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2014-07-28T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2014-07-28:/posts/2014/Jul/28/is-faith-the-same-as-trust-or-baseless-belief/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was listening to the &lt;a href="http://www.premierradio.org.uk/shows/saturday/unbelievable.aspx"&gt;Unbelievable podcast&lt;/a&gt; debate between &lt;a href="http://www.premierradio.org.uk/listen/ondemand.aspx?mediaid={1D4751A4-7692-48E0-BB9E-CCDBA08C9AE3}"&gt;Tim McGrew and Peter Boghossian&lt;/a&gt; on the definition of faith, and whether it is a valid way of knowing.

I have &lt;a href="http://web.bryant.edu/~bblais/faith-trust-and-evidence.html"&gt;my initial response here&lt;/a&gt;, but want to look at another aspect of it in the current post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter defines faith either as "pretending to know things you do not know" or "belief without evidence."  From the OED we have faith defined as "complete trust or confidence in someone or something". Tim says that very few Christians (less than 1%) would use Peter's definition, with the vast majority using something similar to the OED.  Peter claims that it is just the reverse.  Which is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="research-via-google"&gt;Research via Google&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an informal way, one can do research via google to get an overall sense for how a term is used.  I make no claims this is exhaustive, or even particularly scholarly, but I would wager that if a term is used in less than 1% of the population in a certain way it is unlikely to appear in the first few google results.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I casually googled around, and found a few quotes.  As you can easily verify, I found that the dominant definition does seem to be Tim's, but that the "belief without [sufficient] evidence" occurs more then 1% of the time, but not nearly 50%.  In some of the cases, it is hard to determine which way (or both!) that they are understanding the term.  Obviously a more systematic approach might be useful, but as with nearly all such empirical matters, the case is less black-and-white than proponents or opponents like to portray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two terms I tried were "faith in God", which universally gives Tim's definition in the first page of hits, and "you must have faith", which uses Peter's definition in at least two of the 15 or so top hits.  One of these (http://www.strangenotions.com/do-atheists-have-faith/) says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that the concept of faith can be understood, in many cases, as involving belief without a certain kind or amount of evidence—the kind or amount that would give us certain proof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is entirely equivalent to the "faith = probability" definition of Peter's, and the website author levels this against atheists saying that they have "faith".  Another (http://hopefaithprayer.com/you-cant-believe-until-you-have-faith/) says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believing requires faith, and faith requires the action of believing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which, when you apply to the parachute example makes no sense at all, unless you interpret faith as believing without suffient evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="using-the-word-faith-in-an-argument"&gt;Using the word "faith" in an argument&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it is clear that people do use the term "faith" in both ways, but let's for the moment accept Tim's definition.  "Faith" then should never be used in an argument in any way, especially with people who don't believe in God.  Why is that?  Because, any analysis of utility theory has essentially two components - the probability part, where one has to present evidence for the different possibilities, and the utility part, which places the value on different outcomes.  The atheist hasn't even gotten through the first part, so the utility part is a non-sequitur.  Since faith, under Tim's definition, requires the utility part to have any meaning, then to bring faith into the argument before, or along with, the evidence is simply not useful.  Doing so is much more likely to be interpreted by the atheist as a substitute for evidence, and make people like Peter assume that faith is belief without evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="is-faith-a-way-of-knowing"&gt;Is "faith" a way of knowing?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the question about whether faith is a way of knowing, the answer has to be a clear "No."  Even under Tim's definition, faith is not a way of knowing, but a label we give to the act of weighing the probability and the utility of unlikely (a-priori) possibilities, actions, and outcomes.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let's ditch the word faith, which is a loaded term anyway, and use the word "trust" when we mean "trust" and "evidence" when we mean "evidence".&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Unbelievable Project"></category></entry><entry><title>Faith, Trust, and Evidence</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Jul/24/faith-trust-and-evidence/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-07-24T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2014-07-24T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2014-07-24:/posts/2014/Jul/24/faith-trust-and-evidence/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was listening to the &lt;a href="http://www.premierradio.org.uk/shows/saturday/unbelievable.aspx"&gt;Unbelievable podcast&lt;/a&gt; debate between &lt;a href="http://www.premierradio.org.uk/listen/ondemand.aspx?mediaid={1D4751A4-7692-48E0-BB9E-CCDBA08C9AE3}"&gt;Tim McGrew and Peter Boghossian&lt;/a&gt; on the definition of faith and whether or not faith is a valid way of knowing …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was listening to the &lt;a href="http://www.premierradio.org.uk/shows/saturday/unbelievable.aspx"&gt;Unbelievable podcast&lt;/a&gt; debate between &lt;a href="http://www.premierradio.org.uk/listen/ondemand.aspx?mediaid={1D4751A4-7692-48E0-BB9E-CCDBA08C9AE3}"&gt;Tim McGrew and Peter Boghossian&lt;/a&gt; on the definition of faith and whether or not faith is a valid way of knowing.  In this discussion, Boghossian's main point - that "faith is belief without evidence" or "pretending to know things you do not know" - is derailed quite early and he never truly addresses the counter definition other than to claim that few people use it.  The discussion then devolved into a back and forth with both sides claiming that "all the people I know use my definition", and got nowhere.  Let's look at these definitions, and see where it goes. {.me}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-definitions"&gt;The Definitions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter - "Belief without evidence."{.aq}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter - "Pretending to know things you do not know."{.aq}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OED - "complete trust or confidence in someone or something"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim says that very few Christians (less than 1%) would use Peter's definition{.theist}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree that no Christian would &lt;em&gt;articulate&lt;/em&gt; this definition of faith, however they may be &lt;em&gt;functionally&lt;/em&gt; using it, which we will address later.  Peter really should have said that.{.me}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim - "Faith is trusting in, holding to, and acting on what one has good reason to believe is true in the face of difficulties.  The difficulties may be where you have to take an action where the outcome is beyond your control."{.tq}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The example Tim gives is jumping out of an airplane, where you have faith in your instructor that he packed your parachute properly.  Your act of jumping makes faith more than simply hope (if you just hoped your instructor packed it, you wouldn't jump), and the decision is made in the face of evidence, not despite it or without it.{.me} &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Peter asks Tim what people mean when they accuse someone of having "faith in evolution", Tim responds {.atheist}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're trusting in something that you cannot completely verify because it doesn't lie open to your senses. {.tq}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Peter asks Tim what people mean when they say "I don't have enough faith to be an atheist", Tim responds{.atheist}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Belief in something in the face of certain difficulties, where the weight of the difficulties is greater on one side compared to the other.{.tq}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Peter asks Tim "Why don't we say that we have faith in the existence of chickens?", Tim responds{.atheist}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are venturing nothing on the existence of chickens. When I believe that chickens exist and I act on that belief I am not taking any step that places outcomes I care about beyond my direct control. [In the case of religion], people are placing the outcome of their eternal soul out of their control.  They are taking a risk where the outcomes matter.  The decision itself is evidenced but the outcome is uncertain.{.tq}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Peter asks Tim "Do you have faith or evidence that Islam is false?", Tim responds{.atheist}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why would I use the word "faith" when I am venturing nothing on Islam?  I am a little bit confused about the framing of the question that way.   I think I have evidence that it is false, but since I am not venturing on Islam, I'm not sure why the word faith would come in. {.tq}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="addressing-the-definitions"&gt;Addressing the Definitions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've &lt;a href="http://web.bryant.edu/~bblais/knowledge-faith-and-belief.html"&gt;said this before&lt;/a&gt;, but it bears repeating.  The word &lt;em&gt;faith&lt;/em&gt; conflates two related terms - probability and utility.  &lt;em&gt;Probability&lt;/em&gt; is just the value we assign to the strength of belief, and &lt;em&gt;utility&lt;/em&gt; is the value we assign as the reward (or penalty) we receive when taking an action.  They both have well-defined mathematical relationships and procedures (e.g. Bayes theorem, decision theory, etc...)  A rational actor should try to maximize expected utility.  From &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_theory"&gt;Wikipedia on Decision Theory&lt;/a&gt;,{.me} &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of expected value is that, when faced with a number of actions, each of which could give rise to more than one possible outcome with different probabilities, the rational procedure is to identify all possible outcomes, determine their values (positive or negative) and the probabilities that will result from each course of action, and multiply the two to give an expected value.  The action to be chosen should be the one that gives rise to the highest total expected value.{.me}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly claims using expected utility require that probability assignments have already been made, so claims of utility must necessarily be probability claims as well.  When translated into these more precise terms, both Tim's and Peter's claims begin to make more sense.  It will also show that Tim is in fact using the definition, in some cases, like Peter and is therefore inconsistent.{.me}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have faith in your instructor that he packed your parachute properly.  Your act of jumping makes faith more than simply hope (if you just hoped your instructor packed it, you wouldn't jump), and the decision is made in the face of evidence, not despite it or without it.{.tq}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The equations are:{.me}&lt;/p&gt;

Again, Peter sees the first part, yet ignores the second part.  {.me}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="not-all-is-well-with-tim"&gt;Not all is well with Tim&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going back to this little exchange, we note that Tim is also using Peter's definition:{.me}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Peter asks Tim what people mean when they accuse someone of having "faith in evolution", Tim responds {.atheist}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're trusting in something that you cannot completely verify because it doesn't lie open to your senses. {.tq}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I can think of no way to understand this statement from the perspective of Tim's definition:{.me}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"When I act on that belief I am taking some step that places outcomes I care about beyond my direct control"{.tq}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What outcomes are you placing beyond your control believing in evolution?  What obvious utility are you weighing in this case?  As far as I can see there is none, and so faith is in fact being used here as "belief without sufficient evidence". {.me} &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="priors-and-faith"&gt;Priors and Faith&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this brings in another aspect of faith, which I believe applies to all of the cases explored so far, and that is that faith is used only in contexts with low &lt;em&gt;prior&lt;/em&gt; probability.  In this conversation, they spoke of faith in the context of the supernatural, extreme activities (i.e. jumping out of planes), events beyond our immediate senses - all of which coincide with lower &lt;em&gt;prior&lt;/em&gt; probability, and need &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; evidence than is typical to overcome them.  They may, or may not, also have high utility. We don't have faith in the existence of chickens because the existence of chickens has high &lt;em&gt;prior&lt;/em&gt; probability.  {.me}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-empirical-claim"&gt;The Empirical Claim&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll have to address the empirical question Tim raises in another post.   Is it empirically true, as Tim claims, that less than 1% of the people use the term &lt;em&gt;faith&lt;/em&gt; in the way that Peter defines it (i.e., belief without [sufficient] evidence)? {.me}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in Tim's case, however, I have found he doesn't use it &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the time in the way he claims, and reverts to Peter's definition when convenient.  That is the problem with the word - since it is referring to two distinct components, the apologist can easily switch between them without even noticing themselves.  That's why I don't like using the word, and simply try to address the question, "what do you believe and why?".{.me}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusions"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, Peter does a lousy job and seemed completely unprepared to deal with this rather common understanding of the word faith.  He also insisted on using the "belief without evidence" instead of the more honest "belief without &lt;em&gt;sufficient&lt;/em&gt; evidence".  When people say there is no evidence for something (like God, UFOs, astrology, psychic phenomena, etc...), they really mean that there is terrible evidence for something.  There is &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; evidence for astrology, it's just that it is &lt;em&gt;terrible&lt;/em&gt; evidence.  The exaggerated, more simple, phrase of "belief without evidence" is counterproductive, especially when the more accurate phrase, "belief without &lt;em&gt;sufficient&lt;/em&gt; evidence", is nearly as simple.  {.me}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter does say that by claiming faith, one is "assigning a confidence value to a belief higher than what is warranted by the evidence."  This doesn't roll off the tongue quite as well as "pretending to know things you do not know", and he should have made clear the distinction between the precise language and the slightly hyperbolic simplifications.{.me}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also feel that words like faith are so slippery as to be useless, and in fact dangerous in a debate or discussion.  It is too easy to slide from probability to utility and back when using the word faith.  Although I might advise one to stick to the math, I think the equations are just more concise representations of the statements that could be made in plain English.  {.me}&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Unbelievable Project"></category></entry><entry><title>Do healing miracles happen?</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Jun/03/do-healing-miracles-happen/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-06-03T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2014-06-03T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2014-06-03:/posts/2014/Jun/03/do-healing-miracles-happen/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As part of the &lt;a href="http://web.bryant.edu/~bblais/unbelievable-project-a-non-believers-armchair-perspective-on-six-years-of-christian-debates.html"&gt;Unbelievable Project&lt;/a&gt;, I am taking notes and "arm-chair" responding to each of the &lt;a href="http://www.premierradio.org.uk/shows/saturday/unbelievable.aspx"&gt;Unbelievable podcast&lt;/a&gt; episodes

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full Title: &lt;em&gt;Do healing miracles happen? Robby Dawkins &amp;amp; David Beebee - Unbelievable? - 15 March 2014&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robby Dawkins (not to be confused with Richard) says he regularly sees healing miracles occur for the people he prays for. Cancer is gone, blind eyes see, pain disappears, even a lung was re-grown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Beebee, an atheist sceptic with an interest in the charismatic church interacts with Dawkins and questions why we don't see more convincing proof, and what he does about the 'misses'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also hear from a Christian who is sceptical of modern miracle claims, Dr Peter May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://media.premier.org.uk/unbelievable/b3e2271e-c79d-40c0-b9ba-f2e7a014f6e8.mp3"&gt;Download mp3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class="theist"&gt;Justin Brierley - Christian Moderator &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="theist"&gt;Robby Dawkins  - Christian&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="atheist"&gt;David Beebee - Atheist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="theist"&gt;Dr Peter May -Christian, skeptic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="me"&gt;Comments by myself, bblais&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="notes"&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="theist"&gt;Justin - He starts the conversation by stating that &lt;strong&gt;"miracle stuff"&lt;/strong&gt; is considered a bit &lt;strong&gt;"out there"&lt;/strong&gt;, that it's &lt;strong&gt;"very difficult to verify, it's not objective in the way we can talk about evidence for God and the Bible, and that kind of thing"&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;It's funny how he started off like that.  They steer clear of miracles in this show because it is hard to verify, and not objective evidence for God.  The funny thing about that statement is that it is just totally wrong!  In fact, miracles &lt;em&gt;would be&lt;/em&gt; objective evidence if there &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; a God.  So, if even some miracle claims were verified, they would be trumpeted as the most objective evidence for the existence of God and the claims of the Bible.  The fact Justin Brierley can say that the claims are "not objective" is pretty much an admission that there is no good evidence for miracles and the entire topic should be avoided.  It has disagreeable consequences for the theology if they really have to confront the question  "where did all the miracles go?" - they seem to be common and public in ancient days, yet disappear as our understanding of science improves.   Starting off the show like that is already an admission of failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="theist"&gt;So Robby Dawkins claims he prayed for a guy who was going to have open heart surgery, and that the guy also had half a lung removed in the past due to lung cancer.  The story claims that the surgeon opened him up, and said "This man has the heart of a 30-year old man, and the lungs have regrown".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;That is a &lt;em&gt;fantastic&lt;/em&gt; story.  I don't believe it.  So, the question is, who's right, and should I be that skeptical?  Here is someone giving this story, and I don't have any of the details such as the name of the person, etc... I am going to look this up and I would bet money (I never bet more than a dollar on any bet) , but I'd be willing to bet $1 that this story doesn't pan out.  The reason is that the story is totally ridiculous and fantastic.  If it were true, I would have heard about it before.  If they &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; had medical records of the guy, before and after scans of the heart and lungs, it would be totally trivial to demonstrate this to the satisfaction of pretty much any skeptic.  The fact that I haven't heard about it probably means that it is made up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;The data should be able to sway me from my skepticism, if it is real.  If it is anything like the UFO cases I've read or the other healing cases I've read, it will either:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li class="me"&gt;Not have enough information to verify at all - just the story, with no evidence or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="me"&gt;Turn out to be wrong&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;This has been the case for every miracle claim and UFO claim I have ever taken the time to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;Why would someone make up a story about this?  One is to feel better about the world, another is that it was a mundane story that got distorted over time.  One thing is clear is that Robby Dawkins has a vested interest in this story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="theist"&gt;Then they relay a movie, where Robby Dawkins supposedly heals a young man, Jacob, of neck and back pain.  He prays 3 times over the young man.  The first time the next pain goes down to a "zero", but the back is still at a "seven", the second time the back goes down to a "one", and then down to a "zero" for last prayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;Here we have a crowd around the young man during the prayer, and a completely subjective reporting of pain.  Don't you think there is significant social pressure on this young man to claim more pain loss than he actually experiences?  Robby Dawkins, in the clip, jokes with the young man "you're not just being nice to me, are you?" What is he supposed to say to that?  This is the problem with "healing" pain this way - there is nothing objective to measure, no way to test if there is in fact an effect.  Is it more likely that the young man is lying, or perhaps distorting due to the social pressures, than he's actually healed?  Absolutely.  In order to test this, one would have to have an objective way to verify, which is not presented. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;I'm reminded again of the website &lt;a href="http://whywontgodhealamputees.com/"&gt;http://whywontgodhealamputees.com/&lt;/a&gt;.  Sure, God can heal these vague issues like my back pain this hour, but can't seem to heal anything tangible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="theist"&gt;He finishes his miracle healing by asking the young man to touch his toes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;Now this is a somewhat objective measure, rather than the 0-10 pain scale, which may reflect objective evidence of an improvement from the prayer.  If he couldn't touch his toes before, because of the pain, and now he can then that would be at least some evidence (not convincing, but some) toward the efficacy of the prayer.  Could the young man touch his toes afterward?  No.  What did Robby Dawkins do?  He made a joke about it - "That's about as far as I could do".  I have to wonder, if it had come out a different way what would the response have been? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;This is emblematic of the approach of unskeptical people.  You do a test that you think might point in the right direction (generally not done very carefully), but you design the test so that you win either way.  If it works, then it's a miracle, and if it doesn't then it is shrugged off as something the person needs to work on, you shouldn't have passed the test anyway, etc...  Essentially a rationalization.  Heads, I win. Tails, you lose.  Perhaps another test is done that shows some mild improvement from before, and that is touted as the evidence while the counter examples are quietly ignored.  Selective bias, completely unskeptical.  There is nothing miraculous about any of the things Robby Dawkins actually demonstrated in these examples.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;One could claim I'm being hyperskeptic, and yes, I am being skeptical.  I am demanding that if you make a claim that violates my understanding of the laws of physics, and the way the universe works, then you had better pony up an equivalent amount of evidence that the people who established those laws of physics did in the first place.  You should be able to convince the skeptics, because that is exactly what the scientists have done to get us here.  They have taken things where people were skeptical, such as germ theory of disease, plate tectonics, big bang cosmology, etc... and provided testable predictions that were borne out, especially when unintuitive.  In the germ theory of disease, something as simple as washing your hands should reduce infection - which is demonstrably does.  This would be very difficult to explain if you believed disease were some kind of spiritual phenomenon (which was once believed) or an imbalance in the humors, or some kind of energy imbalance.  This is before even having a microscope to confirm the small living beings called germs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;We don't need to understand how miracles occur to verify that they occur, so it is not an argument against the skeptic to accuse them of a naturalistic bias.  It is not a bad thing to be skeptical.  It keeps you from being taken in by false claims, from falling victim to selection bias, etc...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="tq"&gt;Robby - "Some people would say that they felt better, but I found out later that they still had some pain.  I found out that this girl that had scoliosis, her shoulders were severely tilted, said "It is better", but I could see that her shoulders were not 100% straight.  And I would be like, I need to get a number from them because I'm not getting a clear answer."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;So he's trying to be more quantitative, which is a good thing, it's still not any better than what it was before.  This is not a controlled setting, there is a serious vested interest for the child to say that they are feeling better, and there is no way to independently verify that they are in fact getting better in the cases that he is talking about.  It is still a subjective claim, while &lt;em&gt;sounding&lt;/em&gt; more quantitative with the number. It makes it &lt;em&gt;sound&lt;/em&gt; more scientific, but it is no better than them saying "I'm feeling better."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="tq"&gt;Justin - "How often does it work, as it were, that people go down to a two or a zero?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="tq"&gt;Robby - "It's a hard question, but I would say more than half of the times...I'd say probably around 65% of the time.  If people let you keep praying for them, it will go down.  But some people get freaked out by the fact that something is happening, and they will be 'all right, stop.'"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;Here's another interesting case.  He's making a bold claim that it is working 65% of the time, but it's hard to tell, which lets him write off the failures.  But these seem like much better odds than science-based medicine, if it is correct.  He's also saying that people want him to stop, because they experience the change.  That let's him write off anyone who stops early, while still maintaining that it is working, so in his mind it remains evidence that it is working.  Again, maybe there are other explanations.  Perhaps they are freaking out because there is a crowd that is expecting something, and &lt;strong&gt;nothing&lt;/strong&gt; is happening, which would totally be uncomfortable for someone.  Again, they are setting up a situation where people have a vested interest to lie, not out of a malicious intent, but to  simply cover themselves from an embarrassing situation, for themselves, the congregation or the minister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="aq"&gt;David - "If someone is feeling better then that is great..."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;Ok, I'm going to interrupt, and comment on that little amount.  Yes, it is good if they are feeling better - no one wants another to be in pain.  But I think it does matter how they are feeling better.  If a doctor gave a sugar pill, said that it would help the pain, the patient gets the transient pain relief from placebo effect - I don't think that's a good thing.  When the pain comes back, they haven't dealt with the symptoms, and they are likely to return to the same bogus treatment.  I think back on a friend of mine who pursued dubious so-called alternative medical treatments, while her (unknown to her at the time) cancer progressed.  She kept going back to these treatments, like acupuncture and homeopathy, when the placebo pain relief ended.  In the end the cancer was too advanced by the time it was diagnosed, so it really does matter not just &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; you feel better, but &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt;.  It's not always a good thing that someone is feeling better, if by feeling better makes them worse in the long run. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="aq"&gt;David - "it doesn't seem to be something that could be explained by a much simpler set of assumptions.  for example, they are in a suggestive, persuasive environment, on stage.  If they already believe that it could happen anyway, then the strong personality speaking to them, even with the caveats of 'are you just being nice to me', there still would be some psychological pressure to conform, even if subconscious."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;Bingo!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="tq"&gt;Justin - "You'd probably prefer the simpler explanation, it's probably adrenaline, probably psychological pressure,..."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="aq"&gt;David - "Not probably, but it &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be these things, and we know that these things happen routinely. "&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;That was a nice catch.  We have a whole host of &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; explanations, all of which are more likely than a miracle healing, and any one of them (or multiple ones) would work but the person claiming the miracle would have to rule those out at least to justify this more complex more fantastical explanation of "miracle".  The skeptic need to pin any of these alternatives on the particular case.  The skeptic is not making the knowledge claim that they are confident in a &lt;em&gt;particular&lt;/em&gt; explanation, they are just not convinced of the more complex and fantastical explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="tq"&gt;Robby - "I had three young men who were atheists, and said "You're full of it."  I appreciate your honesty.  I grabbed the microphone as we were finishing this healing session and I asked if anyone had leg shortening.  Since we had war survivors there, we had about 8 people come forward who had a leg shorter than another.  And I had those guys, and said to just say the words, and they said that they didn't believe in it.  I just told them to repeat the words after me, and we held the legs...and the all the legs were clear."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="atheist"&gt;David - Why is God limited to &lt;em&gt;incremental&lt;/em&gt; leg extensions, as opposed to a full amputee? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;It would be so simple to document a healed amputee to the satisfaction of a skeptic.  If this works 50% of the time they should be able to go to a convention of war veterans, or the paralympics, or something like that and heal 50% of the cases.  I'd be satisfied with 10%...actually, I'd be satisfied with 1%, but the number is in fact &lt;strong&gt;zero&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;It makes you wonder why, when there is actual evidence to look at, it is &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; only the things that are either&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li class="me"&gt;subjective&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="me"&gt;easily manipulated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="me"&gt;small scale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;and never the big stuff, never the things that are easy to show actually happened.  You don't even need to show that the prayer itself did it, just one case of an amputee regrowing a limb would at least show there is some effect there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="tq"&gt;Justin - "Is David asking for too high a level of evidence here?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="tq"&gt;Robby - "No, I don't.  Here's the bottom line.  Bottom line is it requires &lt;em&gt;faith&lt;/em&gt;...and faith is risk.  And faith is a hard thing to risk."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;I think he may go on to define his use of the word "faith", but I think he's using it in the way that I use it, and that is "believing things without appropriate evidence". Yes, that is risky!  It's a dumb risk, you shouldn't do it.  It's a needless risk.  He's playing the "Oh, you're asking for too much evidence, and I expect you to believe this without the evidence" card.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="tq"&gt;Robby - "I did this all over Princeton University, an epicenter for atheists and skeptics, and many people were sitting there watching legs grow out and going 'Whoa'.  They would say 'if I could see this happen, then I'd believe it' and then they sat there and watched it happen and responded 'no, no, no, this must have been happening, or that must have been happening'.  There's always going to be another explanation."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;That is the moment that I have seen in so many of these.  It's really the cry-baby response - "Boo hoo!  You're asking for too much evidence!  You're not convinced by my flimsy attempts at demonstrating this!"  This sort of response just would not fly in any scientific arena, and that attitude just annoys me after a while.  You have something to claim that you think is true...great.  You should be able to demonstrate it to skeptics.  They will come up with alternative explanations...great...that's their job, and the absolute right response to you making an extraordinary claim.  That's what they are supposed to do, and if you can't demonstrate that it is not one of their alternative explanations, then &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; haven't done &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; job.  That's the job that every scientist has to do, and sometimes it takes years, and sometimes it takes being more clever at designing the experiment and the proper controls, but you have to do that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;You propose that the universe is &lt;em&gt;accelerating&lt;/em&gt;, which wasn't on anyones radar, and people don't believe it, what do you do?  You improve the data, you lower the uncertainties, you demonstrate how it fits in the understood cosmology.  You address, and rule out, the alternative explanations and the possible biases.  You say that anyone can inspect your methods, reproduce it themselves.  If it is true, then the skeptics come around.  The alternative explanations are not bad.  The skepticism is not bad, it is the correct process of getting to the truth.  Things that collapse under that pressure are probably not true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;That's what it means to demonstrate something.  It doesn't mean showing it once, under uncontrolled circumstances, from a distance, where the skeptics can't reproduce it.  That's not demonstrating it, that's a &lt;em&gt;trick&lt;/em&gt;.  And people have seen magic tricks, and so they'll acknowledge that you've done a trick, even if they don't know exactly how it was done.  They'll think 'if I try to do it, it won't work', or 'under this other set of circumstances, it won't work', etc... Like the spoon bending of Uri Geller.  The problem is not just that these people are mistaken, but that they don't seem to recognize that the skeptical response is the &lt;em&gt;proper&lt;/em&gt; one, and that if they actually had something to demonstrate that they should have no problem convincing the skeptics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;If you claim to have an effect that worked 50% of the time that cured various diseases, especially physical structural ones, you should be able to an MRI or some other scan, do the prayer, then do the scan afterward and see a measurable effect.  In addition, you should enthusiastically do that..."Game on!  I think something here, so let's show it in the most quantifiable, reproducible way possible, in front of the skeptics!"  That's what the &lt;a href="http://web.bryant.edu/~bblais"&gt;attitude should be&lt;/a&gt;...if you think something is true.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;That's what science is - it's an attitude.  It's that attitude that you test everything, that you don't believe anything until demonstrated, and you find ways to measure things to the point where even the skeptics are convinced.  And that is the stuff we know is true, and everything else is questionable.  These faith healers don't demonstrate the attitude, or ability, or the willingness to put their money where their mouth is.  They have a ton of anecdotes, a bunch of things in uncontrolled circumstances that they claim are significant but just are not, and that is the problem.  Then they chide the skeptics for being skeptics, for not being convinced by these parlor tricks.  I'm sorry, but that won't convince me.  Too bad...grow up...and don't cry about people demanding a lot of evidence.  That's just the wrong &lt;strong&gt;wrong&lt;/strong&gt; attitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="tq"&gt;Robby - "It could be a stadium, let's say Wimbledon is filled and somebody sees someone raised from the dead.  There's going to be, say, 'it's mass hypnosis', there's always going to be something.  It always comes down to this place of saying 'I'm &lt;em&gt;choosing&lt;/em&gt; to have faith', 'I'm &lt;em&gt;choosing&lt;/em&gt; to believe' "&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;This is &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; what I said he would say about faith - he is &lt;em&gt;choosing&lt;/em&gt; to believe, even though the evidence doesn't support it.  You have 100,000 people see someone raised from the dead, yet have no actual data on it?  Yes, that's likely to be mass hypnosis, or hysteria, or whatever.  Fatima, is a good example of that, which &lt;a href="http://web.bryant.edu/~bblais/a-little-about-miracles.html"&gt;I cover elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;.  But if you had 100000 independent iphone videos, along with skeptical doctors following proper procedures, and they all say that this guy was dead for week and came back, then yes I would be convinced.  But there is never &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; data on that scale - it's always this flimsy, anecdotal, incremental, subjective crap that we get again and again that convinces the believer who &lt;em&gt;chooses&lt;/em&gt; to believe, but doesn't convince anyone else.  The same thing happens with alien abductions...the &lt;em&gt;exact&lt;/em&gt; same thing happens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="aq"&gt;David - "It would take extraordinary evidence, if you are going to make an extraordinary claim about something that doesn't happen routinely.  The sort of evidence that would convince me that it happened would have to be similar.  My question is, why do we get all sorts of stories of minute incremental centimeter changes in leg lengths, but nothing where it is entire regeneration?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="atheist"&gt;David - He demonstrates that a simple hip motion can give the illusion of leg lengthening, without it actually happening, and adds that the person need not be doing it consciously, that they are responding the psychological pressure of the session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;So here is &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; plausible explanation for the leg adjustment (there are probably many others), so the question I'd ask the Robby is - have there been any steps done to eliminate that as a possible explanation?  For example, an actual amputation can't be "recovered" in this way.  Some objective measure of length used, perhaps from a body scan, and measured off the image from a consistent point (edge of hip to bottom of heel, for example).  You cannot play the card "these people are honest, they don't have any reason to lie" [even though they do!], that's just not the point.  If it could possibly be explained by hip adjustment, how would you design the test to eliminate that as a possibility - this is what a scientist does and not at all what these people do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="theist"&gt;Justin - "Is it still relevant that it happened when she was prayed for in a healing session, that it happened &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt;?  Can you at least acknowledge that it is an interesting correlation?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="aq"&gt;David - "Absolutely not.  What would it take to convince you that it is not real?  Because, to make any sense at all, you have to count the misses not just the hits, because if you are only counting the hits and ignoring the misses, your confirmation bias insulates you from any refutation of what you believe.  You have to look into how many times people have been prayed for and nothing happens at all."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="theist"&gt;Justin - "And you're [Robby] perfectly open to saying that happens sometimes..."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="theist"&gt;Robby - "Oh, yes. It happens all the time."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;That's correct - it happens &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; the time. You can't even count how many prayers people do, and they don't appear to work nearly all the time. Occasionally they appear to work - but this doesn't establish a correlation.  This reminds me of the so-called tie between eclipses and earthquakes that is sometimes claimed.  Unfortunately, eclipses happen so often that you're &lt;em&gt;guaranteed&lt;/em&gt; to have an eclipse before an earthquake.  If you pray all the time, the random medical improvements that people have will be &lt;em&gt;guaranteed&lt;/em&gt; to be after a prayer.  If you only report the events where you prayed and there was an improvement, then you'll seriously bias your conclusions.  This is why one needs to do  controlled prayer studies, to include &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the cases - both successes and failures.  When you do this for prayer, some studies there's an improvement, in others things get worse, in all of them the effect is barely measurable.  This is exactly the sort of result you get from treatments that ultimately are shown not to have any real effect.  Nothing ever comes close to these wild claims by Robby Dawkins that the healing effects happen "more than half the time" and that, by itself, is a refutation of what he's talking about.  Now he could say, "Look, you have to do it in a Church setting, do it under the auspices of a minister, and perhaps a particular kind of minister, etc..."  One might be able to design a controlled experiment around this stipulations, as long as those stipulations are specific enough.  If the stipulation is something like "it doesn't work when skeptics are around", that doesn't count.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="theist"&gt;When asked why his own thyroid disease, despite prayers, has not been cured Robby's answer is - the devil does it! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="tq"&gt;Robby - "There's a spiritual opposition and there is a power of the enemy that is contending against that."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="aq"&gt;David - "That is introducing yet another untestable unknown to the equation, which is ballooning with unknowns.  That doesn't get us anywhere toward what is objectively happening."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="tq"&gt;Justin - "What I'm seeing here myself is two completely different worldviews coming together...you don't believe, David, that there is a spiritual realm...full stop.  Robby is convinced there is, and so for Robby this is the explanation."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;I've heard this "blame the worldviews" thing before, but I think that's bogus.  The reason it is bogus is that, if there really is an agent opposing you, you should be able to tell that it is really an agent and that it is really opposing you, not just "sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, it must be an agent".  That's not enough.  It cannot be simply be that we can explain this with an agent, you have to be able to demonstrate that it is &lt;em&gt;likely&lt;/em&gt; to be an agent because of X, Y, and Z.  You can interpret the seasons, for example, as driven by agents (as the pagans do), but that doesn't make it so.  It can't be post-hoc: if it doesn't work, it's the agent working against me, if it does work, it is another agent working for me.  That doesn't wash, and it is not a matter of &lt;em&gt;worldviews&lt;/em&gt;.  The reason why I don't think there is a spiritual realm is that no one has posited &lt;em&gt;evidence&lt;/em&gt; for the spiritual realm that is even remotely consistent or has any real content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="tq"&gt;Robby - "I think what I see in every dialog with atheists like this, the kind of communication is, don't tell me about the headache being better, I want to know a whole limb growing out...but what about the person who is feeling better with the headache?  Are we just throwing them out, that they don't matter? .... There is a video of a guy's toe, his big toe is missing, and after prayer it appears.  There is a video, but I don't have it in my possession.  Of course, anyone could say, that the film was doctored.  It all comes down to an issue of faith. " &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="aq"&gt;David - "I would need multiple, independent video of the same event.  The hard thing for your position is that, with the proliferation of technology, almost everyone in the western world has a high quality 1080p camcorder in their pocket.  If these things routinely happen, as much as is professed with testimony, there is no way that it wouldn't be captured by somebody somewhere, multiple people somewhere."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;This is the same thing with UFO claims - the number of visitations and observances of UFOs has gone &lt;em&gt;down&lt;/em&gt; with the proliferation of the technology to record it, rather than the significant &lt;em&gt;increase&lt;/em&gt; of recorded UFO events one would expect to happen if these things were real.  This is strong evidence against the veracity of the claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;Notice what he's doing here.  He's asking why we want to ignore the small effect (e.g. headache).  I'd say, that he's making huge claims, so we'd need a comparable effect.  If the headache goes away on its own without prayer much of the time, then you haven't demonstrated that the prayer actually made the headache go away, and that is the entire point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;He still has this "cry-baby" response, that we'll be skeptical of the video.  This is one of the reasons that science is hard - you do have to do the leg-work to design the experiment so that it is reproducible and eliminates the alternatives.  That is a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; thing.  One could interpret the prayer as witchcraft, and that the nature spirits are coming in to heal the headache.  Would you be convinced by that?  Would Robby be convinced?  How would he respond if the person said "you just have to have faith"?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="tq"&gt;Robby - (about the facts surrounding the lung regeneration story earlier) "The original facts that I got from the medical report, it was on an old scroll fax without the best of ink, and since then it's faded.  Somebody did contact the doctor to see if they had a newer hard copy of the report since, but the doctor has since passed away, so it's been hard to get a hold of that information."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="aq"&gt;David - "It's a common theme, isn't it?  Craig Marsh is it, with the stomach, and the eye in Peru...where there is a really tremendous example, there is always something like 'we've go the evidence but it's just not here, someone won't publish it', it's always supposedly there but never actually there."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;That is &lt;em&gt;totally&lt;/em&gt; the common theme.  They said that they tried to publish it in the medical journal, and the journal said it was 'too weird' and wouldn't publish it.  That is ridiculous.  If it is really weird, and true, then they'd love to see it!  The only reason they wouldn't publish it is if was terribly written or there was no evidence of it.  Also, this sounds suspiciously like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Smith"&gt;Joseph Smith&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates"&gt;Golden Plates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="tq"&gt;Justin - "Those kind of verified medical records released, are hard to come by, and for miracles that occur in the developing world there are no such services to verify all of these."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;No, that's not quite correct.  It is &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the time, it's &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;single&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; case.  There is not a &lt;em&gt;single&lt;/em&gt; case where there has been good documentary evidence of a significant miracle...not a &lt;em&gt;single&lt;/em&gt; case in all of the anecdotes.  If you contrast that with 50-60% of the healings work, that is devastating and is an indication of something that just doesn't work. How else could you explain that there is not a &lt;em&gt;single&lt;/em&gt; case of &lt;em&gt;well-documented&lt;/em&gt; miracle? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="tq"&gt;Justin - "There is some nervousness with some physicians that this could look like 'I misdiagnosed the illness', so I am not going to be easily releasing the medical records because this might come back to bite me."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="tq"&gt;Robby - "I've talk to doctors where this is the case."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;This is the first legitimate issue raised, I believe, but it still falls under the umbrella of "it's hard to get data sometimes".  Boo hoo, cry-baby again.  Does Robby think that it is a walk in the park to get the supernova data and make sure things are calibrated properly to establish the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerating_universe"&gt;accelerating universe&lt;/a&gt;, or to find the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson"&gt;Higgs Boson&lt;/a&gt;?  Does he think that was really easy to do?  One doesn't have to get medical records from the doctors, one can get them from the patients and the families who can release whatever they want without feeling nervous.  If I can come up with, in one minute, an easy work-around for this problem, then Robby clearly is not putting much effort to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="tq"&gt;Robby - (about a woman who had cancer supposedly healed, describing what the doctor would put in the report) "The doctor said 'you prayed for her, and that is the only explanation I have'.  I asked him, 'what will go in your report?', and he goes that 'she is cancer free, that it is gone.  I'd put down that it was there, and that we are not seeing any traces of it.'  I asked him if he'd put down that she received prayer, and he said 'No, I wasn't in the room, and that would not be part of the treatment anyway so I would not document that'.  And so that is very typical, and I understand that."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;He's taking the successes again and ignoring the misses.  He's very quick to say that this is the &lt;em&gt;result&lt;/em&gt; of the prayer, and not some other random thing, but when it doesn't appear to work 99.999% of the time when nothing happens, he responds with "the devil" or "God's plan" or individual unwillingness to accept the miracle.  It always works when it works, and there is an excuse when it doesn't.  This is not how we do science, and it is totally obvious selection bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="aq"&gt;David - "We do know that strange and unexplainable things happen, the body is a complex, messy system, and it really is the case the cancer does spontaneously remiss.  That does happen with and without prayer.  If someone prays for it, and it happens, you could try to say that the prayer worked but it doesn't mean anything unless you count the times that it doesn't work.  So what I'd like to really ask, is there anything that would make you not believe it works?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;This last question will just flew over Robby's head, because I don't think he understands the attitude of constructing falsifiable claims.  For someone who is not a skeptic, I don't think he understand what it even means to craft claims in this way.  I think a better way to put that is, once you recognize that cancer going away happens with or without prayer &lt;em&gt;sometimes&lt;/em&gt;, if you know that pain goes way with or without prayer &lt;em&gt;sometimes&lt;/em&gt; (all it takes is &lt;em&gt;sometimes&lt;/em&gt;) - and you can insert for 'prayer' here 'new medical treatment X' - how do you figure out some way to distinguish between X &lt;em&gt;causing&lt;/em&gt; the cancer to go away and the cancer going away for totally unknown and unrelated reasons.  How do you do that, when you don't know and can't control those unrelated effects?  What you do is to create a study, with a control group, blinded, etc... and you look at how often cancer goes away with and without X., counting all the successes and failures.  What is found when you do that carefully is that prayer has no effect, or such a tiny effect to be totally meaningless.  This is how you do it.  If you can't distinguish between doing X and nothing, then that is equivalent to nothing.  This is totally at odds with the grand claims Robby is making.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="tq"&gt;Robby - "You believe that things can happen out of nothing...and that is a really high level of faith."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;This is adding insult to injury.  This is just false.  We don't understand why things like cancer sometimes disappear, but that doesn't mean that we believe there is no cause.  There is certainly &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; reason for it, but we just don't have access to it (at the moment).  We don't know the conditions specific enough for the reason something worked in this case, and not another.  We just don't know.  If you're making the further claim that you can improve the situation with prayer, the only way to justify this claim is by isolating the variables, and doing a proper study.  It has &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; to do with faith, it is simply saying that some things happen that we don't understand, not the positive claim that there is no cause.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;A few final thoughts on the episode.  I did try to confirm the story of the man regrowing the lung or heart.  I couldn't find &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; reference to it at all, except for the claims in Robby Dawkins' book, from which it appears that he was essentially reciting in the episode.  He has this story, with no details at all, not even a city, a year, a hospital,...nothing, just nothing to go on.  It could be that I didn't look long enough, but it makes me wonder if this guy simply made up the story because it sounds great and is a total dead-end for anyone trying to confirm it.  I'd love to see the data!&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;Now, how should Robby respond to this insinuation that he may be lying?  He should be mad, I believe.  Great!  Robby, show me that I'm wrong.  Present to me the evidence that you have for this bold claim, and I will take this back.  I'd love to know that I'm wrong.  Bring out the documentation.  As of now, I can't tell the difference between a total fabrication, Robby simply being mistaken, or this even actually happened.   If I can't tell that difference, I go with what is most likely, and a story like this totally benefits Robby, so he has a definite vested interest in making it up or uncritically accepting a rumor that he heard and proliferating it.  Show me that I'm wrong...I'd love it.  This is difference between scientists and many others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;Let's end with an analogy.  Let's say I claim that voodoo dolls actually work.  Just the other day, I was mad at someone, I made a doll of them, poked a pin in their head, and they got a headache.  I've done this many times - I've given people back aches, knee pain, etc...  I've even caused someone serious harm, say, with a pin through the heart.  No, I'm sorry I don't have any documentation for it or, I did have documentation for it but it's gone now, or the doctor verified that there was a large hole through this person's heart and they have the documentation but won't release it, etc...  But you can examine all these cases where someone got a headache, or back aches, because of my voodoo dolls.  No, it doesn't happen all of the time, but it happens most of the time.  And when it doesn't happen, there are positive spirits that keep that from happening - but the voodoo dolls really work more the 65% of the time.  How is this &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; different from Robby's claims?  I doubt Robby would believe this, but the question is why?  What process did he use to come to the negative conclusion that he couldn't have used on his own claims?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Unbelievable Project"></category><category term="unbelievable"></category></entry><entry><title>Noah and the Flood - did it happen? - 16 February 2008</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Mar/19/noah-and-the-flood-did-it-happen-16-february-2008/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-03-19T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2014-03-19T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2014-03-19:/posts/2014/Mar/19/noah-and-the-flood-did-it-happen-16-february-2008/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As part of the &lt;a href="http://web.bryant.edu/~bblais/unbelievable-project-a-non-believers-armchair-perspective-on-six-years-of-christian-debates.html"&gt;Unbelievable Project&lt;/a&gt;, I am taking notes and "arm-chair" responding to each of the &lt;a href="http://www.premierradio.org.uk/shows/saturday/unbelievable.aspx"&gt;Unbelievable podcast&lt;/a&gt; episodes

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="notes"&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noah's flood episode - this one is going to be painful. (said before listening to it) :-) {.me}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David - After exploring the concepts, he has determined that things don't go from dinosaurs to birds, and so on, &lt;em class="tq"&gt;"there is too much complexity for it to have happened by chance."&lt;/em&gt;}  {.theist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one sentence alone, which was what he started out saying, demonstrates without any doubt that he has &lt;em&gt;zero&lt;/em&gt; understanding of science, especially the process of evolution.  &lt;em&gt;By chance&lt;/em&gt;?  Not a &lt;em&gt;single&lt;/em&gt; biologist on the planet makes the claim that this complexity arose by chance - a statement easily verified from any introductory biology textbook.  With such a start, do I really need to listen to the rest of the argument?  When someone demonstrates such a profound ignorance of the subject, can I trust that he has correctly assessed the evidence? If his sole motivation for seeking an alternative explanation is based on not understanding the original explanation, is there value in considering his point of view at all?  I am not sure.  {.me}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David - The laying down of chalk deposits all around Europe is evidence of a large catastrophe. {.theist}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert - Ice cores don't show evidence of a global flood, we have bristlecone pine trees that are over 5000 years old and others that are 10000 years old.  Creationists like to be selective, and say that trees can lay down more than one ring in a year to try to cast doubt on the tree ring data.  However, a bigger problem is that sometimes they don't lay down any rings in the year.  Science is well aware of these problems, which is why they cross-reference to other methods, such as carbon dating, other tree rings, ice cores, the timing of known events such as volcanos, etc...  {.atheist}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gregg - asked why there aren't fossils of people and fish and animals all mixed into all of the layers?  To point out a few things that are laid down quickly, like volcanic (igneous) rock, doesn't  support the general pattern.  {.atheist}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are very good points.  My favorite challenging question to creationists is &lt;em&gt;"how did the koala bear reach Australia after the flood?"&lt;/em&gt;  There isn't a &lt;em&gt;single&lt;/em&gt; fossil of a koala from Mount Ararat to Australia.  {.me}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David - nothing could fossilize in the fractions of an inch per year necessary for building up these large calcium carbonate deposits. {.theist}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gregg - The creationists often have bizarre explanations for why the lower levels of the strata have simpler organisms and the upper levels have more complex organisms.  The explanations are often like differential mobility yields order, i.e. "the bigger dinosaurs would die and sink, birds are faster and fly, and that's why we get the order we have".    {.atheist}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to ask it is, why is there not a &lt;em&gt;single&lt;/em&gt; rabbit fossil in the pre-cambrian layers...one small, sick and slow rabbit which couldn't keep up with the others, etc...? There isn't even &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; dinosaur in the layer with humans?  This is a reminder that one can come up with &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; scenarios for anything, but at some point they require so many extra assumptions, or things to be &lt;em&gt;just right&lt;/em&gt; that they strain credulity.  {.me}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert - Why is it that children are not found lower in the geological layering than the adults of the same species? {.atheist}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David - When clams die they open up, and yet all the clam fossils are closed.  This speaks to a catastrophic event.{.theist}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here again, there are no answers given to the obvious questions, and select examples (i.e. clams) are trotted out as if they demonstrate the entire pattern.  The cherry-picking here is amazing! {.me}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David - Darwin observed beak changes, not origin of species.{.theist}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going from Darwin's observations of small changes in an observable small time scale to speciation on the unobservable large time scale is a matter of inference, and does not require direct observation of speciation on the large scale to support it.  Of course there are &lt;a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-speciation.html"&gt;many observations of speciation&lt;/a&gt;, but that is not the point here.  Creationists love to make a distinction between so-called micro-evolution (small change) and macro-evolution (large change), and then claim that all that is observed is micro-evolution.  From this line of argument, you could never talk about nearly any process in astronomy, because they almost all take place over scales too long to observe.  In astronomy, as in the field of evolution, one often sees snapshots of the process at many different times along the process, and have to infer the process.  Once you infer the process, there are ways of testing it by directing your observations to certain things, like the detailed structure of galaxies or the detailed relationships in DNA codes.  This is a basic property of all science, really, and I have disdain for the creationist diversions.  {.me}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David -   Also the Bible says &lt;em&gt;kinds&lt;/em&gt;, not species. Noah could have brought on one kind of wolf, not all kinds of dogs, for example. When it was pointed out that there would have had to have been a lot speciation in 4000 years or so, he countered that a lot can be done with breeding in that length of time.  {.theist}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, he fails to address the issue here, because I'm fairly certain people have not been breeding beetles this entire time, and the number of species of beetles would have overwhelmed the ark. {.me}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert brings up diversity, as measured by allele frequency, but I get the feeling that there are clearly, more direct arguments than the ones he is choosing to bring up.  For example, the creationist would have to estimate speciation rates millions of times higher than is observed to get the diversity observed, and yet they still claim that speciation can't occur because of the slow process of evolution - you can't have it both ways! {.me}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full Title: &lt;em&gt;Unbelievable? 22 Dec 2007 - Did Christians steal Christmas? - 22 December 2007 -- Did Christians steal Christmas?&lt;/em&gt;
    &amp;gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justin is joined by atheist Robert Stovold who claims that Christians stole Christmas! He says the Gospel stories are nothing more that a re-hashing of similar pagan legends. Doug Harris of the Reachout Trust says that's ridiculous and will be going head to head with Robert to defend the Christmas story. Guests Ken Humphreys and Anthony McRoy also join the fray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://media.premier.org.uk/unbelievable/252696d2-9f07-48a7-8931-4518e975583c.mp3"&gt;Download mp3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Justin Brierley - Christian Moderator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doug Harris - Christian&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Robert Stovold - Atheist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="notes"&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justin - In the Christmas story, it isn't stated how many wise men, and they don't go to the stable.  So is this Christmas story cobbled together from other pagan stories, other myths? Are Matthew and Luke simply drawing on these other religions?  {.theist}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert - They may not have been taking from them directly, but using the &lt;em class="aq"&gt;"currency of the time"&lt;/em&gt;} to tell their story, and these sorts of stories were around.  Robert doesn't know if they were presented as fact (as Christians often claim today).  We don't know what the earliest Christians believed.  Keep in mind that the earliest Gospel (i.e. Mark) and the earliest Christian writings (i.e. Paul) don't mention the Nativity.{.atheist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doug - Some of these Pagan myths were written after the Gospels, some of them had many stories and weren't coherent.  &lt;em class="tq"&gt;"Where is the evidence that Matthew and Mark borrowed from them?"&lt;/em&gt; }  Luke actually claims to be using eye witnesses.  Why would he suddenly bring in myth and legend?  {.theist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very quick answer to the last one is that Luke &lt;em&gt;claims&lt;/em&gt; to be bringing in using eye witnesses, which could easily be to make his account seem more credible.  It certainly works for Christian apologists!{.me}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doug - Either it all came from legend or none of it came from legend.  The virgin birth is not an isolated, incoherent event in the story.  It is tied to his life work, to the Resurrection, etc...  There is no legend that has all of these components. {.theist}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's a very silly argument, because even Paul doesn't include any of these components - he doesn't mention the virgin birth, or kings, or censuses.  He doesn't mention Resurrection &lt;em&gt;stories&lt;/em&gt;, only &lt;em&gt;appearances&lt;/em&gt;.  The Iliad and Odyssey both include real places, even if much of the story is legend and myth.  {.me}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert - &lt;em class="aq"&gt;"How do you establish the virgin birth from eyewitnesses?"&lt;/em&gt;}  You can't!  Luke didn't have to be making things  up, he could simply be writing what other people told him, which he believed. {.atheist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert - Most people don't think that Adam and Eve really existed, because then you run into problems with archaeology, cosmology, etc... yet Luke has a genealogy of Jesus that goes back to Adam.   You then have to take the Adam and Eve story seriously if you want to take the Luke story seriously.  {.atheist}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert - People should be under no illusions that what they are doing is simply &lt;em class="aq"&gt;"picking and mixing"&lt;/em&gt;} in the Bible. {.atheist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I entirely agree here, and I really like the idea of tying Luke's genealogy to the story of Adam, because it makes clear one of the (many) reasons we don't trust these sources.  As for "picking and mixing", it was Matt Dillahunty who said that 
"the Bible is a giant book of multiple choice".  You can read out of it any message that you want to, because it contains either contradictory statements, or statements that can be read either way.  You agree with slavery?  There are verses for that!  You are opposed to slavery?  There are verses for that!{.me}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doug - Comments on the so-called mistranslation of virgin by Matthew, pointing out that the Greek word for maiden already was being used in the context of virgin at Matthew's time, and thus is not a mistranslation as is typically claimed by atheists.{.theist}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe this is correct, also stated by &lt;a href="http://www.robertmprice.mindvendor.com/"&gt;Robert Price&lt;/a&gt;.  It is one of the cases of a traditional atheist argument that is unfounded when you look at the data.{.me}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doug - Where is the evidence that these stories either are legends or are borrowed from legends?  Just because they may be similar, does not mean that they are in fact legends or borrowed from those legends.{.theist}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert - The burden of proof lies with the one making the extraordinary claim (e.g. virgin birth, star of Bethlehem, etc...), like claims for unicorns.{.atheist} &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doug - If you didn't have the &lt;em class="tq"&gt;"naturalistic presupposition"&lt;/em&gt;} against miracles, you wouldn't be so skeptical.{.theist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This canard really gets my goat.  As Robert Price says, you don't have to believe miracles to be impossible to not believe that every miracle claim is true.  Miracles, by their nature, must be rare so one would need particularly good evidence for one, &lt;em&gt;even if you believe they are possible&lt;/em&gt;.  There are no contemporary accounts of any of the events related in the nativity story, from the star, to the slaughter of the innocents, to the three kings, to the particulars of the census.  Even if there was a miracle, this is not convincing evidence for it.{.me}&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Unbelievable Project"></category><category term="unbelievable"></category><category term="Christmas"></category></entry><entry><title>Unbelievable Project: Did Jesus Exist?

&lt;li&gt;Full Title: &lt;em&gt;Did Jesus Exist? Bart Ehrman Q&amp;amp;A - Unbelievable? - 18 August 2012 -- Did Jesus Exist? Bart Ehrman Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this one-on-one edition of the show, Justin Brierley speaks to New Testament Historian Bart Ehrman about his recent book "Did Jesus Exist?" which argues for the historical fact of Jesus of Nazareth.
Ehrman, whose books are more usually at odds with evangelicals, was this time attacked by atheist proponents of "mythicism" - the view that Jesus never existed.
He responds to the criticisms, including mythicists Bob Price and Richard Carrier and answers questions sent in by Unbelievable? listeners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="notes"&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This episode doesn't have a &lt;em class="theist"&gt;theist&lt;/em&gt;, just the moderator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bart - [around 13:50] Carrier's review of my work is &lt;em class="atheist"&gt;"vitriolic"&lt;/em&gt; and not carried out in a &lt;em class="aq"&gt;"scholarly mode"&lt;/em&gt;.  Saying things like &lt;em class="aq"&gt;"this book is crap is not scholarly discourse."&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;em class="aq"&gt;"People who are truly interested in the historical issues don't write like this."&lt;/em&gt;}{.atheist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would have to agree with Bart Ehrman in this case.  I truly wish that people who have good points to make don't undermine it with juvenile behavior. However, I don't agree that Bart makes a strong case for the existence of the historical Jesus.  Part of this is that I am not &lt;em&gt;strongly&lt;/em&gt; convinced by historical arguments.  I can see that a reasonable person could support a belief in a historical Jesus, but I can't see that a &lt;em&gt;strong&lt;/em&gt; case can be made.  The counter arguments, by Carrier and Price primarily, seem convincing to me to the point that I am really agnostic about the existence of a historical Jesus.  As Robert Price says, the historical Jesus if he existed is forever lost behind the stained-glass curtain of legend.{.me}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bart - So a typical sort of argument from Carrier makes in his review is the "Pilot" error, dealing with a very minor point which has nothing to do with the issue.  Richard Carrier didn't mount any &lt;em&gt;positive&lt;/em&gt; arguments that Jesus didn't exist, and only attacked Ehrman's  scholarship.{.atheist}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bart - [around 24:40] Bart has an appeal to authority, claiming that Bob Price's opinion is not shared by virtually all mainstream scholars.{.atheist}  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have found that people lean on the consensus too much, especially apologists and Bart Ehrman.  Bob Price has gone on the record as saying that he doesn't care about the consensus, and just treats each case as it comes. In Price's words, &lt;em&gt;"truth isn't decided by a nose count."&lt;/em&gt;  A small note about consistency - sometimes I refer to Robert Price, Bob Price, or Robert M Price.  I've heard each of these used, even in this single episode, so please forgive my inconsistent use. {.me}  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bart - [around 28:30] Bart introduces the "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criterion_of_embarrassment"&gt;criterion of embarrassment&lt;/a&gt;" for the crucifixion, citing Bob Price's response that there are popular novels from the second century and hero stories like Spartacus where their hero is crucified or tortured, but escapes.  Thus, according to Bob Price, this sort of story was not embarrassing, but part of the literature already.  Bart retorts that he &lt;em class="aq"&gt;"doesn't know what Bob is talking about, and further, Bob doesn't know what he is talking about either"&lt;/em&gt; in terms of novels.  We have 5 Greek novels from the ancient world, and there are no characters in any of them who are crucified and then escape. He adds that the problem isn't that a hero gets crucified but a &lt;em&gt;Messiah&lt;/em&gt; gets crucified. We don't have any record of any Jew prior to Christianity saying that the Messiah would get crucified. {.atheist}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, this isn't a problem.  We have the same sort of thing in UFO cults and even in the Jehovah's Witnesses - the group expects something (e.g. rapture or getting beamed up) on a particular day.  That day comes, nothing happens, and they rework the expectation. As for the Greek novels, I will have to check this.  I am not familiar with the extent of the literature of the time.  {.me}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bart - challenges Bob Price to give a reference to &lt;em&gt;any Jew&lt;/em&gt; mentioning &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osiris"&gt;Osiris&lt;/a&gt; within 200 years of Jesus.  He then highlights the differences, such as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osiris"&gt;Osiris&lt;/a&gt; staying dead, with the soul going to the underworld but the body not coming back to life.{.atheist}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my understanding of both Bob Price and Richard Carrier, the claim isn't that the Jews consciously borrowed from the Osiris myth, but that it was part of the gestalt, with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncretism"&gt;syncretism&lt;/a&gt; being a common process, and that one wouldn't expect a direct mention. Further, Bart is assuming that the pre-Gospel tradition (i.e. Paul) referred to a bodily resurrection - I'm not convinced this is the case.{.me}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bart - considering the idea that the entire &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus_on_Jesus#Testimonium_Flavianum"&gt;Testimonium Flavianum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus"&gt;Josephus&lt;/a&gt; is a forgery, he essentially says that if you take out the Christian bits, the rest of it reads like Josephus, has the style of Josephus, so it is likely to be Josephus.  Also, if Christians had made up a passage, it would have been much longer and flowery.{.atheist}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not convinced at all by this.  The passage right before the Testimonium and right after flow smoothly into each other, the passage does not appear in an otherwise complete table of contents, and there is no mention of the passage by Church fathers (such as Origen) who had every opportunity and desire to quote such a thing. Finally, perhaps the forger would know that if the language was too flowery it would be called out as a fraud.  To me, trying to guess the language that might be used if the situation were different is not a strong foundation upon which to build an argument. {.me}&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Unbelievable Project"></category><category term="Religion"></category><category term="Unbelievable Project"></category></entry><entry><title>Unbelievable Project: The Probability of the Resurrection</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Jul/11/unbelievable-project-the-probability-of-the-resurrection/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-07-11T00:02:00-04:00</published><updated>2013-07-11T00:02:00-04:00</updated><author><name>brianblais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2013-07-11:/posts/2013/Jul/11/unbelievable-project-the-probability-of-the-resurrection/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h3 id="theprobabilityoftheresurrection-calummillerchrishallquist-unbelievable-06july2013--istheresurrection97likleyasswinburneclaims"&gt;The Probability of the Resurrection - Calum Miller &amp;amp; Chris Hallquist - Unbelievable? - 06 July 2013 – Is the resurrection 97% likley as Swinburne claims?&lt;/h3&gt;

    Chris Hallquist - Unbelievable? - 06 July 2013 – Is the resurrection
    97% likley as Swinburne claims?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christian philosopher Richard Swinburne has used probability
theory to show that the likelihood of the resurrection of Christ
is 0.97.&lt;br&gt;
 Calum Miller is a Christian apologist and student of Swinburne.
He talks about why he believes that probability theory can be used
to show that the resurrection is highly likely to be true.&lt;br&gt;
 Chris Hallquist is an atheist blogger who argues that the
resurrection is not well supported by evidence or probability.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h4 id="notes"&gt;Notes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me - I was really looking forward to this episode. What was not to
like? Probability theory, ancient religions, evidence for
Christianity…bring it on! Unfortunately, it really wasn’t that
impressive.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calum - &lt;em&gt;“There’s what’s called the confirmation of resurrection, the
explanatory power. And this is basically the idea that there is a lot of
evidence which, if the resurrection happened would be expected but if
the resurrection didn’t happen, it would be very improbable. And if this
is true, if there really is that kind of evidence, then it follows from
probability theory that our confidence in the resurrection should be
greatly increased by this evidence. [Concerning the prior], more
extraordinary or extreme events are more improbable to begin with, and
so you would need more evidence to confirm them. So a lot of the debate
about the resurrection comes down to the prior probability, whether we
think it is actually really improbable and that no possible evidence
could ever make us convinced of it. ”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me - He basically has the distinction between the following as the
basis for all of the “calculation”:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;evidence that, if it existed, would be very common if the
    resurrection &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; happen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;evidence that, if it existed, would be very rare if the
    resurrection &lt;em&gt;didn’t&lt;/em&gt; happen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the prior probability for the resurrection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;where he admits that &lt;em&gt;"the debate about the resurrection comes down to
the prior probability&lt;/em&gt;". Anyone doing probabilistic inference knows that
it should never come down primarily to your choice of priors. The data
needs to rise above the prior, and the prior needs to be an honest
-ideally objective- assessment of the pre-data probability assignments
or, often, the initial state of ignorance. By admitting this, Calum is
essentially saying either that:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the data are not strong enough to constrain a diffuse prior, and
    thus is unconvincing or…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;you have to come into the debate with a &lt;em&gt;sharp&lt;/em&gt; prior which admits
    to a presupposition of the strength of the claim.&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neither of these stances is convincing in the slightest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Further, in response to this set up, he ignores the most important
thing in any Bayesian treatment is the set of models that you are using
to compare. You cannot simply test the truth of a single model in
isolation, nor is it generally informative to compare model A true or
false. Instead one wants to set up a list of models, hypotheses,
theories to explain the data and evaluate those multiple models. Instead
of,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;you’d want&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
P({\rm resurrection}|{\rm data}), P({\rm hallucination}|{\rm
data}), P({\rm legend}|{\rm data}), P({\rm literary}|{\rm data}),
P({\rm hoax}|{\rm data}),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$ etc…&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;where of course each of these models would have many details beyond
the simple label I’m putting in here. By being explicit with what you’re
comparing to, it is easier to see where the different prior
probabilities come in. Are you really going to suggest that someone
rising from the dead is on par, prior to the data, with a legendary
construction given how many legendary constructions we’ve seen and how
many dead rising we’ve &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; seen?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is clear is that all of these other models must, a priori, be
more probable than rising from the dead &lt;em&gt;even if a God exists&lt;/em&gt;. Just
because you believe miracles &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; happen does not mean that you
believe every miracle claim is true, and given the number of clearly
false miracle claims, the prior probability for any miracle claim must
be quite low - even if you believe miracles actually occur.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another point about the data which Calum never deals with is that it
should include things we &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; see, not just things we do. If we
expect something to occur with a claim, and we don’t see it, that is in
fact evidence against the claim.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris - Most Christians might discount the claim that the miracles
around African religions seem to disappear in the US and UK because of
lack of faith. Or perhaps the miracle stories around Mormonism. What
makes the miracles of Jesus different than these ones? Once you accept
the idea that resurrection claims can exist quite commonly in a group of
religiously charged people, it is no longer quite so hard to understand
the resurrection claims in the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calum - The reports of an empty tomb are exactly what you’d expect if
the resurrection actually happened, and would be unlikely in the case of
a non-resurrection event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me - Dealing with this is actually very simple. He is correct that &lt;em&gt;if
the resurrection occurred&lt;/em&gt;, then the report of an empty tomb would very
likely be given, and I would add that it would also be very likely to be
reported in the earliest accounts we have of the resurrection. Is this
what we see? No! The empty tomb is not mentioned in Paul, neither are
the physical visitations, both of which you’d expect to see if the
Resurrection actually occurred. Even the visitations are not mentioned
in Mark! So, from a probabilistic point of view, this is the exact
opposite of what we’d expect to see if the resurrection actually
occurred. In fact the descriptions of the resurrection get more
elaborate and more physical the later the text (Paul has visions, Mark
has no visitations but the empty tomb, Matthew and Luke have
visitations, John has the doubting Thomas story, etc…). This is exactly
what we’d expect for legendary development, or a story that has been
embellished over time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The other thing, is it really all that unlikely to have an empty tomb
story with no resurrection? Notice, I’m not saying to have an empty
tomb, but to have an empty tomb &lt;em&gt;story&lt;/em&gt;. There are several different
routes to get that. One is as a literary device. I believe Richard
Carrier supports this, as a reference to Daniel. Another is a deliberate
counter to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docetism"&gt;Docetism&lt;/a&gt;, to gain favor and win an argument.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calum - &lt;em&gt;“It is not necessarily helpful to have just some kind of
religious context, it must be the right kind of one. So, for example, I
can see very good reasons why God would want to vindicate Jesus’
teaching by resurrecting him because I think Jesus taught a lot of very
good things, I thought he was (obviously as a Christian) I think he was
a very sincere, a very good person. And I can think of a lot of good
reasons why God would choose Jesus to be a prophet and to become
incarnate in him. Whereas I don’t see comparably good reasons why God
would want to vindicate Mormon teaching. Obviously a lot of that is
because I don’t know a lot about Mormonism but there’s still the
asymmetry there.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris - The positive evidence for Mormonism is a lot better than for
Christianity. We have signed documents by the early followers and
founders attesting to the miracles. The best we can say about Paul’s
evidence is that he had a vision. We have a lot of negative evidence for
Mormonism, to be sure, but if we knew more about Christianity perhaps
things would be different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me - I would add that we have this &lt;em&gt;pro-Christian&lt;/em&gt; filter for all of
our documents, a filter called the Middle Ages, where documents
supporting Christianity had a much better probability of surviving (i.e.
copied) than ones critical of Christianity. The only reason we have the
Nag Hammadi texts is that the monks refused to burn them, as ordered by
the Christian orthodoxy at the time, and instead chose to store them in
a cave. Think about that campaign of whitewashing for hundreds of years!
Actually, the fact that we have so little actual documentary support for
Christianity coming from the first century, despite this huge bias, to
me argues against Christianity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris- How do you know Jesus was sincere or not? Seems like the same
could be said for Joseph Smith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="afterward-abitaboutpriors"&gt;Afterward - a bit about priors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(this section is all &lt;strong&gt;Me -&lt;/strong&gt;, so I won’t put it in bold.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t really think that when Calum is referring to priors that he
really means that in the same way as &lt;em&gt;before the data&lt;/em&gt;. It seems to me,
and I believe Swinburne’s analysis reflects this, that the prior for
&lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; calculation is really the posterior for a &lt;em&gt;previous&lt;/em&gt; calculation
regarding the existence and properties of God. This is perfectly
legitimate Bayesian procedure, but it makes the argument a different
one. Because of this, &lt;a href="http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/23553-the-resurrection-of-god-incarnate/"&gt;Swinburne’s calculation&lt;/a&gt; for the probability of
God needs to be addressed before we can even deal with the priors in
this resurrection argument. That will have to be another post entirely,
but at any rate Calum did not do it a service in this debate, having not
really gotten to the meat of it when he could have.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Unbelievable Project"></category><category term="Probability"></category><category term="Religion"></category><category term="Unbelievable Project"></category></entry><entry><title>Unbelievable Project: Miracles and healing - is it evidence for the truth of Christianity?</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Mar/18/unbelievable-project-miracles-and-healing-is-it-evidence-for-the-truth-of-christianity/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-03-18T19:29:00-04:00</published><updated>2013-03-18T19:29:00-04:00</updated><author><name>brianblais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2013-03-18:/posts/2013/Mar/18/unbelievable-project-miracles-and-healing-is-it-evidence-for-the-truth-of-christianity/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2 id="unbelievable-17-nov-2007-are-miracles-evidence-for-god-17-november-2007-miracles-and-healing-is-it-evidence-for-the-truth-of-christianity"&gt;Unbelievable? 17 Nov 2007 - Are miracles evidence for God? - 17 November 2007 -- Miracles and healing - is it evidence for the truth of Christianity?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agnostic sceptic Stephen Pilcher believes that Christian claims to
healing are tricks of the mind.  Can John Ryeland of the Christian
Healing Mission persuade him differently?  Also features personal
stories from people who claim to have been miraculously healed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;li&gt;John Ryeland - Christian&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Heather Riley - Christian&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stephen Pilcher - Agnostic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="notes"&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen - &lt;em&gt;"I'm a church-going, Bible-reading agnostic"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me - That's pretty funny, because it is very close to what I am. I am
a church-going, Bible-reading atheist. Although I have read the Bible at
least once cover-to-cover a few years ago, I have lost patience with
reading it now. There is so much repetitious and tedious material, both
Old and New Testament, that I find it hard to read for long without
thinking I have better things to do with my time.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen - There are a large number of &lt;em&gt;"miracles"&lt;/em&gt; that aren't miracles
at all, and non-Christians can have healings as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heather - Her story is at 24:40, in case you want to listen to the
original. Here is a quick summary. She pursued a psychology degree,
studied the paranormal. About 3 or 4 months ago, she went to a
chiropodist (aka podiatrist) who told her that one leg was longer than
another (by an inch). She then went, unplanned, to a religious
gathering. During the meeting the preacher gave her some very specific
information about he from several years ago, some comforting words, and
a moving message. And then he healed the asymmetric leg. She said she
felt like she was &lt;em&gt;"on show"&lt;/em&gt; and that &lt;em&gt;"God's really got to do
something"&lt;/em&gt;. She also said that she didn't feel any different, but a
friend of hers observing saw the leg lengthening. So then she went back
to the chiropodist. She determined he was Christian, told the entire
story, he repeated the measurement and then did some more &lt;em&gt;robust&lt;/em&gt;
measurements, and found no difference in leg length. And since then, her
shoes are no longer asymmetric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen - People have done studies of faith healings and always come up
short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me - When I first heard that story, a year or so ago when I first
listened to this episode, I recall being pretty impressed with the
healing. Since then, after much reading, and hearing this again I am
not. (It is interesting that I recall it being more impressive, and if I
never heard the story again, might have started to spread a more
impressive story if I told it again. This is a nice reminder of how
these stories, working with the limitations of memory, can grow in the
telling and quickly become unfactual).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Anyway, why am I not impressed? There are a number of little details
that she dropped in that I find curious. Consider two models (there are
probably more!):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is a God, and he decides to heal this leg, but not other
    ailments, and not her husbands problems. This is hard to reconcile
    even on the face of it, and later in the show she talks about this
    somewhat.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is no God, these things don't happen, and there are other
    mundane explanations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Turns out that leg-lengthening is a very common form of &lt;em&gt;"healing"&lt;/em&gt; in
these sorts of situations (see "The Faith Healers" by James Randi),
because it looks impressive and is a straightforward trick. That's why
it is important to have magicians as well as scientists investigate such
claims, because scientists are terrible at detecting dishonesty and
trickery. The fact that she had no idea that one leg was longer, until a
few days before, that she did not feel the healing, and only went on the
word of the friend because she was expecting something to happen, that
she was impressed with the &lt;em&gt;"prophecy"&lt;/em&gt; that the preacher said,
referring to things he would have no idea about. James Randi speaks
about this at length, and shows how preachers will use planted people,
microphones, and other techniques to appear to know things they wouldn't
already know. Even if they aren't being deceptive, they may hear in
conversations with the friends ahead of time about Heather's problems,
and then work it into the &lt;em&gt;"prophecy"&lt;/em&gt;. When she goes back to the
chiropodist she finds out he is a Christian, and &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; he redoes the
measurement she tells the story. Now, this chiropodist has a vested
interest in confirming the healing, because it will confirm his
worldview. This is why we have double-blind measurements, because we
&lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; people bias the measurement, the reporting, the memory of it
because of their worldview. In fact, she tells that the chiropodist had
to do more robust measurements to confirm the equal leg length. Perhaps
there was an error in the first measurement. Perhaps the first
measurement was overestimated. Perhaps it wasn't, and &lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt; reported it
rounding up (i.e. he says a bit more than 1/2 inch, she tells her
friends around an inch, and then remembers it as such, etc...). Perhaps
the equipment for the first test has a bias, which might have motivated
him to make the more robust measurements. There are many possibilities
that do not require dishonesty, deliberate deception, incompetence, and
are completely mundane.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So which model can explain each of these? It seems clear to me that
there are perfectly good mundane explanations for nearly every detail of
the story, that the story is inconsistent even with a &lt;em&gt;"real"&lt;/em&gt; healing,
and that model 2 is definitely better. What about her asymmetric shoes,
and the pain that occured and went away after a while after the
&lt;em&gt;"healing"&lt;/em&gt;? My shoes tend to get asymmetric over time (not with each
other, but each pushed off to the outside) and when I get new shoes, and
they are flat, I have a little pain walking and running that goes away
as I adjust. Notice that these events happened &lt;em&gt;3 or 4 months ago&lt;/em&gt;.
There is no way that her new shoes would have become asymmetric in that
time &lt;em&gt;anyway&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John - &lt;em&gt;"There is an awful lot of anecdotal evidence, and I don't want
to be skeptical of it simply because it is not documented. What
else....is she not telling the truth? Of course she's telling the
truth!"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me - All we need is a slightly overzealous preacher, a slightly sloppy
chiropodist, and a small amount of congitive bias. It really is that
simple, and it doesn't require us to disparage the character of &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt;
in the story.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John - &lt;em&gt;"How high should we set the bar to know that this is a proper
healing story?"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John - &lt;em&gt;"For some people they want to make it so hard to call it a
miracle that nothing could ever satisfy that. I want to take Heather's
story, listen to it, and ask 'How did it change her'? If it is a story,
told with integrety, seems to have a lasting effect, of course it would
be better if it were documented, but we don't have the ability to get
the documentation."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me - I listen to this talk about documentation, and about how it's
&lt;em&gt;"so hard&lt;/em&gt;", some people are &lt;em&gt;"so skeptical"&lt;/em&gt; and I have to think &lt;em&gt;"cry
baby, cry baby, cry baby"&lt;/em&gt;. I even hear the little whining voice in my
head.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;"People should be more believing of my miracle claims"&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;"You're
being too skeptical"&lt;/em&gt;, etc... Of course, when it comes to &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt;
people's miracle claims, they are just as skeptical! It's only the ones
that support their worldview that they consider for special treatment.
Sorry, that's not good enough. Even Heather points this out, saying that
she feels that people are more skeptical of religious claims than claims
of the paranormal (which she saw in her studies of the paranormal).
She's noting, in others, the same thing she is doing with her worldview.
I've posted specifically about &lt;a href="https://brianblais.wordpress.com/2012/09/25/naturalistic-bias-presupposing-naturalism/"&gt;this problem here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In science, say you are trying to publish a paper, and the editor or
reviewer returns it saying that they are not convinced of your
conclusions, you don't go &lt;em&gt;"Oh, you're being too hard on me, too
skeptical. Getting the documentation for this effect I am claiming
exists is just too hard."&lt;/em&gt; That is just ridiculous. You find a way to
document it, with careful measurements, and you convince the skeptics if
it is true, or not if it is false. Truth should convince even the
skeptics, especially if you're claiming a large effect.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Take the Higgs boson, as an example of an unseen entity for which we
only can get indirect inference of its existence. It was proposed &lt;em&gt;50
years ago&lt;/em&gt;, and although people may have thought it was likely to be
there, they didn't &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt; it was there until the proper measurements
were done. Measurements which took decades to set up, required hundreds
of people as a team, and has cost billions of dollars, just to get the
documentation for the existence of something which doesn't even seem to
violate physical law. Think about that next time you hear someone claim
that getting documentation for healing is hard, or that the effect seems
to disappear whenever you look into it carefully, and that is the reason
there isn't any evidence for it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If the claimed effects of so-called faith-healings are real, they

&lt;p&gt;Full Title: &lt;em&gt;Unbelievable? 10 Nov 2007 - A "proxy" atheist explains
    why he can't believe - 10 November 2007 -- Radio Host Nick Pandolfi
    on being a 'proxy atheist'&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick Pandolfi is a radio presenter and newspaper columnist.  He
says Religion has been the cause of war and conflict, and
Christians can't agree on what they believe.  Peter Williams of
the Damaris Trust speaks on behalf of faith in Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://media.premier.org.uk/unbelievable/53a398dd-4e35-4854-8f87-84ef92fc1535.mp3"&gt;Download mp3.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Justin Brierley - Christian Moderator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Peter Williams - Christian&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nick Pandolfi - Atheist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="notes"&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick - (from his article, quote read by Justin) &lt;em&gt;"Religion can be what
you want it to be. A pick-and-mix victorious sponge God, or a full blown
hate-making factory. These religious folk don't exactly get on, do they?
How does religion explain its catastrophic failing to get on with
itself? No wonder people like me feel let down."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me - I've heard it as &lt;em&gt;"The Big Book of Multiple Choice"&lt;/em&gt;. An analogy
would be with simple proverbs (not the Biblical ones, although it might
work there). For any proverb, you can almost always find an opposite.
Consider the following two pairs:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Haste makes waste", "A stitch in time saves nine"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Too many cooks spoil the broth", "Many hands make light work"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me - Each of these is correct, in some context, but we are are
responsible for following the correct edict in the correct context. We
do this naturally, and people who read the Bible do this too - they just
don't realize that it is they who are making the moral choices, not
simply following the moral edicts of the Bible.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick - I find some atheists as ranting as some religious folks, and I
don't want to join that band. Hitting themselves all the time, moaning
about &lt;em&gt;"Christmas being stolen"&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;"Christmas doesn't exist"&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;"I
don't believe in this"&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;"I don't believe in that"&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me - I'm with him there. Sometimes I think it goes a bit overboard.
However, when it comes to &lt;em&gt;public&lt;/em&gt; funds being spent on &lt;em&gt;religious&lt;/em&gt;
iconography, I have a problem. Things like the ten commandments in
judicial halls, or official school prayers in public schools.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick - There is a lot of anger there, with Dawkins and Hitchens, etc...
and that's just not where he is. He feels it is &lt;em&gt;unlikely&lt;/em&gt; for there to
be a God but that he doesn't know, that he can't know, but he also
doesn't want to go the other way to claim that there is a God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me - this, to me, is atheism pure and simple, and I think that he is
really missing the definitions. even Dawkins would never say he &lt;em&gt;knows&lt;/em&gt;
there is no God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick - I do believe that many people perhaps misrepresent faith or
perhaps misrepresent their God, but to me behave in a way that does not
seem particularly religious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter - The fact that people do a lot of evil highlights one of the
truths that religion claims about the world that people are sinful and
that they need some kind of help to deal with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick - Religious people should know better, shouldn't they?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter - One should distinguish between people who do bad things
&lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; the grain of what their theology teaches them vs people who do
bad things &lt;em&gt;along the line&lt;/em&gt; of the ideology they follow. What would
happen if people followed Jesus' word seriously? Killing people is
clearly against the grain of what Jesus had in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter - If you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; follow Jesus, turn the other cheek, love your
enemy then the evil things shouldn't happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick - that's a great &lt;em&gt;"Get out of jail free"&lt;/em&gt; card - if you follow the
rule book, then it won't happen. But it &lt;em&gt;happens&lt;/em&gt;, has happened for far
too long, and will continue to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me- On the &lt;em&gt;"Get out of jail free"&lt;/em&gt;, I am in full agreement. This is
the &lt;em&gt;"no true Christian"&lt;/em&gt; fallacy. If you claim to be a Christian, and
are good, then you're a &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; Christian. If you're not, you're not
really a Christian.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter - this is not particular to religion, people who are irreligious
have done it, etc...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick - But you're bigger than politics, you're &lt;em&gt;religion&lt;/em&gt;, you're
supposed to be better, you're supposed to be the shining light example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me - I think Nick might be using the word &lt;em&gt;"religious"&lt;/em&gt; in a way that
his host, and discussion partner, is not seeing. I think, if I can speak
for him, he means that religion claims the moral high ground. As such,
we should perhaps hold religious people to a higher standard. For
example, the pedophilia in the Catholic Church is a horrible thing. It
is that much worse given that the people involved claim to be morally
superior to others. When Nick says that religion should &lt;em&gt;"know better"&lt;/em&gt;,
I think this is referring to the self-proclaimed moral superiority of
their religion over others in contract to the actions of those making
that claim.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick - if you join a club, you pay your dues, and there are a certain
set of rules for that club to remain in the club. there are certain
definite rules for religious life, but the church will gladly take your
money so you can have your wedding there. they'll take your cash,
regardless of whether you will ever go back to that church again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick - to respect an organization, you need to believe that &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt;
believe in what they are selling. If you are going to have anyone
through your doors, whether they know anything about Jesus for example,
but take their money for weddings this is hypocritical. I would respect
a church a lot more if they would test people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me - Yes, I agree. There is a hypocrisy in the churches, and in the
people, who want the benefits of calling themselves Christian when it
comes to baptism, weddings, and funerals (Hatched, Matched, and
Dispatched), but do not believe in the tennets of the church.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to Peter's comment - What would happen if people followed Jesus'
word seriously?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me - I doubt that Peter really takes Jesus' words seriously. For
example, Matt 19:20 &lt;em&gt;"Jesus answered, "If you want to be perfect, go,
sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure
in heaven. Then come, follow me." "&lt;/em&gt; and Matt 5:18 &lt;em&gt;"For truly I tell
you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the
least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until
everything is accomplished."&lt;/em&gt; which pulls in all of those crazy Old
Testament &lt;em&gt;"kill you for this and that"&lt;/em&gt; commands. Surely Peter will
have some rationalization for not following these, and also not
recognize the process by which he came by these rationalizations. He
probably would not admit that he is the arbiter of these choices, not
the Bible.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Unbelievable Project"></category><category term="Religion"></category><category term="Unbelievable Project"></category></entry><entry><title>Unbelievable Project: The "New Atheism" - Barry Duke and David Marshall Debate</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Mar/13/unbelievable-project-the-new-atheism-barry-duke-and-david-marshall-debate/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-03-13T15:34:00-04:00</published><updated>2013-03-13T15:34:00-04:00</updated><author><name>brianblais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2013-03-13:/posts/2013/Mar/13/unbelievable-project-the-new-atheism-barry-duke-and-david-marshall-debate/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2 id="the-new-atheism-03-november-2007-the-new-atheism-barry-duke-and-david-marshall-debate"&gt;The New Atheism - 03 November 2007 -- The "New Atheism" - Barry Duke and David Marshall Debate&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full Title: &lt;em&gt;Unbelievable? 3 Nov 2007 - The New Atheism - 03
    November 2007 -- The "New Atheism" - Barry Duke and David Marshall
    Debate&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christianity is under attack as never before by a wave of militant
atheists, led by Richard Dawkins. Atheist Barry Duke is all in
favour of it, while Christian David Marshall's book "The Truth
behind the new Atheism" rejects it. They join Justin on the show
as he asks whether Christianity is really as bad as the New
Atheists are making out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://media.premier.org.uk/unbelievable/a92b0e86-c5af-4740-ac40-a7d584ed8843.mp3"&gt;Download mp3.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Justin Brierley - Christian Moderator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;David Marshall - Christian&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Barry Duke - Atheist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gordon Livesey - Atheist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="notes"&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barry - There is nothing new about the atheism. What is new is the
response. This is partly because of 9/11. This event made people realize
what some people would do for their religion. And partly because of the
perception that the US was hijacked by a fundamentalist and given power
through the neo-cons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David - Critical of evolution on social development of religion. Dennett
believes that if you can explain religion then you can &lt;em&gt;"explain it
away"&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me - What is the difference between explaining something and
explaining it away? I'd say this is just model-comparison with different
words. When you have something, like a UFO sighting, and then someone
explains it with mundane events, like a trick of the lights, that is
typically described as explaining it away - you've replaced an
extraordinary explanation with one that is more plausible. This is what
Dennett typically does - he demonstrates a more plausible description of
how certain religious behaviors and experiences can arise from more
mundane phenomena. In this way, explaining it is explaining it "away".
It's just that people who believe the extraordinary explanation don't
like the mundane explanation, so the term "explaining away" has negative
connotations for them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justin - Religion more harm than good? That attitude seems to be new.
Also, this &lt;em&gt;"militant atheism&lt;/em&gt;". Is it just against fundamentalism?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me - When I hear the term &lt;em&gt;"militant atheist"&lt;/em&gt; I can't help but think
of &lt;a href="http://wp.patheos.com.s3.amazonaws.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/files/2009/06/unholy_trinity3.jpg"&gt;this cartoon&lt;/a&gt;. If you campare what you think of with the term
&lt;em&gt;"Miltant Islamist"&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;em&gt;"Militant Atheist"&lt;/em&gt;, it is quite clear there
is a double-standard at work. The only &lt;em&gt;"militant"&lt;/em&gt; part of atheists,
even the most dogmatic ones, is that they have forceful arguments.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barry - No. There is a general feeling that enough is enough or we will
get railroaded by religion in government, education, etc... The new
atheists want to galvanize those people who are effectively
non-believers, bring them to the stand and we can then effect political
change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David - It's ironic not to have religion in the marketplace of ideas or
in education. The university was a religious idea itself. Christianity
has informed society mostly for the good. Separation of church and state
is a Christian idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me - I believe he is referring to &lt;em&gt;Mark 12:17 - "Then Jesus said to
them, "Give back to Caesar what is Caesar's and to God what is God's."
And they were amazed at him."&lt;/em&gt;. There is a long way from that to
&lt;em&gt;"separation of church and state"&lt;/em&gt;. If the separation was truly was a
Christian idea, then I'd expect a totally different European history
from 0 AD to 1700 AD! What a ridiculous claim.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barry - Slavery was supported by Christians and then brought down by
some Christians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David - Slavery is a natural idea and has been part of nearly all
civilizations. Christians have undermined slavery from early on, not
directly but indirectly. Beginning in the fourth century slaves were set
free so that by the eleventh century there were areas of western Europe
free of slaves. This was not imposed on the rest of society. Sixty
percent of anti-slave organizers were Christian pastors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me - It is faint praise indeed that the best you can say about the
Christian stance on slavery, historically, is that some slaves were
freed so that &lt;em&gt;700 years later (!!!)&lt;/em&gt; some small areas in the world,
that didn't feel that they needed slaves anymore, didn't have slaves.
Again, the Bible is quite clear on its perspective with respect to
slavery - it either commands it or condones it, both Old and New
Testament. There is never even a hint of condemnation for the
practice.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gordon - Concerns about Intelligent Design (ID) in the classroom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David - The ID people just want to have an open forum to discuss their
ideas and that it is legitimate to question scientific ideas, even parts
of evolution. That ID isn't a problem most of the time, the issues often
exaggerated. I don't see it as standing in the way of any science or
progress currently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me- David's view of ID is completely at odds with the facts on the
ground about the movement. The clearest description of this was &lt;a href="http://www.pamd.uscourts.gov/kitzmiller/kitzmiller_342.pdf"&gt;the
Judges ruling in the Dover PA case&lt;/a&gt;. Here ID had a chance to present
its best arguments to a jury, and was found wanting at every level. From
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitzmiller_v._Dover_Area_School_District"&gt;the Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;"The ruling concluded that intelligent design
is not science, and permanently barred the board from "maintaining the
ID Policy in any school within the Dover Area School District, from
requiring teachers to denigrate or disparage the scientific theory of
evolution, and from requiring teachers to refer to a religious,
alternative theory known as ID.""&lt;/em&gt; The full ruling showed the ID
proponents for what they are: a group of people who do not shirk from
lying and distortions to achieve their religious-motivated goals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justin. Do you believe that raising a child as religious is child abuse?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barry. There are rare cases where this is definitely a problem. In my
own case I was beaten in South Africa for not participating in Christian
rituals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gordon. My daughteer is six years old, and was upset one day when she
was told off by a teacher. She said &lt;em&gt;"We all have to say grace, and I
didn't say it."&lt;/em&gt; Then the lady in the lunch room pushed her head down
and said &lt;em&gt;"Say your prayers!"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David. Entirely on Barry and Gordon's side. However, in the US it has
been shown that going to church makes people in ghettos less likely in
crime. Yes, there are people who use Christianity to abuse people, but
this goes against what the gospels say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me - I certainly would not call all religious education &lt;em&gt;"child
abuse"&lt;/em&gt;. Corporal punishment (Biblically motivated, or otherwise), yes.
Psychological torture (Biblically motivated, or otherwise), yes. Raising
a child to call themselves Christian, not. As for the benefits, I am
interested in the truth. I imagine that the reduced-crime benefits
described would come from any kind of group membership, regardless of
its religious or secular affiliation. It does not speak to the specific
truth of Christianity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Unbelievable Project"></category><category term="Religion"></category><category term="Unbelievable Project"></category></entry><entry><title>Unbelievable Project: John Lennox debates science and God - Has science buried God?</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Mar/11/unbelievable-project-john-lennox-debates-science-and-god-has-science-buried-god/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-03-11T14:33:00-04:00</published><updated>2013-03-11T14:33:00-04:00</updated><author><name>brianblais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2013-03-11:/posts/2013/Mar/11/unbelievable-project-john-lennox-debates-science-and-god-has-science-buried-god/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2 id="101307-john-lennox-debates-science-and-god-has-science-buried-god"&gt;10/13/07 - John Lennox debates science and God - Has science buried God?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &amp;amp; God - 13 October 2007 -- Has science buried God?&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fresh from a US TV debate with Richard Dawkins, Oxford Professor
Dr. John Lennox engages with atheist scientist Robert Stovold. 
Lennox, who is a Christian, asserts in his book "God's Undertaker
- Has science buried God?" that science and philosophy show
evidence of a divine designer.  Robert Stovold says the
methodology of science is incompatible with such belief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Robert Stovold - Atheist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="notes"&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me - this episode was a lot of work, because both debaters were very
strong and the density of information in this episode is very high - a
lot of information per minute. I had to go back and listen to parts many
times. I particularly like Robert's style - he is very calm and
straightforward, never sounding angry or aggressive. I highly recommend
you listen to the entire debate, because I won't be able to cover
everything here.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert - A common theistic line of argument refers to the appearance of
design, and states things like "the eye cannot occur by chance". If you
think evolution is about randomness, then you don't understand
evolution. If you drop a fish and a lion and drop them on the ground, it
is not random which one will survive, and it doesn't require design to
explain this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert - In the Bible "Love" is defined, both in the Old and New
Testament, in such a way that it always prevails, and always helps.
Then, with 99% of the species that ever existed being extinct, this is
not consistent with a loving God. All of this suffering happened well
before any humans, and Fall, or Noah's flood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John - This is the problem of theodicy. What I would be curious about is
where you even get the idea of right and wrong, because under atheism,
there can be no objective moral standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me - at this point I was jumping up a screaming. Dodge! Dodge! I'd
heard this dodge before, and essentially it ignores the force of the
argument. Robert followed up well, but then added some comments about
where an atheistic morality (as a social construct) comes from. This
derailed the conversation and John never addressed the point. The point
is that, &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; we assume the Bible is true, then the problem of
suffering, as evidenced by the inefficient and wasteful methods of
evolution, leads to a conflict with a loving God. I don't have to even
believe that evil and good exist to make this argument - it is a &lt;em&gt;"spin
out the consequences"&lt;/em&gt; of a worldview and show a conflict. Robert
describes very well how evolution gives the appearance of design -
instead of nudging things in the right direction, evolution nudges
things in &lt;em&gt;"all"&lt;/em&gt; directions and the kills off the directions that don't
work.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert - the war is between naturalism and supernaturalism not between
atheism and God. science ascribes natural causes to natural effects
(methodological naturalism). It isn't that science assumes God doesn't
exist, it simply doesn't include supernatural explanations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John - methodological naturalism is the same as methodological theism.
Dawkins says the world is apparently designed, I say it is designed. It
is only in certain areas, not 99.5% of science, that it makes any
difference. there are good gaps and bad gaps. bad gaps are gaps that
science can close. methodological naturalism is ok but it stops you when
the evidence points beyond naturalism. Two &lt;em&gt;"good gaps"&lt;/em&gt; I would say are
the origin of the universe and the origin of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me - I'd bet real money that the origin of life is a "bad gap", from
John's perspective. In every case where we had a thorny science problem
that seemed insoluble, and we had to resort to "magic" (i.e. &lt;a href="http://www.evaluationtoolkit.org/illustrations/4/original/miracle_cartoon.jpg?1231530108"&gt;this
lovely cartoon&lt;/a&gt;), eventually we have solved it. The origin of life
seems exactly that sort of thing that is amenable to solution. As a
problem, it doesn't suffer from the infinite regress issues from which
origin of the universe solutions can suffer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John - in science it is often very difficult to prove a negative,
although there are cases where (within a reasonable doubt) we can do
that. when I receive a paper outlining in 100 pages a design for a
perpetual motion machine, I don't need to read it. Not because I'm being
an abscurantist, but because the conservation of energy (a
&lt;em&gt;"pro-scriptive law"&lt;/em&gt;) is a principle that has been demonstrated to be
true in all cases, within a reasonably doubt. Now, Sir Peter Meadower
has proposed a conservation of information. nature is very good at
transmitting information, processing and optimizing as is done in
microevolution. where I have difficulty is with the creative process -
those natural processes cannot create information.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me - This is one of the cases where John makes a fundamental science
mistake [see comment below for correction/clarification on this], and
tips his hand to his agenda. In a line, perpetual motion machines do not
violate conservation of energy. They violate the second law of
thermodynamics. Such a basic science error, in my view, disqualifies his
entire scientific credibility - I can't trust that his other scientific
claims, even if I may not have time to track them all down.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also, in a fit of irony, he then goes on to talk about information
which is intricately linked to the second law. It is absolutely not true
that natural processes produce no new information. For example, the
natural development of nylonase is a good example within our lifetime -
bacteria evolved a new enzyme to specifically break down the completely
artificial substance known as nylon.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just as a the formation of ice moves water from a disordered to a more
ordered state, the process of natural selection moves species to a
ordered state -- more in-line with the environment. Information
production, i.e. entropy reduction, happens all of the time in the
natural world.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John - I believe that the fact that the universe is rationally
intelligible is evidence for God. Atheism has no explanation for it, but
theism does. Thus, support for God comes from the bits of science that
we &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; know and not the bits we don't. He is amazed that scientists
stop short of the most important question, simply calling it a brute
fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Me - What is the alternative? Any universe with sustained structures
should be intelligible. A non-intelligible universe would be one with no
patterns - completely random, and thus no structure would ever form.
There is no way we could be thinking beings in an unintelligible
universe. It is also possible that one could not even have an object
that one could label a &lt;/em&gt;"universe"&lt;/em&gt; without it being intelligible.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John - Reductionism undermines the notion of inteligibility.
Intelligibility demands an explanation. &lt;em&gt;"I don't bring god into
science, [...] science points to god in its very existence"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John - On the fine tuning argument, the constants of nature have to be
within &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; close tolerances to get carbon based life. An easier
example is more local. Taking the Earth, if the Earth were spinning
faster we'd all fly off, if slower then we'd all bake to death. If we
were too close to the Sun, it'd be too hot, too far and it's too cold.
These things have to be in very close tolerances. The standard Find
Tuning observation takes this to the Nth degree. This is not an argument
from gaps, its from our knowledge.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert. Theists are trying to have it both ways. On the one hand God's
goal is to create life and on the other hand if it had been slightly
different then life wouldn't be possible. Life's very rare. Imagine a
patio with weeds in the cracks. The weeds would say that the cracks were
put there to support them, ignoring the rest of the patio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert. As for fine tuning, we don't know if the constants are
twiddle-able. Theists will have an explanation either way. If they are
twiddle-able then God was so good to twiddle them correctly. If not,
then the argument would be that God knew what he wanted and dint need to
make a university with changeable constants. Most theistic arguments are
like this - you can explain anything, and thus explain nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lennox. Most scientists respond that the fine tuning does require an
explanation, and often put forward the multiverse explanation even
though there is not a shred of evidence for it. The theistic explanation
is the obvious one that everyone admits, but then they try to come up
with another explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert - once you abandon the law of cause and effect, you can't do
science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me - I agree with Robert the whole way here. I would add, however,
that it may be the case that these constants are in fact &lt;em&gt;not
independent&lt;/em&gt;. Many physicists will state that they are independent,
because in current theory they are, but they may not be in some future
theory. Thus, it might be that not only are they not twiddle-able but
they might not be &lt;em&gt;separately&lt;/em&gt; twiddle-able, and thus life may be
possible in all possible universes. Finally, as an analogy, if we look
at pre-Copernican astronomy with all of the epicycles on epicycles, a
scientist at that time would find it very difficult to fathom that all
of that independent detail could be derived from two equations (Newton's
3rd Law, and the theory of gravitation). Another analogy would be the
independent spectral lines of each type of material, used in the 1800's
for spectroscopy, being explained by the single Schoedinger equation! We
have many examples of so-called independent observations not actually
being independent when we have a full understanding.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Unbelievable Project"></category><category term="Fine Tuning"></category><category term="Religion"></category><category term="Science"></category><category term="Unbelievable Project"></category></entry><entry><title>Unbelievable Project: God Delusion debate - Deluded by Dawkins?</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Mar/08/unbelievable-project-god-delusion-debate-deluded-by-dawkins/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-03-08T12:17:00-05:00</published><updated>2013-03-08T12:17:00-05:00</updated><author><name>brianblais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2013-03-08:/posts/2013/Mar/08/unbelievable-project-god-delusion-debate-deluded-by-dawkins/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2 id="82407-god-delusion-debate-deluded-by-dawkins"&gt;8/24/07 - God Delusion debate - Deluded by Dawkins?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full Title: &lt;em&gt;Unbelievable? 25 Aug 2007 - God Delusion debate - 25
    August 2007 -- Deluded by Dawkins?&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Wilson's new book claims to have debunked Richard Dawkins'
arguments against God. He goes head to head with atheist Gordon
Livesey as they discuss The God Delusion and whether people are
really being deluded by Dawkins' arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://media.premier.org.uk/unbelievable/d8d19c39-5ea7-4ac9-8746-8b7c000c8f5a.mp3"&gt;Download mp3.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Justin Brierley - Christian Moderator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Andrew Wilson - Christian&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gordon Livesey - Atheist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="notes"&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew - many things I agree with Dawkins. Religions should debate their
points, and not be immune from criticism. I agree with his criticisms of
extreme versions of Christianity, although it seems as if Dawkins goes
out of his way to find the most extreme and illiterate unconvincing
examples of religious conviction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew- problems,&lt;br&gt;
1. implied trajectory of religiosity&lt;br&gt;
2. stridency of the book&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me - 35 minutes into the show so far, and there hasn't been an actual
challenge to a claim of Dawkins. Only criticisms of tone, and perceived
insinuation. I find this is typical of many of the criticisms of the
&lt;em&gt;"New Atheists"&lt;/em&gt; - people complain about the tone, and not the actual
content of the arguments. I find it helpful to focus on the actual
claims, and not the tone. Everything else is a distraction.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gordon - one of the strong statements of Dawkins is on the subject of
theology, which he says really isn't a subject at all. it is not based
on science, and is simply based on old texts. Dawkins relates a story
where the physics professor, when asked about what started the Big Bang,
threw a sop to the theologian and suggested that the chaplain would be
better able to answer. Dawkins' response was like, &lt;em&gt;"Why would the
chaplain know anything about this? Surely a physics professor should
know more. "&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew - that explains a lot. if you don't have any respect for a field,
then you will be much less likely to read the actual work, and will make
errors (Dawkins mistakes Matthew for Luke when relaying the wise men
story, mistaken on a contradiction of the birthplace stated in Matthew
and Luke, mistaken on Thomas Jefferson referring to the Dead Sea
Scrolls, etc...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew - We can ask questions like, why did the jews of the first
century which didn't believe in the two stage resurrection start
referring to Jesus' resurrection? There might be secular responses to
questions like that, but we have to take them seriously and not simply
dismiss them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me - That's history, not theology.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gordon - theology just doesn't stand up when compared to physics,
chemistry, history, etc...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew - anti-supernaturalism perspectives, by definition, cannot have
any miracles. origins, infinite improbability of god.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me - I don't think that Andrew understands Dawkins' argument for the
improbability of God. Essentially, any probability that you assign for
the the universe because of its complexity must be greater than the
probability you assign for the &lt;em&gt;necessarily more complex&lt;/em&gt; creator of the
universe.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gordon - I do believe that miracles could not happen, and they never
have. Much that was attributed to miracles is explained by science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew - Lack of belief in miracles is not new. Some say in the New
Testament, that the people who believed in the Resurrection were mad.
Dawkins implies that Hume put the death nail in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew - an atheist friend said &lt;em&gt;"If I accepted that miracles occur,
then I'd have to change the entire way I view the physical world"&lt;/em&gt; (this
is in response to a story of a miraculous healing of a women's hearing
at a prayer meeting). Dawkins is the same way - he is just unwilling to
believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gordon - No, Dawkins doesn't say this - he always insists that if you
can show him good evidence, then he'd believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justin - but whatever evidence you bring forward, that looks just like a
miracle, Dawkins will write off that there must be an alternative
explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gordon - he's going on previous evidence, making further miracle claims
unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew - Some people made some wrong claims about X, therefore X cannot
be true. (Gordon - unlikely to be true) Some people made up a ridiculous
story of a &lt;em&gt;"miracle"&lt;/em&gt; of an elephant drinking milk, therefore miracles
cannot happen, therefore the Resurrection didn't happen, therefore there
is no God - shaky foundation. We should look at at the historical
evidence, without prohibition against miracles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew - I don't assume the Resurrection. I don't assume miracles, but I
have seen healings, so I believe based on the evidence. We should be
open to miracles as an explanation, and not dismiss them entirely &lt;em&gt;"by
definition"&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me - I think that we have to separate the idea of an observed
phenomenon and the cause of that phenomenon, to be clear. When saying
&lt;em&gt;"miracle"&lt;/em&gt; we conflate the two. We can possibly test an effect, even if
we can't test a supernatural cause.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A number of examples were discussed, mostly faith healings. Now, I
believe that Andrew would agree that not all miracle claims are true,
and not all faith healings are legitimate. The question then becomes,
how can we tell the difference between true and false claims? How are
false claims produced? The way we can tell is if we can repeat them, or
have some independent verification. Every attempt I have ever seen to
carefully study faith healings has come up empty. Now, some diseases can
disappear on their own or have completely subjective symptoms. Other
diseases cannot - missing limbs, removed/damaged organs, etc... There is
not a single case of a regrown limb or organ in all of the faith healing
literature. Every case is indistinguishable from no effect. Take, for
example, the story of the suddenly hearing woman. How do we know that
her hearing didn't come back the previous week, and she only pointed it
out at the healing mass? How do we know that she had actually lost her
hearing? This could easily be the case of a pious fraud - she interprets
an increase in hearing around the time of a prayer meeting to being
caused by the prayer meeting. It could easily have been fabricated too.
How could we distinguish these explanations? The only way is through
objectively obtained evidence, the exact kind that we do not have in any
of these cases.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here's a suggestion - I'd be convinced of a miracle if it can pass the
&lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/1m-challenge/challenge-faq.html"&gt;JREF test&lt;/a&gt;. Since none have, I am well within my rational grounds to
immediately dismiss any such claims as miraculous until such time as
they pony up the evidence.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full Title: &lt;em&gt;Unbelievable? 18 Aug 2007 - Atheist and Christian
    bloggers discuss - 18 August 2007 -- Two bloggers discuss God, faith
    &amp;amp; Church - Ian Thorpe &amp;amp; Jenni Hutchinson&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ian Thorpe is an atheist and Jenni Hutchinson a Christian. They
got chatting about faith after bumping into each other on the
internet. They discuss whether the church is having a beneficial
effect on society, Ian's concerns over "fundamentalism" and
whether you need to believe in God to be good.&lt;br&gt;
 See Ian's blog athttp://machiavelli.blog.co.uk/See Jenni's blog

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Justin Brierley - Christian Moderator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jenni Hutchinson - Christian&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ian Thorpe - Atheist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="notes"&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ian - He's concerned about the rise of Fundamentalism, and feels that
you don't have to be a theist to be good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenni - Jesus as an icon (like clicking Excel - it leads to you to
Excel). It is easier to be good when one is in a community , get
support, etc... Also one should take the lesson from Jesus, and not act
superior or shun those that are sinful but engage them in dialog and
offer help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me - religions have had hundreds of years of constructing communities
and support structures that just aren't there for atheists. humans need
community, and you get a lot of those benefits from being in a religious
community.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justin - I believe that we have an innate selfishness. Theologically we
attribute this to the Fall, and it comes out very early on. Hopefully
society helps to inculcate us with some values, but it does seem as if
this selfishness is getting worse. What's the solution to that? Can we
help ourselves, or do we need someone else? I would say that as a
Christian that Jesus Christ is what makes the difference, that's where
you have a hope of seeing change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me - It might turn out that, for some people, they need to
believe that there is someone there even when the isn't anyone there.
This, however, does not speak to the truth of it. I'd ask, would a
Christian have the same positive attitude if you replace Jesus Christ in
the above with Allah - would you be supportive of more Islam in your
community, because of the positive influence it has on youth, turning
them around, because they come to recognize the power of Allah? It seems
to me that this is another case of &lt;em&gt;"if you agree with me, I want more
of you, otherwise, no thanks."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, knowing this about human psychology, we could figure out a way
of getting the benefits without all of the superstitious

&lt;p&gt;Full Title: &lt;em&gt;Unbelievable? 23 Jun 2007 - God's existence, free will
    &amp;amp; faith - 23 June 2007 -- The Big Questions&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justin Brierley is joined by Jonathan Hill, author of "The Big
Questions". The book tackles some of the biggest philosophical
questions to do with the existence of God, free-will and faith.
What can we learn from the way Christians down the ages have
attempted to answer these questions? With guests Tim Mawson of
Oxford University and Jim Paul of the L'Abri fellowship in
Hampshire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Justin Brierley - Christian Moderator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jonathan Hill, Jonathan, Tim Mawson, Jim Paul - Christian&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(none) - Atheist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="notes"&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim - personal experience can be evidence for God's existence, like the
perception of a table is evidence of a table. it's a phenomenon,
although it can be tricky to map it to reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me - the idea is one of verifiability, which distinguishes these sorts
of things. Tim points out that many have had personal experiences to
verify other religions. This, in a single stroke, eliminates it as a
reasonable form of evidence.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonathan - three biggies historically. cosmological - God must exist
because the Universe must have a cause. , God is by definition uncaused,
a necessary being. the universe could have not existed (nothing), or a
different one, so it is contingent. this must come from a necessary
being. - I'm not very convinced of arguments of this kind - it doesn't
really prove God, but some &lt;em&gt;"first thing"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me - I agree! however, I am not convinced with this contingent,
necessary distinction. can we demonstrate it? Can we find an example? Is
it a meaningful distinction?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonathan - teleological - argument from design. quotes from Marcus
Minucius Felix late 2nd century&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;"hold up your eyes to starry heavens, behold the planets wheeling in
their pre-ordained course. look at the turning of the seasons, the rain
and the snow, the sun, the planets, everything works together."&lt;/em&gt; how
could you look at that say that there is no God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me - each of these is described &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; by physics and biology. this
argument from incredulity is not a solid argument. and we easily
recognize this now.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonathan - ontological. there is a God based on a definition of God. God
is defined as perfection. one of the perfections is necessary existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me (and Justin) - just saying it doesn't make it so. this point was
responded to, by asserting that &lt;em&gt;"we are simply exploring the concept"&lt;/em&gt;.
However, the objection still holds even in this case.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Unbelievable Project"></category><category term="Religion"></category><category term="Unbelievable Project"></category></entry><entry><title>Unbelievable Project: Does Christianity enslave? - Are we better off without belief in God?</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Mar/01/unbelievable-project-does-christianity-enslave-are-we-better-off-without-belief-in-god/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-03-01T10:51:00-05:00</published><updated>2013-03-01T10:51:00-05:00</updated><author><name>brianblais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2013-03-01:/posts/2013/Mar/01/unbelievable-project-does-christianity-enslave-are-we-better-off-without-belief-in-god/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As part of the &lt;a href="https://brianblais.wordpress.com/2013/02/27/unbelievable-project-a-non-believers-armchair-perspective-on-six-years-of-christian-debates/"&gt;Unbelievable Project&lt;/a&gt;, I am taking notes and

&lt;p&gt;Duncan Rossiter runs an atheist website. He says that Christinaity
enslaves people. Find out why he has a problem with the idea of God
and whether Christian evangelist Paul Clarke can persuade him that
faith in Christ sets people free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Justin Brierley - Christian Moderator&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Duncan Rossiter - Atheist&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My responses in &lt;strong&gt;bold&lt;/strong&gt;, quotes in &lt;em&gt;italic&lt;/em&gt;, and the rest is a
    paraphrase. I may change this formatting convention as I go through
    the project in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duncan - &lt;em&gt;"hard to be an atheist - people are shocked when they hear"&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;em&gt;"Primarily belief based on indoctrination at an early age rather than
at an age when you can make decisions for yourself."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul - &lt;em&gt;"saying you're a Christian, as opposed to Muslim or Hindu, you
get the same sort of reaction."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question to Duncan - &lt;em&gt;"why would we be better off without belief in
God?"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justin - &lt;em&gt;"Do you feel that you've lost something? Does it make one sad
that this is all we have?"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duncan - As a race, why are we better off? Middle East, Ireland, obvious
issues. Asking people to pray when they could be doing something
themselves. You can, as an atheist, investigate any other truth claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul - the Christian is allowed to investigate anything. &lt;em&gt;"atheism is an
absolute truth claim just as the faith claims."&lt;/em&gt; Stalin and Mao
connected to their atheism?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me - What is clear is that dogmatic thinking, whether religious or
atheistic, leads to suffering. however, religion by its very structure
celebrates dogmatism, whereas modern scientific (i.e. skeptical)
thinking abhors it wherever it is seen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul - &lt;em&gt;"what hitler did was not in accord of Christian beliefs"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me - The bible is a multiple-choice text. You can find anything in it,
so it can be used to justify the worst behavior and the best behavior.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul - &lt;em&gt;"the 20th century was an experiment in secularism, and the
result was secular evil more virulent than what came before."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul - people take belief systems and use them for evil. Christianity is
not inherently evil. there is evil in the human heart. the problem is
with selfish people who might come along and use christianity or any
other belief systems for there end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duncan - human beings will do evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul - why haven't we evolved out of that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me - even asking this question shows a remarkable ignorance about how
evolution works. first, we are effectively the same humans now (from an
evolution standpoint) as we were when we left africa. so why would we
expect to have &lt;em&gt;"evolved out of that?"&lt;/em&gt; second, it is clear that a
&lt;em&gt;balance&lt;/em&gt; of selfish tendencies and societal, non-selfish, tendencies
leads to success in social creatures like us. therefore, we are still
stuck with those selfish tendencies. I am not convinced that if we were
able to eliminate this, that this would necessarily be a good thing
overall. it could be that this selfish, competitive, aspect gives us the
motivation to find creative solutions to problems about which we might
otherwise be complacent.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul - second hand belief and disbelief, from parents, community, needs
to be scrutinized and figured out yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul - atheism has no objective way of determining right from wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duncan - God supposedly created everything, absolutely everything, knows
us, and what we are going to do and yet there are people starving that
he could have saved. He must be in control of these things but I have
not seen any answers out there from Christianity for &lt;em&gt;"why the evil, why
at all?"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul - agrees that God knows these things, and that the evil is allowed
to happen for a reason. In man-made evil, is not directly caused by God
(because of free will). on natural evil, he asks &lt;em&gt;"do you think there is
enough food in the world to feed everyone in the world?"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me - absolutely yes. it's just not distributed properly. and that
doesn't get God off the hook, because he could easily make the soil more
fertile, etc... in the places without enough food currently.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duncan - if people prayed a little less and do a little more, then
things would be improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul - you can pray and do, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duncan - prayer is a waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul - prayer is the sort of activity that makes yourself more into the
type of person that could help. if prayer is a waste of time, do you do
anything that wastes time? Certainly you could do more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul - is there ever a justification for allowing suffering? yes, like a
nurse giving a shot, to allow for a higher goal. so, is there a higher
goal, to justify the suffering? if there were one, then it would have to
be pretty big and pretty important. the christian answer to it is the
higher goal in question is the glory of god. somehow, all of these
things work together for the glory of god.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duncan - maybe my brain is not wired right, but I don't see how people
dying people for the glory of god, even if they do not believe or ever
heard of &lt;em&gt;"your god"&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul - we are seeing the back of the tapestry, not the front. the messy
side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul - to strictly be an atheist and to make the absolute truth claim
that there is nowhere anywhere in the universe a god you need complete
knowledge and ethical perfection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me - what a ridiculous straw man. replace &lt;em&gt;"God"&lt;/em&gt; in this sentence
with &lt;em&gt;"Fairy"&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;"Unicorn"&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;"Zeus"&lt;/em&gt; and you'll immediately see
why.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justin - what about the positive impact, when they found christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duncan - what about the positive impact of atheism?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me - is there anything that you believe in, strongly, for which the
&lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; evidence you have are stories in ancient texts?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Unbelievable Project"></category><category term="Religion"></category><category term="Unbelievable Project"></category></entry><entry><title>Unbelievable Project: A Non-Believer's Armchair Perspective on Six Years of Christian Debates</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Feb/27/unbelievable-project-a-non-believers-armchair-perspective-on-six-years-of-christian-debates/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-02-27T14:30:00-05:00</published><updated>2013-02-27T14:30:00-05:00</updated><author><name>brianblais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2013-02-27:/posts/2013/Feb/27/unbelievable-project-a-non-believers-armchair-perspective-on-six-years-of-christian-debates/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I've decided to start a project which will be posted here as I go

along. Essentially, it is based off of the &lt;a href="http://www.premierradio.org.uk/shows/saturday/unbelievable.aspx"&gt;Unbelievable podcast&lt;/a&gt;,
which for those who don't know is a British podcast/radio show featuring
debates between Christians and non-Christians. My plan is to respond to
every episode from the archive, with some small constraints. I expect
this will take at least a year, possibly a bit more, but structure many
of my ideas as I go through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are quite simple for which episodes I will address, and which
parts of the episodes I'll addresss:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I will listen to just the debate, not the emails or the call-ins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I will only listen to atheist vs Christian debates, not Christian vs
    Christian debates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I will only listen to Christian topics, not Islam, Hindu, Paganism,
    or other religious topics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These rules are set for my own personal interest, and also to play to my
strengths. I am not as informed of the intricacies of Hinduism, for
example. I am also not interested in hearing a discussion between
Christians about the particular implications of the Trinity.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Unbelievable Project"></category><category term="Religion"></category><category term="Unbelievable Project"></category></entry></feed>
