I am still grappling with this news, hitting me harder than I expected.  However, why wouldn't I expect to be shaken by this news?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first met Leon Cooper at Brown University in 1994, me still a new graduate student in Physics in my second semester.  I had come to Brown to either study astrophysics or to study with Leon Cooper who was working on models of the brain.  He had won the Nobel Prize for his work on Superconductivity, and was working now on computational neuroscience -- a field that basically didn't exist when he started to work on it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was always interested in the "big questions" and both astrophysics and neuroscience spoke to these questions.  I interviewed with another graduate student in Leon Cooper's lab at the time, Mike Perrone, who put me on a project during my second semester  -- presumably to see if I could hack it in the lab.  I did contribute to his project, and presented my work at a conference.  Leon Cooper then offered me a summer stipend where I would work on understanding some of the recent work of Charles Law and Harel Shouval, who had been doing simulations of synaptic plasticity in the visual system.   That was 1994 -- 30 years ago.  This semester, now 2024, I submitted for a conference presentation using some of the same models I was introduced to in 1994.  This speaks to the strength of the BCM synaptic plasticity model (named after the 1982 authors Bienenstock, Cooper, and Munro) and to the influence Leon Cooper has had both in the field of neuroscience and my own professional life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Brown University Physics Department had a "qualifying exam" the September of one's second year as a graduate student.  It consisted of a 2-day written exam followed by a possible oral exam.   If you scored above a 70 on the written exam, you'd pass outright.  If you got between a 60 and a 70 you'd have an oral exam.  Below a 60, you'd fail and have another chance six months later.  I got a 55 on the exam.  I was able to argue for 5 more points, due to questions being unclear or me approaching problems in a different way than expected.  After the new points, I had achieved a 60 on the qualifying exam -- the minimum for an oral exam.   A few days later, I have my oral exam with three professors, including Leon Cooper.  The stakes were whether I could stay at Brown University for physics.  I don't remember a lot about that exam, other than that it was one and a half hours, I blanked on some questions, and felt confident on others.  I distinctly recall Leon's questioning style -- one that I have adopted whenever I give oral exams.  He would ask a super-easy question, one where to get it wrong really should result in a failing grade.   Then he'd add a small complication, and ask a follow-up question.  After several of these step-ups, until you couldn't answer the question, he had a very good measure of what you knew while at the same time removing the effect of being nervous or blanking on a topic momentarily.  This process of starting easy, and moving up in small steps, was a brilliant measurement method for determining someone's aptitude in a topic.  It was one of many things that Leon did gently and brilliantly and that I have tried to emulate since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the exam, I went up to the lab wondering if I would be able to stay, not at all confident in my performance.   I sat down, and wrote out one of the answers I had blanked on.  I still tell my students that I can more easily write things on paper than in front of a whiteboard.  Leon came up to tell me the result of the discussion, and he said that the consensus was that I was borderline and that if he decided to pass me, I'd be "his problem now", smiling and lightly laughing as he did when bemused.  He did pass me which has affected my entire life trajectory since.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a letter I wrote for Leon's 80th birthday I told him  "although I know that I am, at best, a mediocre physicist you have always made me feel as if I were much better."  It was always clear that Leon Cooper had a way of looking at the world that was far deeper and clearer than anything I could approach.   In neuroscience seminars, I watched as he listened to a graduate student or postdoc present their research and then ask them such a penetrating question that they were taken aback.  He was able to slice through all of the complexities that biologists are trained to focus on and find a problem or solution about their research question that they had never considered.  It was a skill of making things as "simple as possible but no simpler", a la Einstein, and Leon had an ability to do this across the multiple disciplines of physics and biology that was worthy of two Nobel Prizes, in my opinion.  Yet, in our personal interactions, he never made me feel like I was in any way inferior to him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of my fondest memories are from our weekly meetings, which lasted until February 2020, stopping due to Covid.  Even when he wasn't as active in research, he was always interested to hear the latest work that I was doing.  Given my teaching and service obligations, my research has been somewhat glacial on certain topics, but Leon was always interested.  We spoke about the interpretation of quantum mechanics, a topic he loved and that I was also interested in but had far less aptitude than he.   We also had a shared interest in the methods of teaching different topics in physics.  I made an audiobook of the recordings of his class "Physics: Structure and Meaning".  Ironically, I hadn't listened to it in quite a while, but had picked it up this week again before I had heard the news of his passing.  I love Leon's approach to teaching of telling historical anecdotes, and leading the students through the thought process the scientists had as they developed the current theories.   He did this, rather than just provide them the answers, to give them a connection to the material that I don't think any textbook or YouTube video could rival.  Leon Cooper was the quintessential teacher, and was in a unique position to inform his teaching with his experience unraveling some of the fundamental mysteries in physics earning him his Nobel Prize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is no exaggeration to say that Leon Cooper has been the most important person to my professional career, always supportive even when I knew that I was not performing up to the potential I could have.  I have always striven to be like him -- clear in his vision of how the universe works, passionate about teaching, always able to see through to the essential important issues whether that was in physics or biology, and gentle to the core.  I never heard him raise his voice in the 30 years I've known him, yet he was always clear in expressing when he disagreed with a point.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many things, our weekly meetings were disrupted by Covid and then Leon was ill for a while.  I met with him once at his house in 2021.  I regret not making it a priority to visit more often.  I wish I could have communicated to him how much he has meant top me, and still means to me and that so much of the way I think and work and appreciate this life comes from him.  I was already missing Leon, and knowing that I won't have any more discussions over coffee with him breaks my heart.  I will always be thankful for the happy accident that brought us together and for his wonderful presence in my life.  I will always remember him, and with the wonders of modern technology, I get to hear his teaching voice anytime I want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will always remember Leon and the influence he had in my life.  With Leon Cooper, thus passes one of the most amazing humans that has ever lived, and I have been blessed to have crossed part of his path on my own journey, for which I am eternally thankful.  Farewell Leon.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="science"></category></entry><entry><title>A poor introduction to Bayesian Reasoning</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2024/Jan/22/a-poor-introduction-to-bayesian-reasoning/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-01-22T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2024-01-22T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2024-01-22:/posts/2024/Jan/22/a-poor-introduction-to-bayesian-reasoning/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've had my disagreements with Jonathan McLatchie a few times, some of it &lt;a href="{filename}What would convince me.md"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and now there is another interview &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATvPk4Tx_pA&amp;amp;list=WL&amp;amp;index=3"&gt;Bayesian Probability and Intelligent Design: A Beginner's Guide&lt;/a&gt; that someone …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've had my disagreements with Jonathan McLatchie a few times, some of it &lt;a href="{filename}What would convince me.md"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and now there is another interview &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATvPk4Tx_pA&amp;amp;list=WL&amp;amp;index=3"&gt;Bayesian Probability and Intelligent Design: A Beginner's Guide&lt;/a&gt; that someone forwarded to me. In this interview he starts off by answering the fairly straightforward question "what is Bayes theorem and how does it relate to our understanding of evidence?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bayes theorem is a way of probabilistically modeling our assessment of evidence and how we update our confidence and conclusions in response to new data so the way that a Bayesian  would conceptualize evidence is in terms of a likelihood ratio that is to say the probability of the evidence existing given the hypothesis is true on the numerator and then on the denominator we have the probability that that same evidence exists given that the hypothesis is false and to the extent that that likelihood ratio is top heavy that is the extent to which you have evidence for your hypothesis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I find astounding about this opening response is the massive hole that Jonathan leaves -- the prior.  He addresses it later, but if you're specifically asked about Bayes Theorem and you only talk about likelihoods, that is a serious omission.  If I were asked the question, I would have answered it as I did in my &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3xAb3aVGVM0"&gt;TEDx talk on the issue&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bayes theorem states that a belief in a particular explanation should scale with &lt;em&gt;how well that explanation fits the data&lt;/em&gt; (called the likelihood),  it should also scale with &lt;em&gt;how plausible that explanation was before you saw any data&lt;/em&gt; (the prior), and it should be scaled down by all of the alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why does this opener strike me as bad?  There are two reasons.  The first I mentioned already, the lack of mentioning a prior.  We can see the result of ignoring the prior by examining the example McLatchie says here, one that &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2022/Jan/24/ongoing-conversation-with-jonathan-mclatchie/#enter-jean-luc"&gt;he has used before&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;imagine that you were hiking in a forest in somewhere and you're far away from roads and civilizations and you come across a cabin in the middle of this forest and you wonder whether it is inhabited and so you decide to inspect and you prize open the door and you find a cup of English breakfast tea that that is still steeping, it is not at room temperature,  on the table inside this cabin.   On the hypothesis that the cabin is inhabited would you have predicted strongly that you would find a cup of specifically English breakfast tea still seeping on this table? Well, no, it's actually quite a low probability on the hypothesis that it's inhabited that you would make that observation nonetheless it is far more probable on the hypothesis that the cabin is inhabited that you would make that observation than it would otherwise be if the cabin is not inhabited -- then it's astronomically improbable that you would make that observation. So again you have this, even though the numerator is not particularly high, you nonetheless in this case have a very strongly top-heavy likelihood ratio such that the evidence overwhelmingly confirms the hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my earlier response to this (where McLatchie used Earl Grey tea in his examle), I introduced the hypothesis that Jean Luc Picard had visited and everyone knows that he likes his &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2IJdfxWtPM"&gt;"tea, Earl Gray, hot"&lt;/a&gt;.  Because of this, the likelihood of the evidence on this hypothesis is much higher than either of the alternatives that McLatchie gives -- does this mean he strongly believes in Jean Luc Picard?  What's the problem?  McLatchie consistently ignores priors.  I do wonder if he changed the type of tea because of my response.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second problem with the opener has to do with alternatives.  Through rest of the interview he deals only with ratios, and he naively mentions independence,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if the initial ratio were 2 to one then if you had 10 pieces of such evidence and they were all independent then the cumulative power of the evidence would be more than 1,000 to one and so you can see that if you have lots of different pieces of evidence each by themselves not being a particularly great weight they can amount to cumulatively a very powerful cumulative case for the hypothesis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What he says is mathematically correct if 1) you have only one alternative and 2) if the data is indeed independent.  The first comes from a naive application of Bayes theorem, and ignoring the fact that &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2022/Jan/18/bad-apologetics/#bayes-factors-and-confidence"&gt;some non-monotonic effects can occur when you have more than two hypothesis&lt;/a&gt;.  The second is often stated and, except for some obvious simple cases, is no often true.  Even if there is a small uncertainty in whether you can establish data points as independent &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2023/Feb/23/probability-and-the-independence-of-testimony/"&gt;you can come to radically different answers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The net effect of ignoring, or downplaying, priors and only working in two-hypothesis problems is to sweep these sorts of complexities under the rug.  Applying Bayes in these cases also distracts one from the fact that the hypotheses McLatchie is proposing &lt;em&gt;makes no unique predictions&lt;/em&gt;.  Go through everything McLatchie has said, and note how many times he has proposed an experiment to test directly the design hypothesis -- it's zero as far as I can tell, not just for McLatchie but for all of the ID proponents.   They will try to point out that a particular evolutionary mechanism can't explain a phenomenon, but they never put forward the positive case.  It is the classic God-of-the-Gaps move.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since McLatchie himself says he's not doing God of the Gaps and is putting forward a positive case, I feel that this topic requires its own response which I will work on later.  Until then, the deficiencies in the way that he describes Bayesian probability and applies Bayes theorem itself are cause to doubt his conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="religion"></category></entry><entry><title>What would I expect to be in the Bible?</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2023/Dec/02/what-would-i-expect-to-be-in-the-bible/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-12-02T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-12-02T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2023-12-02:/posts/2023/Dec/02/what-would-i-expect-to-be-in-the-bible/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've read the entire Bible twice, the &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2023/Aug/14/bible-in-a-year/"&gt;most recent time this past year&lt;/a&gt;.

Both times I was underwhelmed by the content in the book.  It had so much barbarism, and was barely inspiring even at its best points.  I wrote in my notes &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There is nothing in the Bible that even suggests that the person writing this knew more than me or anyone else in history, let alone an omniscient being.  If someone could point to anything in this book that indicates omniscient input, I'd love to hear it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what would I expect?  I don't know specifically, but when I read a newsletter by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolyn_Porco"&gt;Carolyn Porco&lt;/a&gt; an idea struck me.  Here was a mere mortal, one of 8 billion, writing something more inspiring and prescient while being entirely accurate, communicating a message of thanks that far surpasses anything in the Bible.  If this can be done by mere people, why do we think this couldn't have been accomplished in spades by an all-knowing being who supposedly created the universe?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow will be Thanksgiving Day in the US ... the day that we Americans pause to express thanks for all those things that make our lives and our time on this planet meaningful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To take reckoning of your own life, and all the wonder-filled moments and events, both personal and not, and the opportunities and knowledge -- yes, knowledge! -- you have gained from them, and to dwell on and be grateful for all of it, is a salve for the heart and soul. One of the most effective practices of gratitude for me starts outdoors, on a clear, dark night, gazing up at a starlit sky and absorbing its message. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I repeat here what I wrote on Facebook on Dec 20, 2022, prior to the Great Conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn two days later:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Be sure to spend some time reveling in the rarity of the moment, the beauty of the starlit skies of our planet, the antiquity of the Universe, and how fortunate we all are to have the celestial wonders that surround us ... our planetary neighbors, the very distant stars and nebulae in our own galaxy, all the billions upon billions of immensely distant galaxies ... laid out before our eyes in such glorious splendor. The night sky is the only scene we can savor that is 13.8 billion years old. No experience can better convey the profundity and significance of our own limited existence and the improbable blessing of being alive, than gazing, with knowledge and acceptance, upon its starry countenance."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is enough gratitude to be had in that magnificent view and what it has taught us to last a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that tomorrow and be sure to have a Happy Thanksgiving! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="notes"&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter - outlines the argument from first cause:{.theist}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;everything that begins to exist has a cause{.theist}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the universe has a beginning{.theist}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;therefore the universe has a cause (i.e. creator){.theist}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the creator must be uncaused, and must be an agent to create, therefore must be a personal mind.{.theist}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This argument is totally unconvincing to me, and I doubt many really have faith due to this argument.  What are my biggest problems?  Here is a short list:{.me}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"everything that begins to exist has a cause" - this is stated, but never demonstrated.  In fact, there are uncaused events in quantum mechanics.{.me}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"the universe has a beginning" - our universe, perhaps, had a singularity where time and space started.  Is that a beginning?  Perhaps.  Perhaps it is part of a multi-verse that is eternal, and this is just one event in it.  Given this possibility, even this claim doesn't do what he'd like it to do{.me}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"therefore the universe has a cause"  - let's, for the sake of argument, go along with this statement.  Does it really tell us about the nature of the cause?  It could be a natural cause, but something out of time and space.  There could be some other dimension, or nature, that we don't understand -- still natural -- that causes universes.  It does not require a mind, and thus does not require any personality.{.me}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has Peter demonstrated that minds can exist outside of a body?  Is there even a &lt;em&gt;single&lt;/em&gt; example of this?{.me}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter - in the Genesis story of creation, the description is &lt;em class="tq"&gt;"astonishingly close to what science says"&lt;/em&gt;.  Talking about the &lt;em&gt;"spirit moving across the water"&lt;/em&gt;, he claims Genesis fits a picture of when a planet first forms, completely blackened out, where the light doesn't get through - as he claims we see planet formation today.  So we can understand the "let there be light", but the Sun comes later through the clouds, and then you get vegetation, life in the sea, land animals, and then man.  This is an &lt;em class="tq"&gt;"extraordinary process of development for a primitive people to have stumbled on"&lt;/em&gt;} {.theist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is convincing to him, and is astonishing and extraordinary? Really? Here's a summary of the days of Creation from &lt;a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1&amp;amp;version=RSV"&gt;Genesis 1&lt;/a&gt;:{.me}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Day 1 - the heavens and the earth, light, day and night{.me}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Day 2 - firmament (i.e. solid dome) for the sky {.me}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Day 3 - land and seas, vegetation {.me}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Day 4 - stars, sun, moon{.me}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Day 5 - fish and birds {.me}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Day 6 - land animals, man and woman{.me}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Day 7 - resting{.me}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we are going to overlook the fact that &lt;a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+2&amp;amp;version=RSV"&gt;Genesis 2&lt;/a&gt; has a different order, where animals are created &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; humans.  Even the order in &lt;a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1&amp;amp;version=RSV"&gt;Genesis 1&lt;/a&gt; leaves a lot to be desired.  Peter claims that the day and night before the sun is due to the sun not being able to shine down through the clouds, which is not even &lt;em&gt;hinted&lt;/em&gt; at in the text and is a desperate move of harmonization.  Further, this list of creation has plants before the sun, so either way you have a problem - the plants could not have grown before the sun poked through the clouds even if we take Peter's strained reading of the text.  The Earth is not separated to the heavens by a "firmament" (i.e. solid dome), and there are not holes in that firmament for the starlight.  According to our best understanding, land animals came before birds and fish came before vegetation.  This account doesn't even remotely sound like science to me.  {.me}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put another way, if this description of creation was so close to what modern science says about the universe, why did it take thousands of years for people to recognize that the Earth went around the Sun, and that the Sun was part of a Galaxy?  If you read the &lt;a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1&amp;amp;version=RSV"&gt;Genesis 1&lt;/a&gt; account, and knew nothing else in the world, would it suggest to you that there are other planets?  What about galaxies?  Does it suggest the time scales between the formation of the universe and the formation of the Earth?  Does it suggest that the Sun is a star or that the Moon is a rock whereas the Sun is a ball of plasma?   Does it suggest, even remotely, any process of evolution?  The answer is a clear &lt;em&gt;No&lt;/em&gt;.{.me}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter is engaged in the worst sort of cherry-picking and rose-colored (or more appropriately, science-colored) glasses all the way down.{.me}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter - In the face of the spread and success of Christianity, doesn't this suggest that there is a truth there?  {.theist}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truth is not decided by success of transmission.  Both Mormonism and Islam have had very recent success in spreading, and yet Christians don't take them seriously.  Truth should cross borders, like science does, and things that are cultural don't (as much).  This leads to the structure, pointed out by Dawkins, that you are much more likely to be the religion of your culture, so the geographic distribution of religious tendencies tends to be fragmented, as opposed to scientific ideas which do not follow that pattern at all.{.me}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John - The Christian &lt;em&gt;story&lt;/em&gt; is really good, which may explain why it spreads successfully.{.atheist}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How would you distinguish an idea which true versus one that is a good cultural story and is thus successful but not necessarily true?  Ideas can be popular they are imposed from above, or are tied to a dominant culture for other reasons.  Perhaps there are tests of the process of spreading which would allow one to distinguish these cases.  I am not sure. {.me}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter - He brings out three of the common arguments for God: "why is there something rather than nothing?", "the wonder of design in the universe", and our "moral perceptions".  {.theist}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"why is there something rather than nothing?" - I see two answers to this.  I am not convinced that the philosophical idea of &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; is defined or can exist, without running into serious linguistic and conceptual problems.  Laurence Krauss has a very nice lecture on a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjaGktVQdNg"&gt;Universe From Nothing&lt;/a&gt;.  Essentially it boils down to, as long as the total energy of the universe is zero, it could have come from nothing without violating any laws of physics.  This is an empirical claim which is in fact &lt;a href="http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/uni_shape.html"&gt;confirmed by experiment&lt;/a&gt;.  {.me}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"the wonder of design in the universe" - if you go back 150 years, then you'd argue from the design in biology.  However Darwin demonstrated that an unguided process can give rise to highly complex structure in biology.  Now the only claims of design are in what is called the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine-tuned_Universe"&gt;Fine Tuning of the Universe&lt;/a&gt;, and is contentious amongst physicists.  If the only design that you're going to hang God's hat on is the latest arguments on the fringe of physics, then you're really not stating that design is particularly obvious, except for those who don't understand science.{.me}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"moral perceptions" - the argument from our moral code, I believe, is undermined by the fact that moral behavior is observed in other animals.  Further, if we take a biblical view, the genocidal actions of God in the Old Testament, the concept of the Atonement which forms the basis for Christianity, and the doctrine of Hell can all be seen as highly immoral and require a lot of bending over backwards to handle.  I think these lead to insurmountable challenges to this argument. {.me}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter - The Christian story confirms the moral message in the Bible, and people immediately connect to it.  God is a moral God, good always outweighs evil, and this message is not simply tacked onto the story. {.theist}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John - You don't tell the whole story, much of which is ugly.  Babies being deliberately smashed on the rocks, the atonement, hell, etc... do not match the story you're describing. {.atheist}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter - &lt;em class="tq"&gt;"One of the remarkable things about Christianity is that you don't need a PhD to become a Christian.  The essential truths can be grasped by a very simple person indeed."&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;em class="tq"&gt;"Jesus somehow takes our moral responsibility on himself so that we can go free.  It's liberating to people."&lt;/em&gt;}    {.theist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John - &lt;em class="aq"&gt;"The God revealed in the Bible is stupid.  There is no reason for him to die on the cross for anyones' sins, there's just none.  It's part of an ancient superstitious culture of sacrificial systems."&lt;/em&gt;}  It makes Satan out to be stupid too - why would be rebel against God, knowing he's omnipotent?  How is Jesus could Jesus be God and man? These things are just not defined.  {.atheist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would add, "how is &lt;a href="https://brianblais.wordpress.com/2013/11/19/the-trinity-and-coherency/"&gt;the Trinity&lt;/a&gt; a coherent concept?"  Look at a previous post of mine on &lt;a href="https://brianblais.wordpress.com/2013/11/19/the-trinity-and-coherency/"&gt;the Trinity&lt;/a&gt; where I explore the incoherence.  Peter never deals directly with this, except to merely assert that these things are coherent, but without any demonstration of that.  {.me}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter - &lt;em&gt;"they find grounds to understand that their sins are forgiven, and before God not-guilty, whether you're Stalin or Hitler (not suggesting any of those threw themselves on Christ for mercy."&lt;/em&gt; {.tq} {.theist}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of those facets of Christianity that I have a real problem with.  They claim that good outweighs evil, that justice is accomplished in the end, yet you can have someone do terrible things and essentially play the "I found Christ, Get Out of Jail Free" card right at the end and they are saved.  The person who devotes their life to good works, helping people, reducing suffering yet isn't convinced by the paltry evidence for God around is not saved.  This, to me, is not justice.  Further, I would say that it is not ethical to punish or reward someone for an &lt;em&gt;infinite&lt;/em&gt; time for actions done during a &lt;em&gt;finite&lt;/em&gt; life.{.me}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John - Those that believe in divine grace for the people who have never heard the word of God should never want to spread the word of God to others, because the result of that preaching would then implies that the target person's conscience is no longer taken into account, and the simple act of not believing the message condemns them. {.atheist}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John - &lt;em class="aq"&gt;"The &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2007/03/outsider-test-for-faith.html"&gt;Outsider Test of Faith&lt;/a&gt; is merely a test to judge all positive claims equally, and I do apply it to my atheism.  I am first and foremost an agnostic who has decided that if there is a God I'm going to proclaim myself an atheist in protest of the lack of evidence and lack of care in this world."&lt;/em&gt;} {.atheist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2007/03/outsider-test-for-faith.html"&gt;Outsider Test of Faith&lt;/a&gt;, named by John Loftus, is the following:{.me}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Test your beliefs as if you were an outsider to the faith you are evaluating. If your faith stands up under muster, then you can have your faith. If not, abandon it, for any God who requires you to believe correctly when we have this extremely strong tendency to believe what we were born into, surely should make the correct faith pass the outsider test. If your faith cannot do this, then the God of your faith is not worthy of being worshipped.{.aq} {.atheist}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The test relies on the fact that people tend to believe the things that they were raised with.  In addition, we often have a selection bias, which is that we accept those facts that fit our current beliefs and ignore or discount those that run counter to our current beliefs.  This is one of the reasons we have controlled studies in science, and peer review, and the demand for replicability in science.  We have to make a process to artificially overcome these biases because the biases keep us from finding the truth.  I tell my students to try to be &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; skeptical of claims that support what they already believe, to try to compensate a little bit for the selection bias.{.me}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter - &lt;em class="tq"&gt;"I noticed in your website you say there is a lot of doubt for any supposed historical event.  Now this seems to be an extraordinary degree of skepticism because everything we know is historic, even last week's program."&lt;/em&gt;}{.theist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think that this is hyper-skepticism because it depends on the prior probability for the claim.  Did Socrates exist?  Perhaps.  Did Hitler exist?  Almost certainly.  Did Julius Caesar exist?  Almost certainly, although somewhat less likely than Hitler.  Now you might be thinking that this is hyper-skepticism.  A non-zero probability for Hitler &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; existing?  It is possible that I'm in a Truman Show type environment, in which case every historical thing I have learned is suspect.  I don't think it is likely, but it is possible.  In fact, I think it is so unlikely that I'm willing to consider Hitler and Julius Caesar as historical facts, but I am not willing to consider Socrates or Jesus as historical facts.  But let me stress something at this point - each and every example I've used in this paragraph was for the existence of a person, something which has a decently high prior probability, and definitely does not violate any physical laws or anything like that.  The second you introduce claims like, "Person A was raised from the dead", it doesn't matter much if it was 2000 years ago or &lt;a href="http://www.saibaba.ws/miracles/raisingfromthedead.htm"&gt;40 years ago&lt;/a&gt;.  The more recent claim is more likely, but not so much that I would take it seriously.  Everything comes down to probability.{.me}&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Unbelievable Project"></category><category term="unbelievable"></category><category term="creation"></category><category term="science"></category><category term="harmonization"></category><category term="skeptic"></category></entry><entry><title>Some More Comments on Undesigned Coincidences</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2023/Nov/16/some-more-comments-on-undesigned-coincidences/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-11-16T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-11-16T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2023-11-16:/posts/2023/Nov/16/some-more-comments-on-undesigned-coincidences/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;An "undesigned coincidence" is used in an argument for the reliability of the Gospels, notable by Jonathan McLatchie, Tim McGrew and Lydia McGrew, and &lt;a href="https://jonathanmclatchie.com/yes-richard-carrier-there-are-undesigned-coincidences-part-1/"&gt;is defined as&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;An "undesigned coincidence" is used in an argument for the reliability of the Gospels, notable by Jonathan McLatchie, Tim McGrew and Lydia McGrew, and &lt;a href="https://jonathanmclatchie.com/yes-richard-carrier-there-are-undesigned-coincidences-part-1/"&gt;is defined as&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have multiple (at least two) accounts that report an event where one account answers in passing a natural question raised incidentally by the other.  Such features are &lt;em&gt;evidence&lt;/em&gt; that a real event lies behind the reports found in the gospels — that is to say, the presence of an undesigned coincidence is more probable given the hypothesis of historicism than given the annulment of that hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've written about one &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2022/Jul/11/why-undesigned-coincidences-are-not-compelling-to-me/"&gt;undesigned coincidence (UC) here&lt;/a&gt; but it has come up in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fomPHLGCpiA&amp;amp;list=WL&amp;amp;index=3&amp;amp;t=832s"&gt;discussions on YouTube&lt;/a&gt; so I felt I needed to talk about them a bit more.  Some of these UC are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the grass being green is mentioned in Mark at the time, and it's Passover time mentioned in John, and each of these is mentioned only in one Gospel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus turned to Philip to ask what is to eat when they were near Bethsaida&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How did they know the exact number of people there (i.e. 5000)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why did Jesus warn the blind man not to say anything to anyone?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list might go on, but these are the sorts of pieces of evidence that the apologists are using.  Each of these have reasonable plausible explanations in literary or oral tradition relationships.  With the green grass example why couldn't the oral tradition have had the events around passover (with or without green grass) and Mark adds green grass as a literary flourish or John drops it? It'd be like a common story around Christmas, and one author mentions Christmas and the other snow. It doesn't seem to require, or even hint at, eyewitness testimony. It's so indirect -- like all of these undesigned coincidences -- when it would have been much more straightforward for Mark to have said "My name is Mark and I was there when...."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the Philip-Bethsaida "coincidences", couldn't there have been a tradition that Philip was from Bethsaida? He could easily have been known as "Philip from Bethsaida" in the oral tradition, to keep him straight from other Philips.  If there was such a tradition, then any event that took place in Bethsaida, or was claimed to take place in or near Bethsaida, might have had Philip inserted as a primary character. This seems pretty natural, and wouldn't require any eyewitnesses, or the truth of any of those events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example -- counting the 5000. What if the number has nothing to do with the count, and is a reference to the Old Testament, like 2 Chronicles or Joshua where they refer to "5000 from the flocks" or "5000 men"? or perhaps because it's a nice round number (like the 500 eyewitnesses in Paul) and could have been chosen for that reason. I see no strong reason to think this number was an actual count, so this "undesigned coincidence" doesn't seem to be a coincidence at all, but (like many of these, I suspect) may be due to overactive pattern seeking.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, we're told, this is a cumulative case -- explaining one is ok, but having to have separate explanations for all of them, the apologists claim, strains credulity.  However, we have the following problems.  Now, this is like the third "undesigned coincidence" that I've looked at, and come up with a plausible reason for it in about 5 seconds of thinking. What does that do to the probability I'd assign to the next three I look at? Especially given 1) how trivial finding plausible alternatives is and 2) the entire mode of argument would be made moot if the Gospels followed the standards of ancient history and cited their sources, were clear about their authorship, and gave some specifics about the events.  One can find some cases of ancient historians not doing this, but it seems to be incredibly uncommon and frowned upon even in ancient times.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't have time nor the expertise to go through each and every one of the so-called "coincidences", but they all strike me initially as being completely -- and trivially -- understood as being produced by a common process and are not strong evidence that the events actually happened.  Even in theory, I don't see how one can use these UC to rule out literary or oral tradition sources for them when they exist at all.  This entire approach seems to me to be a combination of cherry picking and seeing patterns in random data, both of which are common cognitive fallacies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="what-if-im-wrong"&gt;What if I'm wrong?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so what if I'm wrong, and 1) UC actually exist in the Gospels and 2) one can use UC to establish eyewitness reporting?   This isn't an issue, because I could easily be convinced.  What apologists are proposing is that,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UC are well-defined&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can observe them in ancient texts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Their existence is strong evidence of eye-witness testimony&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I am proposing is,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UC are not well-defined as a category, but may be argued individually&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We might be able to see some UC in the Gospels and other ancient texts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In addition to the apologists claim of possible eyewitness testimony, UC can also be explained with mostly mundane explanations, including (but not limited to):&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;literary dependence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;oral tradition dependence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;actual coincidence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;legendary development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;overactive pattern finding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;multiple ways the "coincidence" could occur&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One should be able to easily make a test to distinguish between these two possibilities.  One should be able to establish, perhaps with modern texts, perhaps with ancient texts, that &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one can define UC in such a way that they can be unambiguously identified in any text&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use UC to unambiguously distinguish between fictional and non-fictional sources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use UC to unambiguously distinguish between eyewitness accounts and those accounts which rely only on 2nd, 3rd, 4th-hand accounts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that a search for the topic of undesigned coincidences only comes up with Christian apologetics sources points to the fact that this study has not been done, and I see no indication in the apologetics literature that Christians think this is a worthwhile endeavor.  It's like the faith-healing literature -- they don't want to do the hard work of actually establishing that their method does the job they claim it does, and would rather just stick with their claims and think that the skeptics are being unreasonable.  This is not how any scientist thinks, and I await the study I describe to be done.  In the meantime, I feel completely comfortable not taking undesigned coincidences seriously, because Christian apologists are clearly not taking it seriously either. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="religion"></category></entry><entry><title>Can Science Explain Everything?</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2023/Nov/15/can-science-explain-everything/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-11-15T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-11-15T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2023-11-15:/posts/2023/Nov/15/can-science-explain-everything/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Can science explain everything?

&lt;li class="theist"&gt;John Lennox  - Christian&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="atheist"&gt;Peter Atkins - Atheist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="me"&gt;Comments by myself, bblais&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;My short answer is yes (sort of).  Along the way we see John playing a little loosely with the language, using equivocation fallacies, making distinctions where none exist, and being credulous in the face of ancient history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class="theist"&gt;John - We all have faith. Atheists have faith. We all have our beliefs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;Here John is seemingly equating the word "believe" with "faith" even though I’m sure he knows they are different in some important ways. It really doesn’t matter that different people have different beliefs in this discussion. What matters is how we &lt;em&gt;justify&lt;/em&gt; those points and the process of science is the only way we know of to verify claims in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;As for whether science can explain everything I would say "I don’t know". There may be limits but we haven’t yet seen those limits. There have been people in the past who have said that certain things were impossible to measure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the subject of stars, all investigations which are not ultimately reducible to simple visual observations are ... necessarily denied to us. While we can conceive of the possibility of determining their shapes, their sizes, and their motions, we shall never be able by any means to study their chemical composition or their mineralogical structure ... Our knowledge concerning their gaseous envelopes is necessarily limited to their existence, size ... and refractive power, we shall not at all be able to determine their chemical composition or even their density... I regard any notion concerning the true mean temperature of the various stars as forever denied to us. - &lt;a href="http://www.faculty.virginia.edu/rwoclass/astr1210/comte.html"&gt;August Compte, 1835, &lt;em&gt;Cours de la Philosophie Positive&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In "LENS-LIKE ACTION OF A STAR BY THE DEVIATION OF LIGHT IN THE GRAVITATIONAL FIELD", "There is no hope of observing this phenomenon directly" - &lt;a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/84/2188/506"&gt;Einstein, 1936, &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;As a result of many such examples, I would be reticent to say that it is &lt;em&gt;impossible&lt;/em&gt; for science to explain everything. Once you say it is impossible or you give "magic" as an explanation then all explanation stops - you have a self-imposed limit. This happened to Isaac Newton when trying to describe the stability of the solar system -- &lt;a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Stability_of_the_solar_system#Introduction"&gt;Newton resorted to "God did it"&lt;/a&gt;.  The actual solution &lt;a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Stability_of_the_solar_system#Laplace-Lagrange_stability_of_the_Solar_System"&gt;took until Laplace&lt;/a&gt; to be found - even though there was nothing in this solution beyond the abilities of Newton. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;I like Peter‘s response about the public nature of the discoveries of science:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class="aq"&gt;Knowledge that can be shared. Evidence that can be shared publicly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class="aq"&gt;Peter says that scientific ideas sit in a network in relation to each other with hierarchical levels of complexity, e.g. biology, chemistry, and physics. Where they overlap they are mutually supportive which is good evidence that they are true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="aq"&gt;Peter also distinguishes between two types of questions what he calls "stupid" questions and "real" questions. Stupid questions are questions for which there is no evidence and science can dismiss immediately. Examples include &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class="aq"&gt;what is the purpose of the universe?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="aq"&gt;what is the nature of the afterlife?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class="aq"&gt;Real questions can include things like "why is there something rather than nothing" because there is evidence of something.  "What is the nature of consciousness?" because there is evidence of consciousness. These are questions that science can answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;I'd probably phrase it that science deals with &lt;em&gt;well-defined problems&lt;/em&gt;, without hidden agendas in the questions themselves.  The question "what is the nature of the afterlife?" may have a hidden agenda - assuming there is an "after" to "life" - and so is either not well-defined or requires the answer to the question of the nature of life and consciousness first.  The same goes for the "purpose" of the universe - one has to establish that there could even be such a thing, that the words actually mean what we think they mean when applied to objects like entire universes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;John likes to make a distinction between the natural sciences and the historical sciences but I don’t see why that distinction should exist. The distinction is just a matter of the type of data and the level of uncertainty but the reasoning processes are the same. Both the natural sciences and the historical sciences use the methods of prediction, applied probability theory, and falsification.  John further said that his Christianity is "evidence-based" yet he seems to believe that the Christian claims and explanations are not addressable by science.  In a way he has to do this, even though it is equivocating on the notion of "evidence".  He can't admit that his belief is not based on evidence, but it is clear that his claims are not supported by science.  Rather than admit that his beliefs are unjustified, John needs to distance himself from science on these issues.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;Perhaps another way to think of this, and to demonstrate the problem with John's thinking, is to go back to Peter’s idea of a network of ideas.  Claims about the resurrection are based on historical evidence but where that evidence overlaps with the physical sciences and biological sciences (not to mention anthropology and archaeology) you find that it leads to contradictions and not mutual support.  In order to be justified, the different levels of explanation cannot be in conflict with each other and must support each other.  Bringing in John's analogy (described below), there is nothing conflicting between saying that water boils due to heat and the water in the kettle is boiling because I wanted tea.  However, there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; something conflicting between saying that entropy increases in a closed system and a body is resurrected after 3 days.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class="theist"&gt;John thinks that science cannot answer questions such as "Where do I come from?", "Where am I going?", and "What is the meaning of life?" and he says that we have to go to religion and philosophy to answer them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;I’ve written before (&lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Jan/21/philosophy-and-science-whats-the-difference/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2017/Mar/03/philosophy-of-science-and-the-burden-of-proof/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2016/Jan/11/philosophy-and-science/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) about the value (or lack thereof) of philosophical answers to things. Since science has a method for distinguishing true from false claims we can both trust it and know &lt;em&gt;how far&lt;/em&gt; we can trust it.  Religion doesn’t have that - it has no methodology for us to distinguish true or false claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;As for the question "where do we come from?" I think science has given a far better story than any religion. Sure, you can always push the time back to before our understanding of it but if you think about the religious answers to these questions they’re all really parochial. The Bible speaks of one world. It never speaks about multiple worlds or universes. It gives no indication about the time-scales that life developed or that the universe developed, or even that the planets developed. &lt;em&gt;Everything&lt;/em&gt; that we are confident in we have learned from science and not from religion. What about the question "Where we going?" Again science points in the only directions that make sense. Knowing that processes like life, flames, and other dynamical systems will come to an end at some point eliminates most simplistic ideas of an afterlife.  Carolyn Porco &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUpM30B1vJg&amp;amp;list=PL64B250DFF80E579D"&gt;does a great job describing the story that is science&lt;/a&gt;, including musing on what happens when we die.  In contrast the religious story I find to be fanciful and unsupported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;Continuing on with John's confidence in his beliefs, if the best piece of evidence for Christianity is the resurrection then that is pretty weak. The only evidence we have for the resurrection comes from texts written &lt;em&gt;decades&lt;/em&gt; afterward from &lt;em&gt;unknown&lt;/em&gt; authors. Contrast that with anything else we have even a modest degree of confidence in.  Every time I look for the best evidence for nearly &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; else I always find evidence far better than that being claimed for the resurrection.  &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2011/Nov/29/best-evidence-for/"&gt;Try it yourself some time!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;John spends some time on the notion of explanations: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class="theist"&gt;Even when we say science explains, often it doesn't explain comprehensively.  How would you explain boiling water?  You could explain it through heat conduction and agitation of molecules of water.  You can also say that the water is boiling because I'd like a cup of tea.  Now those two explanations are very different, they don't conflict - they complement.  One is the natural scientific explanation and the other is an explanation  in terms of the intention and purposes of an agent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;The problem I think here is with the question - English is a language poorly suited to clarity. For example, there is the question of "why does water &lt;em&gt;in general&lt;/em&gt; boil?" and the question of "why &lt;em&gt;is this particular pot of water&lt;/em&gt; boiling at this moment?" I think what John is trying to get at is the idea that you can explain things on many different levels of detail.  But John is also talking about the role of agency in scientific explanations. Can scientific explanations include agency?  Of course they can -- just look at fields like archaeology or anthropology or even in biology.   If you’re looking at the development of tools or maybe even the building of dams by beavers, we can ask how they were made physically, what purpose they serve from an evolutionary point of view, how the structure of the tool or dam is related to the physical structure of the agent, etc...  However, it is up to the person claiming that an agent exists to give the evidence for its in the first place.   One also has to be clear about &lt;em&gt;which&lt;/em&gt; question one is trying to address. "How would you explain boiling water?" is an underspecified question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;John claims that God can interject arbitrary events into the universe and yet John doesn’t call this a violation of natural law.  He seems to think that it goes &lt;em&gt;beyond&lt;/em&gt; natural law.  Of course you can make the claim that there is an agent that is somehow able to interject things that &lt;em&gt;appear&lt;/em&gt; on the face of it to be contradictions in natural law but it is still an unconvincing claim unless you can demonstrate that the agent actually exists!  We have many people in the past who have claimed violations of natural law (e.g. perpetual motion machines) but these claims have no actual evidential support - not a single one.  It's gotten so bad that the US patent office - which doesn't require a patent idea to even work - refuses to even &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; at such claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;So, if you are going to say (for whatever process) that you have evidence for the violation of the second law of thermodynamics (e.g a perpetual motion machine or a resurrection) then you need to have evidence that would be strong enough to convince physicists.  Historical evidence can &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; rise to this level.  There have been many claims in the past that have suggested a violation of the known physical laws at the time - (e.g. cold fusion, faster than light travel, etc...) - yet even these had evidence far stronger than simply historical evidence.  Scientists are open to such possibilities but the bar has to be set high because most claims are simply false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;I would add further that I don't really care whether God did it or aliens or some other mechanism until I am presented with enough evidence to see if there is even anything of interest to look at.  It is premature to talk about how aliens might have gotten to Earth or what they look like until there is at least some credible evidence that UFOs are alien spacecraft or that alien technology is verified.   With the resurrection, there isn't enough evidence to even be confident there is an effect to be studied, let alone to pin down a mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;I often wonder why Christians are convinced by this sort of evidence.   When I have brought up the common knowledge that the  documents are written many years after the event, that it’s questionable whether we have &lt;em&gt;any understanding&lt;/em&gt; of their authorship, and that we have no idea whether they were even eyewitnesses or at least have access to eye witnesses the common responses I've gotten are that this is common in all of ancient history or that you shouldn’t expect historical documents to be like scientific documents.  I agree with that!  But that should make one &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; confident in the conclusions not more confident.  We should require the levels of￼ evidence that would convince us &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt;.  I don’t really care if that's impossible with ancient documents - that's on God, as far as I can tell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;Concerning natural law, I find it interesting that John says the resurrection is not a violation of natural law because the lawmaker is doing it.  Here, I think we have a problem with wording.  What we call "natural law" is the observed regularity of nature. Perhaps we find that certain regularities are never observed to be violated under every possible measurement that we have ever made.  Even there we could be wrong.  For example, when scientists were first talking about quantum mechanics or relativity they found that there were regularities which were never violated in &lt;em&gt;everyday&lt;/em&gt; life but are violated under certain circumstances (e.g. very small or very fast).  Of course, those circumstances were experimentally determined multiple times such that we could - like Hume - say that it would be more likely that the law we thought originally was correct needed adjusting rather than these new experiments were all (consistently) in error.  For a resurrection, I would expect nothing less.  The probability of a resurrection happening via natural causes is of course astronomical.  Even if one grants unknown causes, the probability is still astronomical until you can demonstrate that the unknown cause is so likely as to overturn the astronomically small probabilities of the claimed event.  Again, historical evidence or philosophical arguments just don't ever rise to this level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="theist"&gt;John reads the book of Genesis where Adam is commanded to name the animals and states that this is the beginnings of the science of taxonomy.  Further, he states that in the beginning there was the Word, and DNA is also a language, so the explanations are again complementary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;This to me is reading into the text what you want to see.  An easy way to see this is to ask the question the other way - were the early biblical writers able to take their text and use it as a guide to find explanations for things like DNA and evolution and cosmology?  Since all of these concepts took hundreds to thousands of years to develop, with no clear advantage given by the content of the Bible, this seems to me good evidence for post-hoc rationalization.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="theist"&gt;John asks his atheist friends whether they would trust a computer if it was "the result of a mindless unguided process" and he always got the answer "No".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;I would give the answer "maybe" -- it would depend on how the process was set up. It could very easily be that you could set up an evolutionary framework that would result in a computational structure that would be able to solve problems in its environment.   I see no reason why that couldn’t happen now, even if it’s a little hard to do with silicon just because of the physics.  I think John feels that "unguided" must in some way be related to "random" and thus untrustworthy.  As an analogy to see the difference, if I place a marble on the edge of a bowl - anywhere on the edge - it will eventually (unguided by agency) make it to the bottom of the bowl in the same spot.  Following the laws of nature does not lead to randomness and chaos and could (given a complex enough system) lead to trustworthy computational structures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;John talks several times about the "atheist worldview". This is clearly something he should have learned by now: atheism isn't a worldview. You could talk about a naturalistic worldview but you can’t talk about an atheist worldview.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="tq"&gt;According to John, he wants to have a worldview that is big enough to live for and to live in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;This strikes me as an &lt;em&gt;emotional&lt;/em&gt; response, perhaps the need to feel more important, to feel tied to something bigger than he is and something that is not mindless.  I typically follow the advice that if you ascribe &lt;em&gt;psychological&lt;/em&gt; reasons for someone else's beliefs while ascribing &lt;em&gt;logical&lt;/em&gt; reasons for your own then you’ve lost the argument. Here John seems to be admitting it explicitly so I don't have a problem drawing it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="me"&gt;To sum up, across the entire debate it is clear that John is credulous about the ancient documents, misuses terminology, and shows sloppy thinking and speaking.  He leans on anecdotal evidence, selectively chooses those parts of the data that support his religious views and doesn't seem to see the proper use of scientific and rational thinking to address claims.  Some of these are so astonishing (like his seeming confidence in conversion stories) that it is hard to imagine how he could think this way and be taken seriously.  Although a pleasant debater, I have never been swayed by any of John Lennox's arguments.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Unbelievable Project"></category><category term="unbelievable"></category></entry><entry><title>How NaNoWriMo Got Me Back to the Gym</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2023/Nov/14/how-nanowrimo-got-me-back-to-the-gym/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-11-14T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-11-14T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2023-11-14:/posts/2023/Nov/14/how-nanowrimo-got-me-back-to-the-gym/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So National Novel Writing Month (&lt;a href="http://nanowrimo.org"&gt;NaNoWriMo&lt;/a&gt;) is here, and it has its usual ups and downs as expected.

For this event, you commit to writing 50,000 words of a new novel during the month of November.  I first did it in 2019 - "won" it, achieving the 50,000 words of an admittedly terrible novel.  2020 was, well, 2020 as we all know.  2021 I rewrote the original one, by hand,  which improved it quite a bit, and then over the course of a year transcribed it.  I found that handwriting it had some definite benefits.  I felt that I could turn off my internal editor more effectively, I was less likely to get distracted because I was away from the technology, I could squeeze in writing during times that would be awkward or impossible to use a computer (e.g. watching a concert on TV with the family, waiting in the car to pick someone up, etc...), and I think there is some non-tangible benefit to the physical process of handwriting that I can't put my finger on.  The next year, 2022, I decided I didn't have the time and then this year I roped a few others into doing it to help me stay motivated.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far this month I have been doing well, keeping to 1700 words a day (9 handwritten pages of 190 words).  Saturday I had a demotivation point where I was frustrated with the way the story was going, wondering if I was wasting my time doing this at all when I have other work I should be doing.  Perhaps this was just a procrastination technique of mine to work on something other than the things that were pressing.  Also, I felt that while I enjoy a good story, I find it very difficult to come up with good ones myself.  I can't visualize things as clearly as I've heard others can, I find that my resolutions tent to be simplistic yet I don't know the best way to handle this.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, I do like imagining other worlds, other characters.  I like the exploration of these new places and people, but I know I can't do everything I'd like to do in life -- I have to choose, so what to choose?  The good thing about &lt;a href="http://nanowrimo.org"&gt;NaNoWriMo&lt;/a&gt; is the commitment to write, to look to produce volume rather than focus on quality.  It is this permission to write something bad that is motivating -- and gives the raw material to improve afterward.  It is the experimenting, and playing with words, that might get one to be better.  It is the act of showing up each day to do something challenging, but not overwhelming, where the cumulative effect across a month is something substantial that has value.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, when I was demotivated, I wrote about writing itself, about the frustrations.  I wrote about how parts of the story weren't working and what might fix them or at least make them a little less bad.  It was my internal editor, but I felt I needed to voice it because the problems in the story were building and making it worse.  I then outlined the entire plot, so perhaps I could work on parts of it out of order.  I gave myself permission to write about other things, to be what is called a &lt;a href="http://nanowrimo.org"&gt;NaNoWriMo&lt;/a&gt; Rebel -- someone who writes 50,000 words in a month, but not all on the novel, or even at all on the novel, but progresses their writing farther.  I gave myself the permission to write short stories -- perhaps poking at different ideas would help give me the confidence again.  Perhaps exploring a small, focused story would help me work on specific things like description or dialog without getting bogged down in world building or long plot lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started &lt;a href="http://nanowrimo.org"&gt;NaNoWriMo&lt;/a&gt;, I started getting the virtual badges from the site -- first post, first 5k words, 3 day streak, etc...  I had won all these badges before, except one -- to post 1667 words every day, so i had my sights set on that.  I wasn't focused on the total, I was focused on the &lt;em&gt;habit&lt;/em&gt;.  When I look at building a habit like this, I recall books on productivity that have been of help to me in the past.  &lt;a href="https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Atomic Habits&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by James Clear and &lt;a href="https://bulletjournal.com/pages/book"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bullet Journal Method&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Ryder Carroll are two such books, so I reread both of those over the past couple of weeks.   I'm a slow reader, but I accomplished this by listening to audiobooks while working in the yard, or driving here and there.  These books get me thinking about &lt;em&gt;systems&lt;/em&gt; as opposed to &lt;em&gt;goals&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;a href="http://nanowrimo.org"&gt;NaNoWriMo&lt;/a&gt; forces one to face both.  The goal of 50,000 words is there, but because it is so daunting, requiring a sustained regular effort across the month one has to examine ones systems for accomplishing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite my previous &lt;a href="http://nanowrimo.org"&gt;NaNoWriMo&lt;/a&gt; accomplishments, I feel that it hasn't been an entire success for me.  Sure, I finished a draft of a novel that I am reasonably proud of (which took 3 years) but my writing habit didn't sustain past November each time.  I could buckle down, get something that has value pretty much only to me (a novel that is pretty basic at best) but there isn't lasting value I think to others, and perhaps not even to me.  Or at least not as much value as I'd like to see.  In a way, I think it probably worth more to post 1700 words daily on this blog for a month, exploring various random topics.  That would be something of value I think.  Perhaps I should write a new paper to submit to a journal (or maybe get a couple papers out the door that have been languishing due to me not having a good system in place).   I like fiction, but find it hard to get into a new fiction series or book.  I read much more nonfiction, listen to many more podcasts and seminars, and re-read or listen to fiction I'm comfortable with (e.g. Lord of the Rings, Dune, Babylon 5, Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, etc...) rather than starting something new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I do appreciate the fact that there is a common motivation this month to accomplish something big.  When I was looking at my habits, I noticed that I had stopped exercising and have been gaining weight or at least gaining a more spherical shape for the same weight.  In my exploration of habits, I was motivated by YouTuber &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JamesDunne"&gt;James Dunne&lt;/a&gt; to look into how to work some &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/bLdrCTponaE?si=IxNf7-hM94ASMbvM"&gt;strength into my routines&lt;/a&gt;, but keeping it simple.  I was looking at various exercise routings, and came across the &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/nnf1YyMB39g?si=3nRVrMhIkEff7XjD"&gt;The Only Five Exercises You Need&lt;/a&gt; video, and there was a phrase in the comments to the video: "Stay fit, age is not the barrier. Attitude is. Overcome it"  At about the same time,  I was talking to my friend who exercises a lot (much more than I have time for) and I asked him about his routine.  He said that he gets up early, around 4:45am, and goes for a run -- minimum 5 miles -- and then in the afternoon he goes to the gym for weights.  The magnitude was more than I would want, or be able, to do given my other commitments but it was the other things that he said that really struck me.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He runs regardless of the weather.  That way there is no question about whether he will run on a given day.  He said the hardest thing is getting out of bed in the morning, and pulling on the running clothes.  But he just does it.  I asked what happens if he starts thinking "Oh, I just want to sleep in today." and he replied that he doesn't allow that.  He also said that he runs not for the physical benefits but for the mental benefits -- to clear his head.  Finally, he said, that once he has done the hardest thing in the day -- waking up, and running in 23 degree weather, that the rest of the day doesn't seem that hard.  That was the final pin that got pulled for me.  I was looking at habits due to &lt;a href="http://nanowrimo.org"&gt;NaNoWriMo&lt;/a&gt;, looking to accomplish something great, and it had brought me to the realization of how to revamp my exercise.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past three days -- and I hope for the foreseeable future -- I have gotten up early, around 5am, 20 minutes of strength (from the &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/nnf1YyMB39g?si=3nRVrMhIkEff7XjD"&gt;The Only Five Exercises You Need&lt;/a&gt; video, mostly, but also some from James Dunne's video &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/bLdrCTponaE?si=ts3nsQxOgwMsrr06"&gt;12 Minute Strength Workout for Runners (INJURY PREVENTION)&lt;/a&gt;), then 20 minutes of running outside.  No treadmill allowed, no excuses.  I'm sore, but not injured -- which I hope the strength exercises will help me keep the injuries away.  &lt;a href="http://nanowrimo.org"&gt;NaNoWriMo&lt;/a&gt; teaches us that a concerted effort every day can accomplish large effects over time.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also learned that I need to be honest with myself, and there is more value in some things than others.  I wrote 0 words yesterday, so I won't be getting the "1667 words every day badge".  But I am fine with that.  I had a day where I ran 2 miles in 23 degree weather before anyone was awake, taught 4 classes, had 3 meetings, and gave a research talk.  At the end of the day, I had a choice of either working on NaNo to get that badge or to go out with my friends to relax.  I chose my friends.    There are some things more important, and one can't do everything that one wants to do.  There are too many interesting things in this life, and one has to choose between them.  That is not a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://nanowrimo.org"&gt;NaNoWriMo&lt;/a&gt; forces one to face priorities and systems, while it teaches us valuable lessons about the power of consistent work toward a goal.  I've decided to be a &lt;a href="http://nanowrimo.org"&gt;NaNoWriMo&lt;/a&gt; Rebel this year, doing the 50,000 words for the month, but not necessarily on the novel itself.  In fact, probably not mostly on the novel.  This post is my 1700 words for today.  Have a great day!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="productivity"></category><category term="productivity"></category><category term="writing"></category></entry><entry><title>What Does Probability have to do with God?</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2023/Oct/18/what-does-probability-have-to-do-with-god/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-10-18T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-10-18T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2023-10-18:/posts/2023/Oct/18/what-does-probability-have-to-do-with-god/</id><summary type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will present a framework for rational inquiry based on probability theory. Probability theory is a branch of mathematics that deals with uncertainty and how to reason about it. I will explain the basic concepts and principles of probability, and how they can be applied to any domain of interest, including theology, the study of the nature of God and religious beliefs. I will explore some of the key theological concepts, such as belief, faith, miracles, and the existence of God, and how they can be analyzed using probability. I will also compare and contrast the scientific method with other ways of acquiring knowledge, such as revelation and intuition. My aim is to provide a clear and consistent way of thinking about these topics, and to reveal the hidden assumptions and implications of various theological arguments. Along the way, I will demonstrate some surprising and counterintuitive results that arise from probability theory, and how they can lead to errors in reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;

I had read the Bible …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I listened to the &lt;a href="https://media.ascensionpress.com/category/ascension-podcasts/bibleinayear/"&gt;Bible in a Year podcast with Fr. Mike Schmitz&lt;/a&gt; where Fr. Mike Schmitz reads the entire bible across 365 days.  I had read the Bible before, many years ago, but having it in audio format had a few advantages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you can "read" the Bible while doing other things -- mowing the lawn, driving, etc...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you don't skip through the long lists of names and the repetition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you hear explanations of the readings, especially reminders of difficult person- or place-names or when the story repeats from a previous chapter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the way I took random notes and cross-checked some things with other sources and I am collecting these notes here for anyone interested.  I didn't write about every single day (frankly, some of my responses got repetitive) but I did write across the entire year.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://bnspcatholic.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/the-official-365-day-reading-plan-for-the-bible-in-a-year.pdf"&gt;full schedule of the podcast can be downloaded here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where I refer to "commentary" or to "Fr. Mike Schmitz" I'm referring to the analysis after each reading.  The format of each day is a short intro (mostly the same), the reading, and then a commentary.   Here's the TLDR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I really do appreciate Fr. Mike Schmitz's earnestness and his sense of humor. Even though I don’t agree with nearly anything he says, in terms of content, I do thank him for the amount of time and effort that he put into this and his honest communication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is nothing in the Bible that even suggests that the person writing this knew more than me or anyone else in history, let alone an omniscient being.  If someone could point to anything in this book that indicates omniscient input, I'd love to hear it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don’t think I will ever do this again. It’s an incredible amount of time even with the advantage of the podcast.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am unclear about the lessons in the Bible -- there is an incredible amount of barbarism which, in any other book, I would have stopped reading.  Even the lessons of Jesus are suspect, and the repetition is incredibly inefficient.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As one reads the notes below, there is a lot of justification given for things that are clearly terrible.   Again, if any other book said these things there is no way a moral person like Fr. Mike Schmitz would put forward such justifications and rationalizations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-1-genesis-12-psalm-19"&gt;Day 1  - Genesis 1–2 Psalm 19&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is nothing in the creation narratives that even suggests that the person writing this knew more than me, let alone being omniscient.  there is no hint of other planets, of heliocentrism, of galaxies -- even though that would have been trivial for a god to communicate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The entire story sounds like Aesop's fables, or other ancient creation myths.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The commentary said that this creation account is unique in the ancient world because the world was not created out of fighting or sexual interaction.  this is just not true, as the Genesis story is a slight change from some of the Babylonian creation accounts (the Ionians had stories just like this).  what makes it Jewish is that it reinforced the 7-day week, so that Jews in exile would still keep the Sabbath.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-2-genesis-34-psalm-104"&gt;Day 2 - Genesis 3–4 Psalm 104&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who was the honest one and who was dishonest in the story of Adam and Eve?  It's clear that the snake (which is nowhere stated to be either Satan or Lucifer) is honest whereas Yahweh is not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apparently the use of the word "snake" here is related to Tiamat or Levaiathan -- the great sea creature, also known as the agent of chaos.  The ancient creation myths often have god (or gods) of order fighting chaos.  Even in genesis, it is God who lays out the order over the waters (not ex nihilo).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was reading this, I also listened to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy_2FMlTSHI&amp;amp;list=PL4P20nug29iy5BsrXBlpK3YMcbUKYQnV0"&gt;Robert M Price's 9-part Genesis Study&lt;/a&gt;, where I got most of what I know about the ancient creation myths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-3-genesis-56-psalm-136"&gt;Day 3 - Genesis 5–6 Psalm 136&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hearing the genealogies and the start of the Noah story, I wonder where all the people came from since it started with two (Adam and Eve) and both Cain and Seth came from Eve, so where did their wives come from?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also, wouldn't god know that the flood wouldn't solve his problems?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-4-genesis-79-psalm-1"&gt;Day 4 - Genesis 7–9 Psalm 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Of course there's all the ridiculousness of the flood, making it clearly a myth, but I want to focus on another piece. There's a point where it says when one sheds man's blood that one's blood will be shed by man.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%209%3A6&amp;amp;version=ESV"&gt;Genesis 9:6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Whoever sheds the &lt;strong&gt;blood&lt;/strong&gt; of man, by man shall his &lt;strong&gt;blood&lt;/strong&gt; be shed, for God made man in his own image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commentary says this is a prohibition against murder. But I think it's pretty clear that it's not a prohibition against murder, but rather an endorsement of blood revenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-5-genesis-1011-psalm-2"&gt;Day 5 - Genesis 10–11 Psalm 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So the Tower of Babel story seems to be another one of these Aesop's fables, or just so stories. God comes down to confuse them deliberately, because they are being successful, and then the spin in the commentary is all about how their success was because of lust for power, and not just for excellence. It's amazing how these commentaries paint everything in a positive light rather than a straightforward reading of the text. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's also interesting that Enoch, who lives 365 years has the same properties as the sun gods in the Assyrian and Babylonian mythologies, including being taken up to heaven, and conquering the flood. In this way, Robert M Price suggests that Enoch was probably the original hero of the flood story and the story was rewritten for Noah. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another interesting point is the mention of the "sons of God", and the "daughters of men", which are parallel to the existence of Demi-gods and huge warriors, such as Gilgamesh, and serves as the origin of evil in the world. The story comes right before the flood, and serves as a justification for the flood. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also interesting is that there are two flood stories interweaved. One version talks about 150 days and to buy two of every single animal. The other version includes clean and unclean animals, which, if the later parts of the Bible are believed, this distinction shouldn't have happened until Moses -- the kosher laws didn't exist until Moses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also, the flood story in the epic of Gilgamesh is remarkably similar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the really weird story about Noah, getting drunk and his son Ham seeing him I never noticed that Noah's response was to curse Canaan. Robert M price suspects that there is something that isn't actually said that has been omitted, and that Canaan, who is Ham's son may have done whatever terrible thing or the original story had Canaan as the fourth son. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-9-genesis-1819-job-78-proverbs-21-5"&gt;Day 9 - Genesis 18–19 Job 7–8 Proverbs 2:1-5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Got Covid so no responses for a while.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots of circumcisions.  None of this sounds like an all-knowing being writing or inspiring this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why all this animal sacrifice?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The name, Isaac, means "one who laughs". Which is a literary nod to Abraham laughing.   &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also the story with Abraham arguing with God just sounds ridiculous to me right now.  Although, there is a treatment of this scenario which explores the idea of being good without God in the Beyond Belief 2006 Conference, with &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/bq3L5Ezk_Es?t=272"&gt;Susan Neiman's presentation&lt;/a&gt;.  In this treatment, the moral reasoning of the story is explored thoughtfully, but I get the feeling that one could read this sort of thing into nearly any story.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lot gave his daughters to protect the men who came?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still this story sounds like just-so stories -- explaining why a city was destroyed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is up with the story of Lots daughters sleeping with him?  Weird!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those countries are enemies of Israel so maybe another just so story&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From Robert M Price -- apparently it was a common practice for a priest or shaman to help infertile women conceive (presumably by sleeping with her either with or without husbands permission). This is related to the many pagan stories of gods impregnating women.   My addition -- the connection to the Jesus story is pretty obvious here.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-11-genesis-2223-job-1112-proverbs-29-15"&gt;Day 11 - Genesis 22–23 Job 11–12 Proverbs 2:9-15&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So I learned from Robert M Price that there is a parallel story for the Isaac and Abraham story, coming &lt;a href="https://www.greeklegendsandmyths.com/phrixus.html"&gt;from Greece&lt;/a&gt;. In this story, there was a king (Athamas of Boeotia), with a son named &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrixus"&gt;Phrixus&lt;/a&gt;.   Apparently the son was from his first wife, but his second wife, after the first wife died, was discontent and wanted her own son with the king be the heir. So she arranged to have the priest make up a fake decree that the firstborn son had to be sacrificed. The king took the son out, and just before the blade struck he was stopped by Hercules, who said that Zeus does not want human sacrifice.  He then provided a ram as a replacement, and then the king and the son came back home.  This story either exists at the same time or earlier than the one in the Bible, it's pretty incredible that there's such a parallel story at the same time.  This means that one copied from the other or they both were part of a soup of stories, where you had common themes across many cultures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-13-genesis-2526-job-1516-proverbs-220-22"&gt;Day 13 - Genesis 25–26 Job 15–16 Proverbs 2:20-22&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Joseph story is a retelling of the Osiris-Horus story. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a side comment, there are so many times where I believe in the translation on this podcast they just say "the Lord" in different sources, where the originals used different name, e.g. Yahweh, Elohim, etc...  In the text sometimes a different font is used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Esau and Isaac are both Sun gods, and Jacob is a moon God.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many of the stories are retellings of other stories of these gods made into stories about people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-32-exodus-9-leviticus-7-psalm-49"&gt;Day 32 - Exodus 9 Leviticus 7 Psalm 49&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talking about how God hardens pharaoh's heart, and how this is not about taking away his free will came up in the commentary, which is really pretty lame. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, they say God is all good and perfect, even though the story doesn't sound like that at all like not even remotely. He's bragging about how he's showing off his power   He's being petulant and even his power seems pretty weak. I'm pretty sure I could think of other ways to demonstrate power that would not involve frogs and locusts. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But anyway back to the hardening of the heart. The analogy Mike Schmitz uses is of wax and clay in the sun. You have something like wax which softens in the heat of the sun and you have something like clay, which hardens in the heat of the sun. So when God hardens pharaoh's heart it is just that pharaohs heart has a propensity to harden in the presence of God and God is not   eliminating the free will of the pharaoh.  I'm not convinced by this analogy, but it is at least an attempt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God says "I have made sport of the Egyptians".   I'm pretty sure &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcion_of_Sinope"&gt;Marcion&lt;/a&gt; had it correct when he said that the God of the Old Testament, Yahweh, was not the same God as the God Jesus is talking about.  It's hard to imagine Jesus of the story endorsing such barbarious actions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-34-exodus-12-leviticus-9-psalm-114"&gt;Day 34 - Exodus 12 Leviticus 9 Psalm 114&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So the story here is of the Passover where God kills the firstborn of all the Egyptians. And then father Mike Schmitz says that this was 100% justice that God is 100% just. And the reason that this is "just" was because pharaoh didn't let the people go, and he was warned that this was going to happen. Doesn't matter what happened to the babies it seems! That doesn't seem like justice to me. That seems like petty retribution. Why didn't God just punish the pharaoh directly? Why does he have to punish other people? Why does he have to punish innocence? This is not justice. But those who take this document as the inspired word of God have to say that this is justice and turn off their moral compass. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-39-exodus-21-leviticus-14-psalm-75"&gt;Day 39 - Exodus 21 Leviticus 14 Psalm 75&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The commentary has the typical apologetic that the slavery at that time was more like an indentured servitude.  It is suggested that you would give your services because you're too poor.  However, Fr Schmitz doesn't seem to recognize that the Bible clearly states many times that the slaves are your property and you can hand them down as such and that the girls are your sex slaves. It ignores the totally immoral laws like if you beat your slaves and they don't die immediately and they live for a few days you will not be punished because the slave is your property. This apologetic is what you get when you blindly believe that this book has to be perfect, or has to be entirely correct and you have to bend over backwards and ignore your own morality in order to make these ridiculous arguments. Frankly, it's disgusting.   I mean ask yourself the question is it ever, in any context, justifiable to own someone as property?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fr Schmitz goes further, giving excuses for God, that the people in the stories don't really know him, and that the gods around are unfair, and God's coming from a place of justice.  This is very hard to tell from the rules God's giving. That somehow the fact that these were more barbaric peoples is an excuse for basically talking down to them. This is God, who can supposedly make entire universes. And you're saying he can't find a way to convince people who are used to slavery that, "hey, maybe owning people as property should be one of the more important of the 10 Commandments"?  He seems to be able to convince them to do all sorts of crazy animal sacrifices, and not to have blended fabrics, and this is beyond him? The excuse making is just outrageous, and repugnant, given the nature of the material in these books.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fr Schmitz does say that God has to come down to the level. The analogy is that you would not criticize a first grader for doing arithmetic while you're doing calculus. The problem is that there were other cultures at that time that actually had moral systems superior to this, so it clearly wasn't beyond these people.  It's just as an excuse that is being given for this outrageous book. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fr Schmitz literally says that the slaves are not your property in his explanation of indentured servitude. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exodus 21:20-21: 20 “Anyone who beats their male or female slave with a rod must be punished if the slave dies as a direct result, 21 but they are not to be punished if the slave recovers after a day or two, &lt;strong&gt;since the slave is their property.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's these kind of morally repugnant stances that make me want to stop listening to this podcast.  What he's doing is reading &lt;em&gt;into&lt;/em&gt; the text what he &lt;em&gt;wants it to be&lt;/em&gt; and not actually reading what it says. I would think that would be blasphemy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-40-exodus-22-leviticus-15-psalm-76"&gt;Day 40 - Exodus 22 Leviticus 15 Psalm 76&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots of male discharges. 😂🤮&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This really is the best that God can do? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-41-exodus-23-leviticus-16-psalm-77"&gt;Day 41 - Exodus 23 Leviticus 16 Psalm 77&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exodus 34:26 You shall not boil a young goat in its mother’s milk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Glad I got that one stated -- I was just about to do that! 😀&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-42-exodus-24-leviticus-1718-psalm-78"&gt;Day 42 - Exodus 24 Leviticus 17–18 Psalm 78&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's all rules about who can sleep with whom, mostly prohibition against incest. Mike Schmitz makes a point that there are some rules that are eternal (moral laws) and some rules that are specific to the Jewish people or to the temple (temple laws). So the example of mixed fabrics is something that passed away because Israel passed away. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Makes me wonder then what is the status of the 10 Commandments?  Are such laws eternal given that most do not have to do with moral questions. It also makes me wonder about the rules about stoning your daughter who is not a virgin. The social rules have to be moral rules, right? I doubt that the Bible is very specific about these things. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-48-exodus-3334-leviticus-24-psalm-80"&gt;Day 48 - Exodus 33–34 Leviticus 24 Psalm 80&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exodus 34:26 You shall not boil a young goat in its mother’s milk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A direct command by God, seemingly more important than "you should not own people as property."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-49-exodus-3536-leviticus-25-psalm-81"&gt;Day 49 - Exodus 35–36 Leviticus 25 Psalm 81&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots of putting people to death for various transgressions. It's really hard to imagine a God of peace and justice saying these things. Again I'm thinking the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcion_of_Sinope"&gt;Marcionites&lt;/a&gt; had correct.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There's a lot of Aoife (actually ephah, which is a measurement in Israel). I'm not sure what the word actually is but it's a measure of some kind of grain or liquid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And we have more stuff about slavery in this one, including a case where someone said, if your brother is poor, you can take him as a servant, but not a slave and he can work and repay things and then go back to his family. This seems to go against the idea that "slavery" refers to indentured servitude in all contexts, because this is an example where it is contrasted, almost specifically, with indentured servitude&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And the fact that the book specifies how to treat slaves from Israel versus slaves from other countries goes against the interpretation that slavery is indentured servitude&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fr Schmitz also says that the reason that things repeat is because you repeat the important things. I think we can pretty much dispense with that idea, because there are many things that repeat that are really not that important.  It seems much more reasonable that things repeat because they came from different sources that were cobbled together and in some cases they merged the stories and in other cases they just put them back to back, not wanting to get rid of any particular source.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This entire discussion about slaves is really terrible and wrong. First Fr. Schmitz is saying that this is the only way God could have done this -- by essentially endorsing slavery temporarily, possibly so that these people can grow, even though there were people in other countries who did not have slaves even at that time. Seems like he's selling God short and have a lack of imagination. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The problem with all of this is that if you assume that this book is written by the creator of the universe, who is all-just and all-good, you will have to bend your own morality into knots. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fr. Schmitz says that the Bible is good and true, but sometimes you have to read between the lines. What that means is that you read what you want to read. It's more like reading around the lines. He said that there are many churches that try to guess what God wants -- seems like this is what he's doing as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The idea that a God would &lt;em&gt;want to be worshiped&lt;/em&gt; seems perverse to me. How can any thinking being want to be worshiped?  Why would they want a creation of theirs to worship them? for me I can't imagine making something myself and then wanting to have it worship me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-56-numbers-5-deuteronomy-5-psalm-90"&gt;Day 56 - Numbers 5 Deuteronomy 5 Psalm 90&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is really interesting to hear Fr. Schmitz bending over backwards to justify the use of idols in the Catholic Church and how it’s not a violation of one of the commandments. Now I don’t really care one way or another whether it’s true, but it does show that you can twist any text to mean pretty much the opposite of what it says.  This particular case is just such a great example of that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-61-numbers-11-deuteronomy-10-psalm-33"&gt;Day 61 - Numbers 11 Deuteronomy 10 Psalm 33&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deuteronomy 10:16 - 16 Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no longer stubborn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What a great and odd phrase "foreskin of your heart"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So we get a story of a talking donkey.  Is this a book we need to take seriously?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-71-numbers-23-deuteronomy-2425-psalm-106"&gt;Day 71 - Numbers 23 Deuteronomy 24–25 Psalm 106&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There’s a quote about being put to death only for your own sin, which I think is indirect contradiction to the idea of original sin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deuteronomy 24 - 6 Fathers shall not be put to death because of their children, nor shall children be put to death because of their fathers. Each one shall be put to death for his own sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-84-joshua-1011-psalm-128"&gt;Day 84 - Joshua 10–11 Psalm 128&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fr. Schmitz discussing the sun standing still as possibly against science, and then he sites Galileo incorrectly, and says that it was more about ego versus ego, rather than about faith versus science. But then he says that Copernicus, who was also a priest had already made that observation of a heliocentric solar system, and there was no backlash against him. What Fr. Schmitz fails to realize is that Copernicus did not publish his work until after he died &lt;em&gt;because he was afraid of the backlash.&lt;/em&gt;  He knew there would be a backlash.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fr. Schmitz then refers to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle_of_the_Sun"&gt;Fatima miracle&lt;/a&gt; as being similar.  Or he says it could be allegorical.  Seems to me that if this is allegorical why not the entire story?  Also the &lt;a href="https://cdn.centerforinquiry.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/29/2009/11/22164423/p14.pdf"&gt;story of Fatima has its own issues&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-97-1-samuel-35-psalm-150"&gt;Day 97 - 1 Samuel 3–5 Psalm 150&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Samuel%203%3A1&amp;amp;version=ESV"&gt;1 Samuel 3:1&lt;/a&gt; Now the boy Samuel &lt;strong&gt;was&lt;/strong&gt; ministering to the &lt;strong&gt;Lord&lt;/strong&gt; in the presence of Eli. And the word of the &lt;strong&gt;Lord&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;was&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;rare&lt;/strong&gt; in those days; there &lt;strong&gt;was&lt;/strong&gt; no frequent vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a really interesting quote and reminds me of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Origin_of_Consciousness_in_the_Breakdown_of_the_Bicameral_Mind"&gt;Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-99-john-13-proverbs-51-6"&gt;Day 99 - John 1–3 Proverbs 5:1-6&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Gospel of John says “truly truly I say to you“ so many times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s interesting that Jesus overturned the temple in John Chapter 2 and not at the end as in the other Gospels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Gospel of John, he is constantly saying that he is the Son of the Father and the Father works through him and the Father and I are one. I don’t think this happens in Mark.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-130-2-samuel-12-1-chronicles-16-psalm-51"&gt;Day 130 - 2 Samuel 12 1 Chronicles 16 Psalm 51&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have a lovely story about David committing adultery that was in the previous day and in this day he’s punished by God. How is he punished? The baby that he was having with his current-wife was killed.  After the readings, Fr. Mike Schmitz talks about how God loves you and wants to set you back on the right path and all I could think of was "what about that baby?" Is that baby going to hell? Did God love that baby? Did that baby deserve what happened? Was David actually punished? The morality of this book is pretty atrocious. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I get about a week behind, and then I binge a number of episodes. The problem is one of motivation is because the Bible is such a painful book. There is no indication that anyone smarter than ancient goat herders wrote this thing. I can’t even tell most of the time what the message is supposed to be, or even if there is supposed to be a message. What’s the point? The interpretations seem strained at best.  It’s just so hard to spend any time on this stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-153-1-kings-11-ecclesiastes-1012-psalm-9"&gt;Day 153 - 1 Kings 11 Ecclesiastes 10–12 Psalm 9&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it seems that Yahweh likes punishing some for the sins of others.  Solomon started following other gods, so Yahweh decides to break up the kingdom -- but not while Solomon is alive, but to his son.  This all seems like someone writing to explain why a sequel kingdom failed by attributing the failure to the sins of Solomon.  I think this is a super common theme at this point in the Bible -- when things go well, they attribute it to God, when things go badly, they attribute it to the missteps of the leaders with respect to their service to god.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still, there has been absolutely nothing that &lt;em&gt;even hints&lt;/em&gt; at an omniscient writer or influencer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-161-mark-1516-psalm-22"&gt;Day 161 - Mark 15–16 Psalm 22&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fr. Schmitz says that Psalm 22 is so close to what Jesus went through that it was prophecy.  It seems so clear to me that Mark wrote the Psalm into the story.  How could you tell the difference?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This version of the Bible had the long version of Mark that I hadn’t heard.  It has the handling snakes and drinking poison parts.  Interesting that the actual Gospel ends with sending the women out and "they said nothing to anyone".   &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fr. Schmitz also says that it is an amazing sacrifice for God to have his son killed but I thing David Smalley puts it best as "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmlatsb8-VA"&gt;a bad weekend at human camp&lt;/a&gt;".  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-165-1-kings-1516-2-chronicles-1617-song-of-solomon-4"&gt;Day 165 - 1 Kings 15–16 2 Chronicles 16–17 Song of Solomon 4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There’s a point where Fr. Schmitz says that God doesn’t need these animals that are sacrificed. But it is a symbol of their trust in him, because those are the most valuable things that they sacrifice. Perhaps that's a metaphor that Jordan Peterson could make something out of. You need to sacrifice yourself to others, or to the greater good. It doesn’t mean anything unless it’s an actual sacrifice of something that’s meaningful to you. But I think as a statement of reality, I just don’t see the wisdom of it. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-166-1-kings-1718-2-chronicles-1819-song-of-solomon-5"&gt;Day 166 - 1 Kings 17–18 2 Chronicles 18–19 Song of Solomon 5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So there’s a showdown between Elisha and the prophets of Baal. He proposes a test, which of course Yahweh succeeds. It makes me think that if Yahweh was totally fine with this sort of test in the past why can’t we do it now? Why did they say you should not test the Lord thy God? And yet such stories occur in the Old Testament. Did God change?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-169-1-kings-22-2-chronicles-23-song-of-solomon-8"&gt;Day 169 - 1 Kings 22 2 Chronicles 23 Song of Solomon 8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seems as if God sends a lying spirit to the prophets of the enemy to undermine them.  How is that at all different than God lying himself?  How would you ever know if the prophets you have are telling the truth if this is a live option?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Song of Solomon seems to really like pomegranates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-170-2-kings-1-2-chronicles-24-psalm-69"&gt;Day 170 - 2 Kings 1 2 Chronicles 24 Psalm 69&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Psalms, it talked about giving vinegar to drink as a prophecy for the story of Jesus, and it makes me wonder if you were making the story of Jesus and you had only the Old Testament stories to go on, how much of the Jesus story would you be able to make? It almost seems as if the New Testament is fanfiction of the Old Testament. The miracles of Elisha seem very similar. The Psalms give almost every part of the crucifixion story. So if you were to say, write fanfiction in the style of the Old Testament, but set in the Roman time, you would pretty much get exactly the Gospel of Mark.  Just add some legendary embellishments, and some appearances and things like that and you get the other gospels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-171-2-kings-2-2-chronicles-25-psalm-70"&gt;Day 171 - 2 Kings 2 2 Chronicles 25 Psalm 70&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have the story of the Bears sent to kill 42 children because they called Elijah "baldy".  And in the name of the Lord, this was done. What are we to make of a story like that?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another one that reiterates the message that has occurred in a number of places, that the descendants of someone will not be killed for the transgressions of their ancestors. And yet we get the opposite message many times, because God seems to punish the children and the children’s children for the transgressions of the ancestor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fr. Schmitz has a pretty impressive dodge of the she-bear story. He essentially says that it may not be young boys, but could be young men -- basically ruffians -- and it wasn’t about an insult. It was about proper worship of God versus improper worship of God given where they were in the north as opposed to the south. I still think the moral argument against the story runs no matter what, but I find it really interesting that he has to do these contortions to try to get out of a fairly straightforward story and its consequences. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-173-2-kings-4-2-chronicles-28-psalm-127"&gt;Day 173  - 2 Kings 4 2 Chronicles 28 Psalm 127&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There’s a story of one of the kings of Judah, where he set up molten offerings to the old gods and sacrifices his own sons. In the commentary, Fr. Schmitz relates to the stories and comes very close to saying that it was terrible that the king sacrifices his sons in this way.  This would then clearly call into question the story of Jesus, so  Fr. Schmitz says the problem is not that he sacrificed his sons but that he sacrificed his sons &lt;em&gt;to the wrong God&lt;/em&gt;. It is very interesting hearing the contortions again trying to avoid saying anything bad about Jehovah.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-174-2-kings-5-hosea-13-psalm-101"&gt;Day 174 - 2 Kings 5 Hosea 1–3 Psalm 101&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fr. Schmitz  says that one of the common messages for the prophets is warning North Israel to change the ways or else God will let them go. He then stresses that this is not in conflict with God's patience being infinite, but that the story comes to an end just like our life comes to an end, and that we get whatever we’ve chosen and we get that for eternity. And I’m wondering why does it have to be like that? Why over such a tiny amount of time are we judged for eternity? Why not do it in a more gradual way? The first hundred years and then you get some kind of signal and then the next hundred years and another one?  Or maybe it should be like in &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4955642/"&gt;The Good Place&lt;/a&gt;? It just seems that Fr. Schmitz is insistent on making sure his view of God is  reasonable &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-182-2-kings-16-micah-14-psalm-139"&gt;Day 182 - 2 Kings 16 Micah 1–4 Psalm 139&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what way is the king sacrificing his sons is any worse than God sacrificing Jesus?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-183-2-kings-17-micah-57-psalm-140"&gt;Day 183 - 2 Kings 17 Micah 5–7 Psalm 140&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally an interesting tidbit.  The kingdom of Samaria of the north was broken up into five nations. Then in Jesus, his story about the woman who is the Samaritan, he says that she has had five husbands before and the one she is with now it’s not her husband. It just shows that so many stories are not just morality tales. They are literally drawn from aspects of the Old Testament stories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And then we having Micah prophecy of the one who will come from Bethlehem. Of course Fr. Schmitz takes this as prophecy but it’s so much easier to understand it, as the New Testament writers simply reading the Old Testament in writing stories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have to say that I really haven’t learned a whole lot from reading the Bible. I feel as if I could’ve learned just as much in a much shorter way.  This is the reason why I just want to get it done so I can say that I did it. This is not a meditation for me really.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-185-2-kings-19-2-chronicles-30-psalm-143"&gt;Day 185 - 2 Kings 19 2 Chronicles 30 Psalm 143&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There’s a story or prayer about how the Syrians are attacking a particular city, and a prayer states that God will not allow them to take the city.  There’s a story about how an angel of the Lord came down and wiped out much of the Syrians and the rest got sent home.   It seems as if they are in every single case when the people have a victory it’s God's doing, and when they have a defeat it’s because the people failed to do something. This is classic religious thinking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-195-isaiah-78-tobit-79-proverbs-105-8"&gt;Day 195 - Isaiah 7–8 Tobit 7–9 Proverbs 10:5-8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have the Isaiah so-called prophecy,  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 7 - 14 Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say "so-called" because the sign is for military victory for the king, and it actually happens &lt;em&gt;in the next verse&lt;/em&gt;.  There’s no hint at all that this was meant to be a prophecy for the future. It is much more reasonable to think that someone looking for details to put into the New Testament story would latch onto this and add it to the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just for reference, there is a long list of failed prophecies online:  &lt;a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Biblical_prophecies#Failed.2FUnfulfilled_prophecies"&gt;https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Biblical_prophecies#Wrong_prophecies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-197-isaiah-1113-tobit-1314-proverbs-1013-16"&gt;Day 197 - Isaiah 11–13 Tobit 13–14 Proverbs 10:13-16&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have a number of statements about the rise and fall of various countries, many of which are  true, some of which are demonstrably false. This really causes us to question the entire idea of prophecy in the Old Testament.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-202-isaiah-2324-habakkuk-12-proverbs-111-4"&gt;Day 202 - Isaiah 23–24 Habakkuk 1–2 Proverbs 11:1-4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 24 - Behold, the Lord will empty the earth[&lt;a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+24&amp;amp;version=ESV#fen-ESV-18097a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;] and make it desolate,  and he will twist its surface and scatter its inhabitants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They claim that the Earth will be scorched and bunch of things happen to "the Earth" but why is there not any mention of China or the Americas or any other lands other than the local lands of the author?  Did God not know about these?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-213-isaiah-4748-ezekiel-89-proverbs-1213-16"&gt;Day 213 - Isaiah 47–48 Ezekiel 8–9 Proverbs 12:13-16&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Son of man term used in a vision.  Not sure what this means&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have to say that these prophets are super tiring.  It’s the same message again and again.   Praise god for his greatness.  Israel, you’ve stopped following him and follow false gods and you will be or are being punished.  Rinse repeat repent.   &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-218-isaiah-5758-ezekiel-1718-proverbs-135-8"&gt;Day 218 -   Isaiah 57–58 Ezekiel 17–18 Proverbs 13:5-8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ezekiel 18:20 - 20 The soul who sins shall die. The son shall not suffer for the iniquity of the father, nor the father suffer for the iniquity of the son. The righteousness of the righteous shall be upon himself, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell that to everyone who has original sin.  Geesh.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another common theme in the prophets is how God will bring his people back to Israel from the scattered places, and there everyone will live happily ever after.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-223-isaiah-66-ezekiel-2526-proverbs-141-4"&gt;Day 223 - Isaiah 66 Ezekiel 25–26 Proverbs 14:1-4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The prediction that Tyre will be forever destroyed.  Let’s ask the people who live there today.  😀&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-241-jeremiah-2425-daniel-67-proverbs-165-8"&gt;Day 241 - Jeremiah 24–25 Daniel 6–7 Proverbs 16:5-8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God is going to show his wrath over the whole earth. All of the inhabitants of the earth. Of course, none of this is written in any other continent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-243-jeremiah-2829-daniel-1011-proverbs-1613-16"&gt;Day 243 - Jeremiah 28–29 Daniel 10–11 Proverbs 16:13-16&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;About Daniel 11, Fr. Schmitz says that the prophecies are so great that skeptics say it had to be written after the fact.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just after writing that last comment I read &lt;a href="https://infidels.org/library/modern/chris-sandoval-daniel/"&gt;another author talking about Daniel&lt;/a&gt;.   I wanted to see how it was dated. There is this gem:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many critical scholars attribute the obvious historical errors of the book of Daniel to naïveté. I find it more likely that the author generally knew what he was doing and wrote honest anachronistic inspirational fiction, the literary equivalent of the faith-promoting &lt;em&gt;Left Behind&lt;/em&gt; series of our own time. His friends and contemporaries already expected God to set up the messianic kingdom very soon in their own lifetimes, and his cycle of short stories regarding Daniel merely gave literary expression to their preexisting beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-251-jeremiah-4142-judith-1214-proverbs-1713-16"&gt;Day 251 - Jeremiah 41–42 Judith 12–14 Proverbs 17:13-16&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So we are finishing up the book of Judith. And essentially it’s a story about this Jewish woman who goes and infiltrates the Assyrians and devises a way to be alone with the leader, and then chops his head off delivers the head to the Jewish people so that they can win. They claim that God is with them and hasn’t left them. What am I supposed to learn from this? As far as I can tell this is yet another barbaric story from a barbaric people justifying their barbaric actions by saying that God is with them.  Is this really the best that an omnibenevolent, omnipotent, omnipresent agent can do? There’s just no hint that this is inspired by anything greater than the barbaric people that they’re talking about.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m reminded about some thing Matt Dillahunty had said about how religion distorts morality. The theist always claims that the source of morality is God and that you can’t be moral without God. Or they say that the atheist is either not moral or borrowing it from religion. But when I look at this, we pretty much have an act that is directly murder. It is a violation of one of the 10 Commandments. It is immoral. It is brutal. And then it is celebrated. And then Fr. Schmitz has the audacity to say things like Judith‘s virtuousness was never lost. Her purity was never lost. And that this murderous act was a theme with several other cases where someone chopped off their head or put a spike through their head, or Mary steps on the head of the snake. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pretty much if you can argue an action and it’s direct opposite are both moral then you have lost your way. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not sure if I mentioned this but way back when when they were list of names in the Vhronicles, Fr. Schmitz said something about he had a prayer where he was thanking God and he mentioned how these names were important, even though we only had a name and we didn’t know anything else about them. The problem with that is that if they were important, then we would have more than just names, and the fact that we only have the names really does speak to the level of ineptitude of the communication with ancient books. It also speaks to the fact that Fr. Schmitz is going to say everything is important in this book whether it seems so or not. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-259-matthew-57-proverbs-1821-24"&gt;Day 259 - Matthew 5–7 Proverbs 18:21-24&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is the one with the sermon on the mount. I’m reminded of &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/i2V5ZWVUpn8"&gt;Matt Dillahunty’s covering of the Sermon on the Mount&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes from that video follow here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The early part of the sermon essentially says that while things are bad now, they will get better -- either in this life or the next&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This makes it so that people are less likely to try to get out of bad situations -- it helped keep women and slaves in marginalized positions for centuries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Matt 5:7-9 - a naive reward system for good behavior.  Be merciful so that you'll get mercy from god, etc...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10-12 -- Encourages divisiveness through the expectation of persecution.  When they think they are being persecuted (either correctly or incorrectly) they believe they are doing the right thing by God&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Matt 5:16 says let your light shine.... Matt 6:1 says the opposite, and is confusing at best&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5:21-26: Thought crimes as equivalent to murder.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5:27-28: More thought crimes, lust is not adultery.  Also it's sexist (whomsoever looks at a woman lustfully) -- why is God sexist here?  Same with 31-32.  Also bad advice -- suffer through marriages that don't include infidelity, no matter how bad they are.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5:37 - Good advice, keep your word. of course the "don't swear oaths dictate" is not followed by Christians -- they swear on bibles, etc...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;38-39: Justice doesn't have to fall on the extremes of vengeance and pacifism.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encourages victimization.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;43-44: Love your enemies is not reasonable or practiced (even by Jesus who will torture enemies forever)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Matt 6:6 -- pray in private.  good advice that is not taken.&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"proper adherence to this verse implies that prayer shouldn't be in school at all it means that we shouldn't be swearing people and on Bibles shouldn't open city council meetings with prayers we shouldn't have a Christian television network public prayer meetings the National Day of Prayer etc Christians who support these goals are hypocrites they're willfully disobeying a direct order that they believe is from Jesus it's not like they're disobeying Paul or John this is supposed to be the words of their Savior and they chuck it aside proving that they are their own God making their own rules&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6:25-34: Live for today, God will take care of you.  Bad advice.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7:1-6: Don't be a hypocrite -- good advice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't cast your pearls before swine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7:12: Golden rule is not original with jesus, or the Old Testament.&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Jesus's version while fairly good is actually one of the poorer versions I've seen. Saying "do unto others what you would have them do to you" isn't nearly as wise as "do unto others as they would have you do unto them".   I might like somebody to be brutally honest with me but they might prefer that I sugarcoat my words and it's better to treat them in the way that they want and encourage them to treat you in the way that you want"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there are other things other sayings that may be even better like "strive to do as much good as possible and as little harm as possible". Why didn't Jesus say something like that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Matt 7:15-23 the second part contradicts the first.  Either you are judged by your works or you aren't.  It also calls into question the belief necessity for salvation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-261-matthew-1113-proverbs-195-8"&gt;Day 261 - Matthew 11–13 Proverbs 19:5-8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 12 - 38 Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered him, saying, “Teacher, we wish to see a sign from you.” 39 But he answered them, “An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. 40 &lt;strong&gt;For just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you look at the resurrection narratives this doesn't add up (you can see &lt;a href="http://localhost:8000/search.html?q=resurrection"&gt;my posts about the Resurrection here&lt;/a&gt;) -- Friday night to Sunday morning is not "three days and three nights"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus was asked why speak in parables, and he essentially gave the classic conspiracy theory answer, which is so that you would have secret knowledge, and the others would be ignorant. This is one way that groups that share conspiracy theories maintain their community by giving its members the illusion that they have secret knowledge that no one else has. This may have helped Christianity to spread. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fr. Schmitz says that in the story there are those that saw miracles and didn’t believe. So if you think that you’ll believe if you see a miracle that may not be true. At least for me if I see a verified miracle I would at least pay attention. Otherwise, how can I possibly take any of this stuff seriously?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-262-matthew-1417-proverbs-199-12"&gt;Day 262 - Matthew 14–17 Proverbs 19:9-12&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seems as if the Peter "on this rock" quote is omitted in the Gospel of Mark?  seems like an odd omission.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-266-matthew-2728-proverbs-1925-29"&gt;Day 266 - Matthew 27–28 Proverbs 19:25-29&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So the story with Barabbas, which means "son of the father" and a parallel with Passover it makes it so obvious this is a &lt;em&gt;literary construction&lt;/em&gt; and not historical. Also, the resurrection description in Matthew has guards and an angel and the rolling away of the stone and all this other stuff which Mark does not mention.  (you can see &lt;a href="http://localhost:8000/search.html?q=resurrection"&gt;my posts about the Resurrection here&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are the Saints coming out of their graves and wandering around the town something that Mark wouldn’t have wanted to write about?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-271-ezra-910-zechariah-911-proverbs-2016-19"&gt;Day 271 - Ezra 9–10 Zechariah 9–11 Proverbs 20:16-19&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zechariah 9 - Behold, your king is coming to you;&lt;br&gt;
    righteous and having salvation is he,&lt;br&gt;
    humble and mounted on a donkey,&lt;br&gt;
    on a colt, the foal of a donkey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zechariah 11:13 Then the Lord said to me, “Throw it to the potter”—the lordly price at which I was priced by them. So I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them into the house of the Lord, to the potter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Here in the Old Testament, we have the riding in on a colt, the foal of a colt and even have 30 pieces of silver reference. I wonder how many of the New Testament stories are literally just re-reading older Old Testament stories. The loaves and fishes seems to come from Elijah, all of the crucifixion narratives seem to come from the Psalms.  It’s actually impressive what little there is left if you take away all of the Old Testament stories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although most of my comments are negative, there are a number of good things about this particular podcast. First, I really like the commentary and the fact that Fr. Schmitz repeats a lot of who the names are and warns you about things that are confusing.  It’s also very useful to be an audio format so that you can listen to it when you’re driving or you’re just doing yard work or something that is mindless so that way you can focus on the text. I find that I won’t tend to skip forward where, if I’m reading, I might skim or skip passages. It’s also interesting because I was brought up Catholic but my recent exposure has been with fundamentalist evangelicals and so hearing the Catholic interpretation of some of the passages is pretty interesting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, I find that much of this is a waste of time. The book is so repetitive and doesn’t have a lot of content. I could’ve probably gotten the content in less than a 10th of the time if it was presented in a different way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the nice things about the Bible in a day is that it breaks up the books and reads from several in a day.  Things like proverbs or the long list of names in chronicles is more valuable reading a small amount per day rather than going through in order.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-280-nehemiah-12-esther-911-proverbs-2121-24"&gt;Day 280 - Nehemiah 12 Esther 9–11 Proverbs 21:21-24&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we have a story about Esther, who is a Jew, and is also queen and some people arrange to have all the Jews killed, so what does she do? She goes to the king and has a guy who organized that executed and then the king organizes essentially a mass slaughter of everyone who was against the Jews. This is one barbaric story after another one,  One side doesn’t like the other side so they’re going to kill them all and then then whoever has the power just kills the other people.   I mean it’s just a ludicrous story if you’re trying to get any kind of moral message out of this. Is this really the best that the creator of the universe, the all-good God can arrange?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Son of god, Prince of peace, Ushered in the good news of the world.  These terms were applied to Caesar Augustus, before Jesus came. And Fr. Schmitz spins this as setting the stage for Jesus.  It seems more likely that these terms were simply lifted, and applied to Jesus so that people would make the connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-291-1-maccabees-10-sirach-2627-proverbs-235-8"&gt;Day 291 - 1 Maccabees 10 Sirach 26–27 Proverbs 23:5-8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots of stuff about the good wife. This is in the book of Sirach.  So Fr. Schmitz spins this as talking about both wives and husbands, or at least applicable to husbands as well. It’s pretty amazing when the book says something and you don’t like it you just make up that it says something different.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-305-2-maccabees-8-wisdom-56-proverbs-2430-34"&gt;Day 305 - 2 Maccabees 8 Wisdom 5–6 Proverbs 24:30-34&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fr. Schmitz says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"it is difficult to see God's working in our lives, what is he really doing?  Is this God's justice, is this just an accident of evil, is this part of his mercy?  But to have the eyes that are looking to see, eyes looking to understand, but they always are the eyes of trust.  Here's what I mean.  Sometimes we can say 'Gosh I think I must have done something wrong to be experiencing this pain, or maybe I'm being corrected by the Lord himself.'  But we dont have any idea why, we're just guessing at this.  So it's kind of sometimes a risk to look at our lives and say 'This is what God is doing' but it is not a risk to say 'God is present and active'.  Hopefully that make sense.  I don't always know, God what are you doing in this moment but be able to say 'God I know that you're here and you're doing &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;'.  That is something we can really rest on, that is where the trust comes being able to say this is not you abandoning me, Lord, this is not you giving up on me this is not being disqualified from your word or from  your promises, but you're here and you're active.  you're present and you're doing something.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there anything you couldn't believe using thinking like this?  Is this a way to think that brings you closer to truth, or to confirmation bias, and exaggerated pattern recognition?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 Maccabees and 2 Maccabees are interesting -- I haven't read them before.  I'm noting most of the New Testament names, which undermines Bauckham's thesis.  2 Maccabees has the same stories but interpreting all of them as God acting.  There are some stirring stories of martyrdom in 2 Maccabees.  Still a lot of repetition, and wishful thinking, and post-hoc rationalizations.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So they say that parables are a common way for rabbis to communicate. They draw people in. I think another reason is that they are vague enough to be interpreted in multiple ways so they’re more flexible. I think that Christianity's success has more to do with the fact that one can apply the messages to any situation. Fr. Schmitz also commented how the visitation to Mary of John the Baptist's mother parallels second Samuel 6 -- a number of the phrases are the same. Again much more Old Testament being used to construct the stories for the New Testament.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-314-luke-35-proverbs-2527-28"&gt;Day 314 - Luke 3–5 Proverbs 25:27-28&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The census in the gospel of Luke makes no sense. There’s no way that you would be called back to the town &lt;em&gt;of your ancestors from 800 years ago&lt;/em&gt;. That’s just ludicrous.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The lineage is also problematic. It disagrees with Matthews and it has different numbers of generations and it disagrees &lt;em&gt;even on the grandfather&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-319-luke-1719-proverbs-2613-16"&gt;Day 319 - Luke 17–19 Proverbs 26:13-16&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parable of the rich man. One of Fr. Schmitz’s responses is that it’s not about just  hearing the word of God it is about acting on the word of God . I think that’s a pretty good statement for pretty much any reading or life advice, or anything else. It’s not enough to just read advice -- you need to act on it. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-320-luke-202238-proverbs-2617-19"&gt;Day 320 - Luke 20–22:38 Proverbs 26:17-19&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Listening to Jesus, his description of the destruction of the temple sounds a lot like the various prophets in the Old Testament. Especially when he says this generation will not pass before they see the kingdom of God coming again. Essentially the things that the author knew about and wrote down are correct and the things in the future that are predicted and are not correct. It’s actually amazing how it follows that same pattern. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s also interesting to see that the form of the predictions are all the same. Essentially decrying the bad behavior of the people and God coming in and enacting punishment  This is followed by a prediction that God is going to come back and beat all the bad guys and everyone will live happily ever after. Except of course the bad guys.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-321-luke-22392450-proverbs-2620-23"&gt;Day 321 - Luke 22:39–24:50 Proverbs 26:20-23&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The robber on the cross.  "Today you will be with me.""  But isn’t Jesus dead for three days?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The two travelers on the road to Amaus has a direct parallel with Roman story about Romulus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots of appearances where he wants to demonstrate that he has a body -- while at the same time disappearing and walking through walls. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a contrast between the directions Jesus gives on where to meet afterward -- Luke says Jerusalem and Matthew says Galilee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-322-acts-1-romans-1-proverbs-2624-26"&gt;Day 322 - Acts 1 Romans 1 Proverbs 26:24-26&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Robert M Price describes Acts as the Catholic response to Marcione.  Essentially the goal is to take people who like Paul, and say that Peter is just like Paul. And to take people who like Peter and say, Paul is just like Peter.  Essentially whitewashing the real disagreement between these two different groups of original Christians -- the ones that were all for the adherence to the Jewish laws (including circumcision) and those that were not.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acts of the Apostles has a different reason for why the field of blood is called the field of blood. This has to do with Judas hangING himself, and his guts spilling all over the field as opposed to the field being purchased by the blood money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-324-acts-3-romans-45-proverbs-271-3"&gt;Day 324 - Acts 3 Romans 4–5 Proverbs 27:1-3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So there’s a story about Peter healing someone who can walk. This happens all the way up to the temple. Fr. Schmitz asked why is he coming up to the temple? That is because they’re Jews and that the old law is still in effect. So part of the goal of that is to counter the Christian sect of the Marciones, who believed that the Old Testament God was not the same God that Jesus was talking about.  So these reminders about Peter's Judaism is also part of the plan to make Peter palatable to those who are fans of Paul.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-326-acts-5-romans-8-proverbs-277-9"&gt;Day 326 - Acts 5 Romans 8 Proverbs 27:7-9&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acts of the Apostles just feels like propaganda for the Christian church. The stories of them being thrown in jail and then escaping with an angel. The back and forth with the elders and the Sadducees,  and at no point do we have anyone looking for a dead body. Given an empty tomb, one of the major things that would’ve happened, would be a search for grave robbing, of which the disciples would be the number one suspects. We get no sense of that at all. We also get no sense of having Jesus's family appearing anywhere.  Like where is Mary right now? Also, it wouldn’t matter whether the cell was locked -- the people no longer in it would also be reason for them to get thrown into a more secure location.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Listening to the letters of Paul I have this very strange feeling. I hear the words, but I get no contact at all. I feel like I’m learning nothing at all from what he saying, as if he’s saying nothing at all, a string of &lt;a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Deepity"&gt;deepities&lt;/a&gt;. He goes around and around and I don’t even know what his point is. It’s pretty wild. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-328-acts-7-romans-1112-proverbs-2713-14"&gt;Day 328 - Acts 7 Romans 11–12 Proverbs 27:13-14&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So I started watching &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/B5MUUP4l6l4"&gt;Richard Carrier's video about Acts as Historical Fiction&lt;/a&gt; and there are a number of very interesting things. He claims that Mark was written first and essentially was putting forward the idea that Christianity was not just for Jews. And this is seen with one of the themes about the least shall be most and it subverts expectations. Then Matthew comes along as a response to Mark and essentially says no no no no you have to be Jewish and he highlights all the Jewish things that Mark did not do. Then Luke comes along as a response to Mark. Carrier says that the Q document doesn’t actually exist and it’s not well supported  -- that Luke is actually a response to Matthew. And in Luke’s Gospel he’s trying have the perspective that  you don’t need to be Jewish to be Christian -- but really trying to make the two sides see eye to eye. And then Acts is  propaganda to really try to merge those two perspectives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-336-acts-15-1-corinthians-1112-proverbs-2810-12"&gt;Day 336 - Acts 15 1 Corinthians 11–12 Proverbs 28:10-12&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fr. Schmitz says that scripture clearly states that men and women are equal. I really don’t understand where that could possibly come from.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-345-acts-24-galatians-13-proverbs-2912-14"&gt;Day 345 - Acts 24 Galatians 1–3 Proverbs 29:12-14&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In his letter to the Galatians, Paul writes that he did not receive the gospel from any man, but only by Revelation. He then talks about his trip to Arabia right after, and he didn’t go to Jerusalem for quite a while, which is in conflict with story in Acts. It also highlights his disagreements with Peter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-348-acts-27-ephesians-46-proverbs-2922-24"&gt;Day 348 - Acts 27 Ephesians 4–6 Proverbs 29:22-24&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So Fr. Schmitz comments that when you go on a trip and you get some adversity, you’ll have to question whether you should be on that trip at all. And then he contrasts that with Paul who has all sorts of problems on his trips, but says that this is God’s will, and so was able to see those hardships in a new light. This is actually a good attitude to have and I think the stoics have the same attitude, but without all of the superstition. So the point is that the Christian faith is not always problematic. It has some good things and it has some advice that does actually help you through adversity.  When you feel like you’ve messed up, Christianity offers you a way to feel forgiven and move on. These are all very good things but they come at the cost of believing a whole bunch of false things. The ideal would be to somehow obtain the benefits of those things without believing false things. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-362-revelation-1214-hebrews-14-proverbs-3119-22"&gt;Day 362 - Revelation 12–14 Hebrews 1–4 Proverbs 31:19-22&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fr. Schmitz tells the story of the miracle at Guadalupe.  I doubt things happened the way he says but I’ll look into it.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-365-revelation-2122-hebrews-1113-proverbs-3130-31"&gt;Day 365 - Revelation 21–22 Hebrews 11–13 Proverbs 31:30-31&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So I’m done. Fr. Schmitz actually cried when he said goodbye on the last day. I really do appreciate his earnestness and his sense of humor. And even though I don’t agree with nearly anything that he says, in terms of content, I do thank him for the amount of time and effort that he put into this and his honest communication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So this is the second time I’ve gone through the Bible.  The first time I read it using a student Bible so I could understand what was going on but I felt that I skimmed a number of things and then paused to consider some of the stories.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I like the fact that I did it once as text and once being read to me. I think both have value. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don’t think I will ever do this again. It’s an incredible amount of time. The advantage to the podcast is that you can be doing other things at the same time so it’s a bit more efficient time-wise but either way it is a big investment in time and I just don’t find the text itself to be very efficient in terms of the lessons that it’s trying to give . And I think that means that people just don’t read it. It’s probably good to read through once, but I am not going to do this again. However, I will read passages here and there and I will keep responding to religious claims where I see them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is my hope that I go through my notes here and compile them together so that I have a response to doing the Bible in a Year .&lt;/li&gt;

In a number of debates, but more famously &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/a-wIaCRIdOA?feature=share"&gt;this one with Jonathan McLatchie&lt;/a&gt;, Matt Dillahunty states that "claims are not evidence".  It became so heated that it led to the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/a-wIaCRIdOA?feature=share&amp;amp;t=4763"&gt;infamous rage-quit by Johnathan&lt;/a&gt;.     &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/a-wIaCRIdOA?feature=share&amp;amp;t=8755"&gt;Matt later clarifies&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;propositions&lt;/em&gt; are never evidence, and he's separating the idea of a claim from its context (i.e. the person stating it). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there were a number of Twitter threads like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pasted image 20230326194340.png" src="https://bblais.github.io/images/Pasted image 20230326194340.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pasted image 20230327100009.png" src="https://bblais.github.io/images/Pasted image 20230327100009.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pasted image 20230327100027.png" src="https://bblais.github.io/images/Pasted image 20230327100027.png"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Pasted image 20230327100056.png" src="https://bblais.github.io/images/Pasted image 20230327100056.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/OjtMYgCgLYo"&gt;Paulogia weighs in&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like most of these arguments, it comes down to the definitions and being very careful with the vocabulary.  Let's start with the definition of evidence from the &lt;a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evidence/"&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the following probabilistic explication of what it is for &lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt; to be evidence for &lt;em&gt;H&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt; is evidence for &lt;em&gt;H&lt;/em&gt; if and only if Prob(&lt;em&gt;H&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt;) &amp;gt; Prob(&lt;em&gt;H&lt;/em&gt;).[&lt;a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evidence/notes.html#23"&gt;23&lt;/a&gt; ]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, &lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt; is evidence for &lt;em&gt;H&lt;/em&gt; just in case the conditional probability of &lt;em&gt;H&lt;/em&gt; on &lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt; is greater than the unconditional probability of &lt;em&gt;H&lt;/em&gt;. Thus, the fact that &lt;em&gt;the suspect's blood is on the knife&lt;/em&gt; is evidence for the hypothesis that &lt;em&gt;the suspect committed the murder&lt;/em&gt; if and only if the probability that the suspect committed the murder is greater given that his blood is on the knife than it would be otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt; is evidence against &lt;em&gt;H&lt;/em&gt; if and only if Prob(&lt;em&gt;H&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt;) &amp;lt; Prob(&lt;em&gt;H&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, &lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt; is evidence against &lt;em&gt;H&lt;/em&gt; just in case the conditional probability of &lt;em&gt;H&lt;/em&gt; on &lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt; is less than the unconditional probability of &lt;em&gt;H&lt;/em&gt;. Thus, the fact that &lt;em&gt;the suspect's fingerprints are not on the knife_is evidence against the hypothesis that _the suspect committed the murder&lt;/em&gt; if and only if the probability that the suspect committed the murder is lower given the absence of his fingerprints on the knife than it would be otherwise. Within this probabilistic model, verification (in the sense of conclusive confirmation) would involve bestowing probability 1 on an hypothesis while falsification would involve bestowing probability 0 on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with the word "claim" is that it seems to combine both the proposition (which is not evidence) and the fact that a person is making the claim (which can add some degree of evidence). This is a matter of usage. If you can substitute in your sentence the word "proposition" for "claim" then it will not be evidence. But in a sentence like "Matt claims to have a dog" you can't do that, so the word is mixed and thus may be evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposition “it’s five o’clock” is non evidential. Someone saying it - even if they are conveying a “fact” - does carry evidence. A fact is just that thing which has a high posterior probability. Someone making it a statement is just a recognition that for that person they have a high posterior for that statement and thus don’t feel compelled to defend it. In English if you said “So and so &lt;em&gt;claims&lt;/em&gt; that it is 5 o’clock” there is an implied negative -- it implies that you don’t believe them. I think that’s because in most cases where someone says it is 5 o'clock, that it is such a mundane claim (priors are high) and it is unlikely that someone would lie or be seriously mistaken (alternatives are unlikely) that we need not question the high the posterior. When we stress the word &lt;em&gt;claim&lt;/em&gt; in the sentence, it implies the negative.  The reason why someone gets upset at having to defend it doesn’t have anything to do with the statement-claim distinctions and everything to do with the implied conclusion of this questioning: you think they are either lying or seriously mistaken on a trivial statement/claim. They would take offense at that — rightly so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now someone making the statement “Jesus rose from the dead” they may actually believe it as a fact. Is this a claim or statement? Does it provide evidence? I’d say this is a claim like the ones above but does not provide evidence for the claim because the prior is super low and the alternatives could be made more likely given this statement and no other evidence (because many people make similar statements and have always been shown wrong). This means that the statement/testimony may not increase the posterior (it may in fact lower it).  Again, I don’t see the useful distinction between statement and claim except perhaps as a label where, perhaps, a statement is an indication of a high prior and a claim focuses more on the likelihood part of the probability?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="religion"></category></entry><entry><title>Walking through 6 Ways to Use ChatGPT to Learn Code</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2023/Feb/04/walking-through-6-ways-to-use-chatgpt-to-learn-code/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-02-04T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-02-04T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2023-02-04:/posts/2023/Feb/04/walking-through-6-ways-to-use-chatgpt-to-learn-code/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I was poking around on the web and decided to watch the video "THE Game Changer for Learning to Code"  https://www.youtube.com/embed/H1fBdboJeBo and then attempt …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I was poking around on the web and decided to watch the video "THE Game Changer for Learning to Code"  https://www.youtube.com/embed/H1fBdboJeBo and then attempt to use it on code I use in class.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TLDR:  Describing vocabulary, describing code, making suggestions for improving code, and finding resources all very useful.  Generating code is super dangerous (ChatGPT makes incorrect code) and using it in many cases can be considered plagiarism, just as if you copied from another person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="describing-vocabulary-useful"&gt;Describing vocabulary -- useful&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started with,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ME&lt;/strong&gt;:  you're a professor trying to teach a student about euler's method. how would you phrase it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/strong&gt;:
Euler's method is a numerical method used to approximate the solution to a first-order ordinary differential equation (ODE). It is a simple and straightforward way of approximating the solution by using the tangent line to the solution curve at a given point. The basic idea behind Euler's method is to divide the interval of interest into smaller sub-intervals and then estimate the value of the solution at the end of each sub-interval by using the tangent line. This process is then repeated, starting at the end of each sub-interval, until the desired level of accuracy is reached. Euler's method is a powerful tool for solving ODEs and is widely used in many scientific and engineering applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not bad.  Seems useful to describe vocabulary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="describing-code-useful"&gt;Describing code -- useful&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I gave it some code I used in class,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ME:&lt;/strong&gt; Can you explain what this code is doing: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x_start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;x_end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;step&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Storage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x_start&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x_end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# print(x,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;,end=&amp;quot;&amp;quot;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;y_left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fun&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;step&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;y_right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fun&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;step&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y_right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y_left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;step&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# rise over run&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# saving the result for later&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;step&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;done.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;arrays&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# give me the saved results as two arrays&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/strong&gt;: This code is implementing a numerical method called the midpoint method to estimate the derivative of a function &lt;code&gt;fun&lt;/code&gt; over a range &lt;code&gt;x_start&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;x_end&lt;/code&gt; with a step size &lt;code&gt;step&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Storage&lt;/code&gt; class is used to store the results of the midpoint method at each iteration. The &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; variable is initialized to &lt;code&gt;x_start&lt;/code&gt; and the loop continues until &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is greater than &lt;code&gt;x_end&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each iteration, the values of the function &lt;code&gt;fun&lt;/code&gt; at &lt;code&gt;x-step/2&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;x+step/2&lt;/code&gt; are calculated and stored in &lt;code&gt;y_left&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;y_right&lt;/code&gt; respectively. The derivative at the midpoint &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is then estimated as the rise over run &lt;code&gt;m = (y_right - y_left) / step&lt;/code&gt;. The result is stored in the &lt;code&gt;Storage&lt;/code&gt; object &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt; using the &lt;code&gt;+=&lt;/code&gt; operator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, after the loop, the results stored in &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt; are retrieved as two arrays &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt; using the &lt;code&gt;arrays()&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The midpoint method is a simple numerical method to estimate the derivative of a function. It is based on the idea that the derivative of a function at a point can be estimated as the average rate of change over a small interval around that point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is really impressive, and I think quite useful for students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="improving-code-somewhat-useful"&gt;Improving code -- somewhat useful&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ME:&lt;/strong&gt; how would you improve that code?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT:&lt;/strong&gt;  Here are a few suggestions to improve the code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use functions: You can define the midpoint method as a function and reuse it for different functions and different intervals. This makes the code more modular and easier to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Document the code: Adding comments and documentation to the code can help someone who is unfamiliar with the code understand what it does. For example, you can add a comment explaining the purpose of the code and what each variable represents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Input validation: You can add input validation to check if the step size &lt;code&gt;step&lt;/code&gt; is positive and non-zero. You can also add input validation to check if the interval &lt;code&gt;x_start&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;x_end&lt;/code&gt; is well-defined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;numpy&lt;/code&gt; arrays: The &lt;code&gt;numpy&lt;/code&gt; library provides arrays that are optimized for numerical computations. Instead of using the &lt;code&gt;Storage&lt;/code&gt; class, you can use &lt;code&gt;numpy&lt;/code&gt; arrays to store the results of the midpoint method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plotting: You can use a plotting library such as &lt;code&gt;matplotlib&lt;/code&gt; to visualize the results of the midpoint method. This can be helpful in understanding the results and detecting any issues with the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By making these changes, you can make the code more readable, reusable, and understandable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of this is good.  I laugh at (2) because I notoriously do not put documentation in.  Perhaps I should use ChatGPT to document my class code?  I don't use (4) for a couple of reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you need to know ahead of time how many values you need to save if you use arrays&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is extra boilerplate code for setting up the initial arrays, and saving the data in the right indices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Storage()&lt;/code&gt; class I made solves these problems, and is &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2020/Feb/24/common-python-pattern-building-up-lists-to-plot/"&gt;discussed in more detail here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, ChatGPT wouldn't be expected to know that, but it does highlight some limitations.   We do (5) in later cells, and will do (1) later, but this code was just an introduction.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="new-code-dangerous"&gt;New code -- dangerous!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ME:&lt;/strong&gt;  how would you use this code to find the minimum and maximum of a function? please show the resulting code&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I was looking for is to use the derivative code above, find where it equals (or is close to) zero and return those points.  What I got was &lt;strong&gt;incorrect code&lt;/strong&gt; described perfectly.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT:&lt;/strong&gt; To find the minimum and maximum of a function using this code, you can modify the code to keep track of the minimum and maximum values of the derivative. If the derivative at a point is zero, it means that the function has a local extremum (minimum or maximum) at that point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's an updated version of the code that finds the minimum and maximum of a function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;numpy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;midpoint_method&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fun&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x_start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x_end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;step&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x_start&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;min_x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;max_x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;min_m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;max_m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x_end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;y_left&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;fun&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;step&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;y_right&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;fun&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;step&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y_right&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;y_left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;step&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;min_m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;or&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;min_m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;min_m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;min_x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;max_m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;or&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;max_m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;max_m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;max_x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;step&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;min_x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;min_m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;max_x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;max_m&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;x_start&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;x_end&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;step&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;min_x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;min_m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;max_x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;max_m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;midpoint_method&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fun&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x_start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x_end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;step&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Minimum at x=&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;min_x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot; with derivative &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;min_m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Maximum at x=&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;max_x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot; with derivative &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;max_m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this updated version of the code, a function &lt;code&gt;midpoint_method&lt;/code&gt; is defined to encapsulate the midpoint method. The function takes four arguments: &lt;code&gt;fun&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;x_start&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;x_end&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;step&lt;/code&gt;. The function returns four values: the &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;-coordinates and the values of the minimum and maximum derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the main part of the code, the &lt;code&gt;midpoint_method&lt;/code&gt; function is called with the input parameters, and the results are stored in &lt;code&gt;min_x&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;min_m&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;max_x&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;max_m&lt;/code&gt;. Finally, the minimum and maximum are printed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This printed the &lt;strong&gt;minimum and maximum of the derivative not the function&lt;/strong&gt;.  Unless you knew what was going on, this would be seriously dangerous to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pasted image 20220723111642.png" src="https://bblais.github.io/images/Pasted image 20220723111642.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;@MetaChristianity then references &lt;a href="https://lastedenblog.wordpress.com/2016/06/06/god-vs-the-gods/"&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt; to point out my "category error".  The post summarizes the difference between the "God" of the so-called "serious theists" and what I was apparently responding to.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any serious discussion about theism, it is absolutely crucial to distinguish between God and the gods. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you don’t understand this distinction, you will literally never understand what serious theists are talking about&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is, by definition, the Absolute. The one, absolute, unconditioned ground and source of all that is; the Alpha and the Omega, as Christian scripture puts it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term "source of all that is" comes up a lot in these descriptions, and I am baffled about several things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How is this not just word salad?  I can make any definition I want, but that doesn't guarantee I am saying anything meaningful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When we say that something is a &lt;em&gt;source&lt;/em&gt; of something, then we should be able to specify some of its properties.  For example, if we say that the source of the large rotation speeds of galaxies is dark matter, we are saying that dark matter (whatever it is) has mass -- or at least a gravitational effect -- and we can quantify the effect, the cases where we see the source and where we don't, we can rule out some of the things that dark matter isn't, etc...  What properties does this Alpha and Omega have?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why call it "God"?  That word has a lot of baggage, and is commonly (and historically) used to refer to an &lt;em&gt;agent&lt;/em&gt; which answers prayers, produces miraculous events (both modern and historical), and fine-tunes universal constants.  If "source of all that is" is a different thing than this, then use a different word or you run the risk of equivocation.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why think the "Alpha and Omega" is a mind at all?  Why not just some brute property of the universe, like the laws of logic or abstract numbers?  How could you tell?  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can you possibly get from this nebulous "source of all that is" to the stories in a religious text?  If the "serious theist" wants to say that some of those stories and claims in those texts are actually true, then they become testable (and have failed as far as I can tell).  If  the "serious theist" wants to say that these stories are just metaphors, then the texts hold the same content as Harry Potter books -- nice stories that might give some life lessons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I come back to the idea that if this "source of all that is" has any discernible impact on our lives, then it is measurable and thus testable empirically.  If not, then it has no use and is indistinguishable from nothing.  The "serious theist" can state all they want that "the existence of God is not an empirical question" but all they are saying is that their claims are just empty words.  &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="religion"></category><category term="religion"></category><category term="philosophy"></category></entry><entry><title>Why undesigned coincidences are not compelling to me</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2022/Jul/11/why-undesigned-coincidences-are-not-compelling-to-me/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-07-11T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2022-07-11T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2022-07-11:/posts/2022/Jul/11/why-undesigned-coincidences-are-not-compelling-to-me/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;An "undesigned coincidence" is used in an argument for the reliability of the Gospels, notable by Jonathan McLatchie, Tim McGrew and Lydia McGrew, and &lt;a href="https://jonathanmclatchie.com/yes-richard-carrier-there-are-undesigned-coincidences-part-1/"&gt;is defined as&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have multiple (at least two) accounts that report an event where one account answers in passing a natural question raised incidentally by the other.  Such features are &lt;em&gt;evidence&lt;/em&gt; that a real event lies behind the reports found in the gospels — that is to say, the presence of an undesigned coincidence is more probable given the hypothesis of historicism than given the annulment of that hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I am exploring an "undesigned coincidence" &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/8BQDcl7nOX8?t=2880"&gt;as described by Lydia McGrew&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the grass being green mentioned in Mark at the time, and it's Passover time mentioned in John, and each of these is mentioned only in one Gospel.  This fits together because the grass would be green around that time in Galilee.  So an ur-source theory would be that there would be one source, not reality, that mentioned both that the grass was green and that it was Passover time.  And that John just put down part of that and Mark just put down part of that, but it all came from this sort-of thing which was some version of the story that had both details in it.  What Jonathan means about simplicity is basically what you've done is taken a hypothetical source and given it the properties of reality, and put it up there instead of reality and you have space between that and the alleged hypothetical source and reality where it could be false -- the source might or might not be telling the truth.  Whereas if we just  attribute these characteristics -- the grass and the time of year -- to reality it is simpler than attributing them to this lost documentary source.  And then as he was also pointing out we have apparent discrepancies between the different accounts of the feeding of the 5000 which doesn't fit at all well with the idea of a lost source that by-jove looks like reality and people just took different parts of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tracking this description &lt;a href="https://christian-apologist.com/2022/07/02/undesigned-coincidences-in-the-feeding-of-the-5000/"&gt;a little bit more&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Mark 6:30-43, we learn that the crowd sat down on “green” grass and in John, we learn there was “much grass.” In John 6:1-14, we learn the event took place when the Passover was at hand.
The green grass corroborates the timing because the event likely took place during Israel’s rainy season, which runs from October through April. During the Passover in April, the grass would be abundant and green as it had been raining for months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The argument seems to be that because Mark mentions green grass (which doesn't add to the plot of the story) and John mentions Passover and some grass, that the best explanation of this overlap is that the miraculous event of the feeding of the 5000 actually happened.  Further that an "ur-source" which has both green grass and Passover is less likely, because we then have to posit the existence of a text or oral tradition that we don't have direct access to.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am always supremely underwhelmed with these so-called coincidences, every time I've been presented with them -- they really do seem strained.  For example, here are a few possibilities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both the authors of Mark and John were there, noted the grass and Passover, and wrote their accounts from the shared experience (McGrew's theory)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There was a text or oral story which mentions both the green grass and the Passover&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There was a story (oral or written) that just had Passover, and no grass, and through the process of oral tradition people added the grass (green or unstated) to make the story a bit more interesting.  Note that this would be really easy, even if the event was an entire fiction, because those would know that Passover was typically green so adding that flourish would be natural.  It's like adding snow to a Christmas story (in the US at least) even if the original story doesn't mention snow.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There was a story where there was grass (no color given) and that it was Passover, and Mark adds the color as a literary flourish and doesn't mention the time because it was not important for that story&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There was a story about sitting on the green grass, and John (or his source) adds the particular festival for theological reasons, that Mark didn't seem to have.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The McGrews seem to think that the "ur-source" is positing a specific text that exists, rather than a process which produces texts.  It is not the simplest idea to say that the events happened as stated, when we have other reasons to doubt them (e.g. miracles are unlikely) when we also have many known processes which could produce them, both with and without a separate text or oral tradition.  I could probably envision several other possibilities for this "coincidence", but the point seems to be,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We don't know the authors of any of the Gospels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We don't know the details of the process by which they got their information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We &lt;em&gt;do know&lt;/em&gt; that several of them had copies of at least some of the direct texts, in addition to who-knows how many other sources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We &lt;em&gt;do know&lt;/em&gt; that there is strong indication that some of the Gospel writing was included for &lt;em&gt;theological&lt;/em&gt;  or &lt;em&gt;literary&lt;/em&gt; reasons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The actual posited coincidences are pretty weak. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last point needs a bit of unpacking.  The rainy season is stated to go from October through April, which is more than half the year.  If you included a story that had green grass, you'd be correct about the "time of year" more than 50% of the time.  John, in his story, doesn't seem to mention Passover directly.  In John 2:13 he mentions "When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover" and then between that and the grass incident, we have phrases like (emphasis mine) John 3:22 "where he spent &lt;strong&gt;some time&lt;/strong&gt; with them".  Then John 5:1 "&lt;strong&gt;Some time later&lt;/strong&gt;, Jesus went up to Jerusalem for one of the Jewish festivals." then John 6:1 we have "&lt;strong&gt;Some time after this&lt;/strong&gt;," before the feeding.  So, for the McGrews if the "undesigned coincidence" works in their favor, they can say there is an overlap.   If it didn't, then it probably wouldn't be noticed.  But even if noticed, it can be plausibly denied given the lack of specificity in the time on both sides of the story.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone who is convinced by these two passages as an "undesigned coincidence" I would be skeptical of many of their claims.  I don't have time nor the expertise to go through each and every one of the so-called "coincidences", but they all strike me initially as being completely -- and trivially -- understood as being produced by a common process and are not strong evidence that the events actually happened.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A larger point also, is that even if there is agreement on the time of year, or even specifically a day of an event,  that doesn't mean that the events actually occurred on that day -- it only implies that the &lt;em&gt;story&lt;/em&gt; occurs on that day.  It makes sense that Passover would appear importantly in many stories, both real and fictional, so "coincidences" which tie a story to that day do not say much about whether they are true or not. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="religion"></category></entry><entry><title>Why do we need double-blind studies?</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2022/May/31/why-do-we-need-double-blind-studies/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-05-31T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2022-05-31T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2022-05-31:/posts/2022/May/31/why-do-we-need-double-blind-studies/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was recently reading some articles about &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2020/Jul/09/skepticism-and-dubious-medical-procedures/"&gt;dubious medical procedures&lt;/a&gt;, and the claims of miraculous healings.

I was struck by a level of credulity with some of these claims, but at the same time felt the emotional tug of a healing claim and some internal push-back on the insistence on double-blind studies.  I can understand how the people making the claim might balk at skepticism.  Why do we always need double-blind studies in medicine anyway?  Can't you do a procedure, especially if there is an obvious positive outcome (e.g. someone can walk who couldn't before, see when they were blind before, etc...), and see the outcome and not have to go through all of the hassle of making a double-blind study?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not being a medical doctor, I started to read about it.  I've learned a few interesting examples that I read &lt;a href="https://www.winchesterhospital.org/health-library/article?id=38405&amp;amp;utm_source=pocket_mylist"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One about the effectiveness of a surgical procedure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a particularly dramatic example of this phenomenon, consider what happened when orthopedic surgeon Bruce Moseley, team physician for the Houston Rockets, decided he needed to properly evaluate the efficacy of an operation commonly used to treat the pain caused by arthritic knees. This surgery involves scraping away rough areas in the knee's cartilage. It is widely believed to be effective, and as many as 400,000 such surgeries are performed each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mosely decided to see if the surgery really worked. He conducted a study in which five patients were given the real surgery and five were given fake surgery consisting of little incisions over the knee. He then followed his patients for two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results were amazing. Interviews showed that pain and swelling were reduced just as much in the placebo group as in the group that received the real surgery. Four out of the five participants who experienced the fake surgery said it was so helpful they'd gladly recommend it to a friend. Glowing testimonials, in other words, mean nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(the study is &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12110735/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another &lt;a href="https://bjui-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1464-410x.1998.00554.x"&gt;about prostate size&lt;/a&gt; (placebo gave the same improvements even after 2 years).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how does this happen?  The article points out (with references) common examples which include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_bias"&gt;Observer bias&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; -- the person doing the measurement inadvertently noticing where the effect is, or not, because they expect it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygmalion_effect"&gt;Rosenthal Effect&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (aka the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer-expectancy_effect"&gt;observer-expectancy effect&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;)-- the observer inadvertently influencing the participants actions, so they act in the way the observer expects.  this indirect communication can be remarkably subtle and effective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reinterpretation Effect&lt;/strong&gt; - when observers reinterpret the result after the fact, given the expectations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Placebo Effect&lt;/strong&gt; - when no-treatment gives a positive result.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory Distortion&lt;/strong&gt; - the observer's memory of results changes over time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Natural Course of the Disease: Illusion of Agency&lt;/strong&gt; - natural improvements can possible lead to misattributing the treatment effectiveness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Study Drop Outs&lt;/strong&gt; - participants with bad results may drop out of a study, leaving the good results remaining&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this list I'd add&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multiple treatments&lt;/strong&gt; -- if a participant gets multiple treatments simultaneously, the observer could misattribute the effectiveness of one of the treatments. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these problems are clearly possible with any of the miraculous healing claims &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2022/Mar/23/a-long-discussion-about-miracles/"&gt;I've read about and reviewed earlier&lt;/a&gt;.  In the presence of a community supporting faith-healings, you get observer bias, Rothenthal effects,  the illusion of agency, and placebo effects occuring.  When the reports come some time after the events, the memory distortion, reinterpretation effects, and multiple treatment effects.  Further, faith-healings have a massive drop-out problem -- many people are prayed for, and the people who don't get healed don't step forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you make sure that the treatment you are studying actually works?  You have to rule out each of these effects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keep all of the participants (rules put drop-out effects)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keep accurate pre-post observations (rules out reinterpretation and memory distortion effects)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use placebo control groups (rules out natural course)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keep all parties blind to the treatment and placebo groups (rules out observer and Rosenthal effects)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keep all treatments narrow and quantitative (rules out multiple treatment and memory distortion) &lt;/li&gt;

I've &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/search.html?q=miracles"&gt;written about miracles a number of times&lt;/a&gt;, but there always seems to something new to say.  In this episode, the skeptic is Michael Shermer whose approach by and large I don't like.  I find he isn't very direct, has long explanations and stories -- which is inefficient in this format -- and many of his responses are not actually relevant.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theists presented two main specific miracle claims:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pqj2i9gb8U&amp;amp;t=1s"&gt;Bruce Van Natta&lt;/a&gt; who had a truck fall on him, destroying much of his intestine, but shortly after prayer his intestine miraculously regrew.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0QtFCpFg9I"&gt;Chris Gunderson&lt;/a&gt; who was born with an incurable disorder called Chronic Pseudo Obstruction Syndrome, which was cured by prayer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and then they referred to the Heidi Baker ministries work in Mozambique healing many.  You can read about it in the &lt;a href="https://pcpj2.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/study_of_the_therapeutic_effects_of_proximal-5.pdf"&gt;journal article here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite my attempts, I can't find medical journal descriptions of the two cases for Van Natta and Gunderson.  However, I did find the original study on the work of Heidi Baker, but I had already &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2020/Jul/09/skepticism-and-dubious-medical-procedures/"&gt;responded to that source and those claims elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;. TLDR -- the study has serious problems and is unconvincing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's another way to put it.  What would we expect in a universe that is complex, that we understand reasonably well but with significant gaps in our understanding, but that we also tend to understand better over time?  What would we expect if there really is an agent that answers some requests, and has the ability to do truly miraculous things?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's the same sort of question one asks about alien abductions.  What would we expect in a universe where the aliens aren't here, and our own understanding and tech increases in time, vs if the aliens are here from time to time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both of these cases, we'd expect the situation without external agencies to be a smattering of weird cases that remain unexplained currently, but with no obvious pattern to them.  We'd also expect that we'd get &lt;em&gt;fewer&lt;/em&gt; of these cases (normalizing to population number and rate of information spread) over time. We'd expect geographical areas that have less access to our best understanding and technology to have more of these cases.  We'd expect that the more skeptical we look at the claims, the more closely we look at the evidence, that the evidence for the claims tends to evaporate.  It is no coincidence that UFO claims have gone down as we've put a camera in everyone's pocket.  This is the hallmark of a false claim.  The same occurs with miracle claims -- they have every hallmark of a false claim. The smattering of currently unexplained miracle claims lack available evidence to inspect, show no real pattern, and are against a backdrop of claims that have been debunked.   These miracle claims are also against a backdrop of nearly universal prayer across the population, with little to no effect.  Finally, where I have been able to find the evidence, the actual strength of the evidence on the ground is profoundly weak.  In all other cases, I have not been able to even find the evidence -- only the claims.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This backdrop of failed prayer and debunked miracle claims highlight the fact that miracle &lt;em&gt;claims&lt;/em&gt; are likely to be false, lowering their prior probability.  If prayer were a new claimed medical procedure, no one would take it seriously with such a false claim and negative result rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the guests, Craig Keener, stated that Heidi's Baker's miracles were happening regularly, yet none of the guests seemed willing to address why that might not be happening in a country with the technology able to discern false from true effects?  The single study they quoted is riddled with problems, and you'd think they'd want to perform a more detailed study here.  They claimed that miracles are hard to study, because miracles are rare events and can't be predicted ahead of time, but that seems a convenient excuse -- and not always the case, if Heidi Baker is to be believed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Craig Keener also hinted that there &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; a pattern to the miracles, but didn't come out and say what he was strongly suggesting, that Christian miracles were the ones that were mostly happening.  Any pattern that Keener might have been hinting at would be testable!  It certainly would go a long way to supporting the veracity of miracle claims if you could specify a pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find myself still unconvinced by the few claims, with little pattern or evidence, but perhaps as our understanding grows we'll get more confirmed cases, as we would expect for a true effect.  My bet is that these claims will continue to be in retreat just as the UFOs seem to have left us as our ability to detect them has increased.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="religion"></category><category term="unbelievable"></category></entry><entry><title>Bad Apologetics</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2022/Jan/18/bad-apologetics/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-01-18T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-01-18T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2022-01-18:/posts/2022/Jan/18/bad-apologetics/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;Unbelievable&lt;/em&gt; podcast episode &lt;a href="https://www.premierchristianradio.com/Shows/Saturday/Unbelievable/Episodes/Unbelievable-Do-extraordinary-claims-require-extraordinary-evidence-Jonathan-McLatchie-vs-Jonathan-Pearce"&gt;Do extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence?

Jonathan McLatchie vs Jonathan Pearce&lt;/a&gt; I was struck by several claims and points, especially made by Jonathan McLatchie.   I went back and listened to two other debates with him, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/a-wIaCRIdOA"&gt;one with Matt Dillahunty&lt;/a&gt;  and &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2020/May/29/jonathan-and-brian-in-conversation/"&gt;one with myself&lt;/a&gt; and found some of the points Pearce made against McLatchie were things that both I and Matt had brought up -- mostly about McLatchie's apparent over-fondness for stories over real evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bayes-factors-and-confidence"&gt;Bayes Factors and Confidence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonathan McLatchie talks about cumulative cases, using the vocabulary of probability theory, such as,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have two pieces of evidence each with a base factor of 10 and then combined they have a cumulative base factor of 100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He thinks in terms of &lt;em&gt;independent&lt;/em&gt; data pushing the likelihoods up and down so that once you've used one data point to update the likelihoods, you can start with that updated likelihood with the next data point -- ignoring any possible dependency between one data point and another.  As we see below, it also ignores priors. This makes the process easy, but it leads to false positives which can be seen in a trivial example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in my book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2019/Jan/14/stats-for-everyone/"&gt;Statistical Inference for Everyone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, I use an example of drawing cards from a deck of (unusual) cards and trying to infer which deck.  At some point we have drawn a number of 9's (with replacement) in a row, and are trying to infer whether the deck is a so-called High deck (which has 10 10's, 9 9's, 8 8's, ... , 2 2's and 1 A ), a so-called Low deck (which has  1 10, 2 9's, ... , and 10 A's), and a so-called Nines deck (which has all 9's).  The Nines deck is a-priori a lot less probable, because we were simply told that there were two decks -- High and Low.  However, after many draws of 9 in a row that claim seems less likely.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://bblais.github.io/images/Pasted image 20220118061447.png" width=80% align=center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Bayes factors alone, the data would only support the Nines deck and miss the actual (correct) inference.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another problem with ignoring priors is that it commits you to believe many other crazy claims and would lead you to &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2010/Aug/28/the-non-psychic-octopus/"&gt;believe in psychic octopuses&lt;/a&gt;.  I made this point with McLatchie and so did Matt Dillahunty -- if you have a flawed epistemology then you will be forced to either believe in crazy things or be inconsistent and hypocritical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rarity-of-miracles-is-evidence-against-them"&gt;Rarity of Miracles is Evidence Against Them&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McLatchie states, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hypothesis that God has used miracles as authenticating signs predicts that they will stand out against the normal course of nature.  The fact that miracles do in fact stand out against nature cannot be taken as evidence against miracles because the hypothesis predicts very strongly that's what you'll find.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What McLatchie doesn't seem to see is that &lt;em&gt;regardless of the source&lt;/em&gt; any purported cause of an event which is rare &lt;em&gt;has a low prior&lt;/em&gt;, which should be used against it when comparing to other causes with higher priors.  Since God is supposedly using miracles as "authenticating signs", if you are going to interpret any particular event as a miracle you have to overcome the low prior -- "authenticating signs" would be rare -- support it with stronger evidence than would be needed for a more mundane explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would further ask McLatchie, why should authenticating signs be rare in the first place?  Why couldn't God make a miracle like his name written in the clouds every time the sun comes up, to authenticate his existence and power?  Also, would McLatchie have to be making arguments like this if God were a lot more obvious?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-prophecy-of-passover"&gt;The Prophecy of Passover&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one that really perplexes me is Jonathan's perspective on the prophecy that Jesus would be executed on Passover (or around Passover, depending on which Gospel you read).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;another example would be that jesus death coincides with the feast of passover so jesus dies [on Passover or around Passover] according to all four gospels [...] so jesus in the new testament is presented and portrayed as the fulfillment of that passover lamb that he is the ultimate passover lamb that the passover feasts pointed to and so it's quite a coincidence  it's quite fitting then that jesus death coincides with the feast of passover that's the strength [...]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are very good &lt;em&gt;story-reasons&lt;/em&gt; for having this be the case, the authors of the Gospels &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; the Old Testament stories, and could interpret the Jesus story in light of them and write the story accordingly.  This is so straightforward an explanation, with very little to counter it -- even if you believe the writers to be eye-witnesses.  All you'd need is for Jesus to be executed sometime in the vicinity of Passover, a short time of an oral tradition or retelling of the stories by the same people (which get naturally embellished) and you've got it.  McLatchie's argument is so uncompelling for anyone who isn't already convinced that it is remarkable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="undesigned-coincidences"&gt;Undesigned Coincidences&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another argument made by McLatchie is the supposed use of "undesigned coincidences" in the text.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="https://jonathanmclatchie.com/yes-richard-carrier-there-are-undesigned-coincidences-part-1/"&gt;one of his responses to Richard Carrier&lt;/a&gt;, McLatchie writes,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the most classic form (which Carrier is attempting to define) is when you have multiple (at least two) accounts that report an event where one account answers in passing a natural question raised incidentally by the other. Contrary to what Carrier asserts, the argument has never been that such features &lt;em&gt;prove&lt;/em&gt; there was a real story. Rather, such features are &lt;em&gt;evidence&lt;/em&gt; that a real event lies behind the reports found in the gospels — that is to say, the presence of an undesigned coincidence is more probable given the hypothesis of historicism than given the annulment of that hypothesis. Some undesigned coincidences contribute greater evidence than others. Carrier’s lack of nuance in his description of the basic argument does not get his article off to the best start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think my biggest problem with this line of thinking is that there are &lt;em&gt;major&lt;/em&gt; differences between the narratives in the Gospels.  For example, the nativity narratives are contradictory -- just try to map out the path Jesus' parents take.   The resurrection narratives too do not agree with each other, like the number of people coming and going, whether things were open or closed, or who actually saw Jesus.  When apologists have to make arguments (i.e. the text is not clear) to justify seeming discrepancies in large events, why should we pay attention to &lt;em&gt;subtle&lt;/em&gt; agreements?  Why should we be surprised that there are some agreements, when we know that there are literary and other source dependencies between the anonymous writings of the Gospels?  Again, McLatchie's argument is so uncompelling for anyone who isn't already convinced that it is remarkable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lack-of-priors"&gt;Lack of Priors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is striking how many recent apologists use Bayesian reasoning yet ignore the prior -- which means they really aren't using Bayesian reasoning but want to just &lt;em&gt;sound&lt;/em&gt; like they are.  This is a form of dishonesty, I feel, but at best it is a clumsy analysis -- and a problem that has been pointed out &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2021/Aug/29/bad-apologetics-ep-18-bayes-machine-goes-brrrrrrrrr/"&gt;for the McGrews&lt;/a&gt;, Calum Miller &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Jul/11/unbelievable-project-the-probability-of-the-resurrection/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/DRNIXn1xD_0"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2015/Aug/10/deduction-induction-and-abduction-oh-my/"&gt;Blake Giunta&lt;/a&gt;, and of course &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2020/May/29/jonathan-and-brian-in-conversation/"&gt;mentioned in my conversation with Jonathan McLatchie&lt;/a&gt;.    The use of Bayes Factors, which also ignores priors, is indicative of this approach. Why do apologists want to ignore priors?  Because what they are arguing for is, a-priori, seriously unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="religion"></category></entry><entry><title>Proton Decay and the Resurrection of Jesus</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2022/Jan/17/proton-decay-and-the-resurrection-of-jesus/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-01-17T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-01-17T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2022-01-17:/posts/2022/Jan/17/proton-decay-and-the-resurrection-of-jesus/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;Unbelievable&lt;/em&gt; podcast episode &lt;a href="https://www.premierchristianradio.com/Shows/Saturday/Unbelievable/Episodes/Unbelievable-Do-extraordinary-claims-require-extraordinary-evidence-Jonathan-McLatchie-vs-Jonathan-Pearce"&gt;Do extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence?

&lt;h2 id="proton-decay-and-rare-events"&gt;Proton Decay and Rare Events&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McLatchie says that the frequency with which we experience something is not always a good guide to its probability.  Although I'd suggest that it is &lt;em&gt;usually&lt;/em&gt; a very good guide, let's look at his example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McLatchie says &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_decay"&gt;proton decay&lt;/a&gt; has not been observed, but is predicted by most (if not all) grand unified theories of particle physics so frequency is not a good guide for prior probability.   He comments that the difference between a rare event that has a low prior vs one with a high prior, like that for proton decay, is that proton decay has a &lt;em&gt;theoretical underpinning&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it's not that this is just a random guess even though there's no precedent&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, he feels, the resurrection has no  precedent but also has a theoretical underpinning.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...] frequency  isn't the most helpful metric for assessing the prior probability you also want to look for whether there's a theoretical underpinning for this hypothesis and likewise with the case for christianity the case for the resurrection in particular i think that you can make a similar case from a theoretical underpinning a background information that stands independently of the extent to which there is precedence in our experience of the miraculous [...]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comparison is laughable to me, given the differences in the "theoretical underpinning" of each, but let's see how the comparison plays out.  The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model"&gt;Standard Model&lt;/a&gt; predicts that proton decay will not happen -- that it violates a conservation law --  however many models that build off of the Standard Model do include proton decay.   Given the state of affairs, I'm not sure if scientists put a large prior on proton decay anyway, but let's grant that -- say, we are reasonably confident that proton decay will occur.  What theoretical underpinning would we have to give us this confidence?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many times that science has predicted rare and unprecedented events or effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the motion of the Earth through the Ether (e.g. Michaelson-Morely experiment)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the bending of star light by a massive object (e.g. Einsteins GR prediction)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;civilizations on Mars (e.g. Lowell's canals)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the existence of the Higgs Boson (1967 work by many scientists, including &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/510036a"&gt;one of my former instructors, Gerry Guralnik&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;proton decay (predicted by many Grand Unified theories)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that several of these were not confirmed, yet at the time there were good reasons to think they were true.  Whenever science has predicted a rare, unprecedented event there have been common patterns.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the novel theory is consistent with &lt;em&gt;every other&lt;/em&gt; confirmed prediction from the other theories.  For example General Relativity describes gravity, predicts novel phenomena, but can be shown in certain limits to be consistent with Newton's Law of Gravity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the novel theory predicts &lt;em&gt;specific limits&lt;/em&gt; on the novel phenomena.  For example, General Relativity predicts the exact angle that starlight will bend passing by the known mass of the Sun, and specifically how accurately the measurements need to be made.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ones confidence in a novel theory's prediction, before the prediction is confirmed, comes down to how &lt;em&gt;much the other predictions of the novel theory have been confirmed&lt;/em&gt; -- especially if the theory has made several striking confirmed predictions.  For example, scientists were confident in the existence of gravity waves for a long time before they were observed, because General Relativity had passed every test to an accuracy as good as we could measure, and many of those tests were profoundly unintuitive and unexpected.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can be confident in the prediction of proton decay in as much as those theories that predict it have been confirmed to a great degree on other terms.  For example, &lt;a href="https://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/PT.3.2223"&gt;"the standard model predicts the electron magnetic moment to an astonishing accuracy of one part in a trillion."&lt;/a&gt;  The Standard Model is also consistent with every other theory within its domain, and doesn't violate any outside of its domain (the role of gravity, for example, is outside the Standard Model).  Grand unified theories all have to be as accurate as the Standard Model to be considered.  It is these factors that make us confident in the prediction of novel phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does the "theoretical underpinning" of the God-theory for the Resurrection stack up?  The things that McLatchie brings up are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keener's book of Miracles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is merit to Lewis trilemma (i.e. Liar, Lunatic, Lord)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;multi-sensory experiences, with groups, around the Resurrection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;prophecy such as Christianity becoming a global religion, predicted in the Old Testament&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus executed on/around passover, predicted in the Old Testament&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The episode dealt with these topics pretty well, and I've written a bit about some of them, including &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/May/21/a-little-about-miracles/"&gt;miracles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Mar/18/unbelievable-project-miracles-and-healing-is-it-evidence-for-the-truth-of-christianity/"&gt;healings&lt;/a&gt;,  and &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2020/May/29/jonathan-and-brian-in-conversation/"&gt;my conversation with Jonathan McLatchie&lt;/a&gt;.  But simply compare the theories around proton decay and those of the Resurrection.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one is consistent with &lt;em&gt;every other&lt;/em&gt; confirmed prediction from the other theories -- the other isn't.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one predicts &lt;em&gt;specific limits&lt;/em&gt; on the novel phenomena, including time frames and what &lt;em&gt;specific&lt;/em&gt; steps we'd need to confirm it  -- the other doesn't.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one has a pile of other novel &lt;em&gt;specific&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;quantitative&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;predictions&lt;/strong&gt; that have since been confirmed -- the other doesn't.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I want to ask Jonathan McLatchie a few questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you make a &lt;strong&gt;prediction&lt;/strong&gt; of when miraculous healing, or any other miracles, will happen -- or is it always post-hoc?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you make any description of a measurement that could be done, no matter how impractical, for directly confirming any of the &lt;strong&gt;predictions&lt;/strong&gt; from the God-theory?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You mentioned a case of a healing of Irene McDonald with multiple sclerosis, but I can't find the medical details (i.e. the actual doctor's reports, the detailed timeline, etc...).  Same with the case of Barbara Schnyder.  Can you provide those? (note -- some of your other medical miracle claims were &lt;a href="http://localhost:8000/posts/2020/Jul/09/skepticism-and-dubious-medical-procedures/"&gt;suspect after I researched them&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How did you determine that these people were healed &lt;em&gt;by prayer&lt;/em&gt; and also &lt;em&gt;by God&lt;/em&gt;?  You can't answer "because they prayed and she was healed after" (post-hoc fallacy) and you can't answer "because they prayed to the Christian God", because some other God may have answered, or some other thing.  You have to, in your explanation, be able to distinguish from the prayers that haven't worked, the cases where healing happened without prayer or with prayer to another God.  Without this, you can't make a reasonable claim that God-did-it.&lt;/li&gt;

This let's me know that I understand completely what is being  written and in many cases allows me to extend and debug my own tools.

&lt;p&gt;which we can find by looking at the end of the array for each of those variables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;sim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;plot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I discovered that by originally doing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methodological naturalism&lt;/em&gt; is the only choice we have available, because no one has demonstrated any procedure to distinguish supernatural claims. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To assume a naturalistic explanation in the future is simply the recognition that in &lt;em&gt;every single case&lt;/em&gt; where we have finally understood a topic, the best explanation has &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; turned out to be supernatural...&lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"bit like someone using a metal detector to [...] look for valuable natural resources such as gold, silver or gems, only finding valuable metals, and then concluding that therefore it is unlikely that there are nonmetal valuable resources in that mine, "&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've heard this analogy before, and I think it is worth responding to because on the face it does seem reasonable.  The second you restrict the target of a search, then it shouldn't be surprising that you don't find certain things, right?  As with all analogies, one has to make sure that the relevant components are considered.  Let me see if I can use the metal detector analogy to convey my original statement better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're on a beach, and other than sand, there are objects we might discover buried there. I note that there are some metal objects, and build a metal detector.  At first my metal detector is not terrific -- it can only find large objects -- but I keep improving it over the years to find smaller and smaller objects.  Now, my friend says that he sees plastic objects that I can't detect with my detector.  "Yay!" I say, and ask him for his plastic detector.  He doesn't have one.  He has provided no way to detect plastic, but says that he can see it.  "See that lump over there, it's hiding a plastic object".  I go over with my metal detector, and find that the lump is caused by a metal object.  He keeps doing this, pointing this way and that, and I keep detecting metal, and he continues to provide no method for detecting plastic despite his claims.  Further, every claim of a plastic object turns out to be metal.  Sometimes it takes a while -- the object is made of some unknown material, my friend insists it's plastic, and it turns out to be metal anyway.   This goes on for years and years.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if someone on the beach produces some unknown object, what are the chances that it is plastic?  How would you know?  If you were forced to bet, what bet would you do -- metal or plastic?  &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="religion"></category></entry><entry><title>Convert mp3 files to audiobook for Apple Books</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2021/May/17/convert-mp3-files-to-audiobook-for-apple-books/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-05-17T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2021-05-17T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2021-05-17:/posts/2021/May/17/convert-mp3-files-to-audiobook-for-apple-books/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Mac/iPhone Books app has some issues.

Before switching the content out of iTunes into a separate app, audiobooks were housed in the same app as music.  You could edit the metadata on individual tracks, you could easily import an audiobook cd and just change the type to "Audiobook" and things would work.  If something was wrong with the title of a track, or the track number, you could go in and edit it.  Once they switched to Books, this level of editing was no longer possible.  Until recently I was doing the tedious task of editing in Music, copying to Books, seeing errors, copying back etc...  The errors were often things like Books breaking the audiobook into separate "books" because the track numbers weren't read right, or the tracks would be out of order, or the artwork wouldn't come through.  I was ok with this workaround tedium until recently, when I wanted to start following a youtube channel called &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy63pdWnpupE8MfxpMNfRNg"&gt;Digital Gnosis&lt;/a&gt;.  One of my favorite playlists is called &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLggkCqSR7N1eq3UGURGKs9hcJNV-uIn4n"&gt;Bad Apologetics&lt;/a&gt;, with 15 episodes so far with an average length &lt;strong&gt;around 7 and a half hours a piece&lt;/strong&gt;!  So this state of affairs has forced me to retool my workflow, because I can't be at my computer to watch a 9 hour video, and I don't want to pay youtube to be able to listen while my phone is locked, and there are too many videos/playlists to deal with by hand.  So here goes my solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="make-a-folder-of-mp3-files"&gt;Make a folder of mp3 files&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the tool youtube-dl, installed with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;pip install youtube-dl --upgrade
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we download all of the videos in a playlist, convert to mp3, and put them in the current folder.  This playlist is called Open Conversations, so I put it in a folder named for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;youtube-dl -i --extract-audio --audio-format mp3 &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLggkCqSR7N1dBxUjy51NdVGPJ78JXEdl-&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One can also do this by importing audiobook CDs and place the tracks in a folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="get-the-book-info-correct"&gt;Get the book info correct&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We continue with a script to get the track titles correct.  This part is a little manual, because the naming scheme for the tracks are individual to the playlist.  A little bit of string magic does the trick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;glob&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;glob&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;folder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Open Conversations&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;fnames&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;sorted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;glob&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;folder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;/*.mp3&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fnames&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; Having the album name in the track title, followed by " - " and the track name seems to be important for the Books app to get the title and tracks right for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;

Since then I migrated it using &lt;a href="https://nbdev.fast.ai"&gt;nbdev&lt;/a&gt; to experiment with using jupyter notebooks as the basis for making packages, yielding &lt;a href="https://github.com/bblais/pyndamics3"&gt;pyndamics3&lt;/a&gt;.  I added MCMC support for parameter fitting fairly early, using PyMC, but changed to &lt;a href="https://emcee.readthedocs.io/en/stable/"&gt;emcee&lt;/a&gt; to have an all-python implementation.  (This past month, after upgrading to Big Sur on my Mac, I've been struggling to even install PyMC3 and pystan due to dependencies but that is another story).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, it struck me that the &lt;a href="https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/"&gt;lmfit&lt;/a&gt; package might be a straightforward way to add some curve fitting that would work with simpler systems, and take less time than running MCMC.  So, now &lt;a href="https://github.com/bblais/pyndamics3"&gt;pyndamics3&lt;/a&gt; can use &lt;a href="https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/"&gt;lmfit&lt;/a&gt; as a fitting backend.  For example, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="fitting-linear-growth"&gt;fitting linear growth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pylab&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;inline&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;pyndamics3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Simulation&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;21&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;28&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;35&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;42&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;49&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;56&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;63&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;70&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;77&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;84&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

Jonathan then told me two: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Case report of instantaneous resolution of juvenile macular degeneration blindness after proximal intercessory prayer”, Clarissa Romez, Kenn Freedman, David Zaritzky, Joshua W. Brown. &lt;em&gt;Explore&lt;/em&gt;. Available online 28 February 2020 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550830720300926&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Case Report of gastroparesis healing: 16 years of a chronic syndrome resolved after proximal intercessory prayer”,Clarissa Romeza, David Zaritzky, Joshua W. Brown. &lt;em&gt;Complementary Therapies in Medicine&lt;/em&gt;. Volume 43, April 2019, Pages 289-294.  https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965229918313116 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when I looked at this, I kept finding those two and a third, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Study of the Therapeutic Effects of Proximal Intercessory Prayer (STEPP) on Auditory and Visual Impairments in Rural Mozambique”, Candy Gunther Brown, Stephen C Mory, Rebecca Williams, Michael J McClymond.  &lt;em&gt;South Med J&lt;/em&gt;. 2010 Sep;103(9):864-9 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20686441/&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These three kept popping up again and again.  The journals have dubious standards, and the authors work for the same institution (https://www.globalmri.org/about).  On their website there is the following request: “We’re always looking for new testimonies. Do you have a testimony that is medically verified?”.  Could you imagine a similar claim written about, say, a homeopathic remedy for cancer?  If you took our remedy, and improved, we want to hear from you.  Otherwise, not.  Regardless of the contents of the specific studies, this sort of fishing for positive results is thoroughly unscientific and casts significant doubt on any results from this institution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My suspicions were confirmed going to http://sciencebasedmedicine.org (a great resource) where they have an article about the 3rd study in the list above:  https://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/proximal-intercessory-prayer/  Bottom line, this study has numerous, basic scientific problems with it and the results cannot be trusted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find that argument that a deity is better able to heal when the person asking them to do so is physically close to the person they are praying for absurd, lame, and convenient. It is a nice excuse to unblind the protocol, and nothing else –  a way of generating false-positive results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the process for collecting subjects used by these authors and supported by their institution,  in addition to their experimental design, is constructed with the sole purpose of bypassing the methods of science.  I was particularly surprised when I dug into the first study, went into their supplemental information, and saw a nice timeline of events (&lt;strong&gt;emphasis mine&lt;/strong&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[…]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;June 14 1960  Complete Neurological Examination Completely normal except for macular degeneration “cause undetermined”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1971 Examination confirms “ legal blindness” Recording of Visual Acuities - are consistent with legal blindness. No glasses recommended.  Degeneration and scaring (sic) of macula in both eyes &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1971-1974 Record of a series of Visual Acuities Visual Acuities consistent with legal blindness until record of 1974  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1/29/71  Visual Acuity  Right Eye- Finger Count  Left Eye - Hand motion- All without glasses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1-18-72  Right Eye - Hand Motion,  Left Eye - Hand Motion &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6-14-74 Right Eye - 20/100-1 Left Eye - 20/100-2  All (above) without glasses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1972 Learned to use a cane and read braille.  Blind Services: orientation and mobility skills and braille reading  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;02/18/1972-05/18/1972: Patient reports going through a Training Center to learn to walk with a cane and read braille. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**1972   August Vision restored through PIP **&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 4, 2001 Complete Eye Examination&lt;/strong&gt; VA 20/40 OD, 20/40-2 OS Corrected VA 20/40 OU None recorded Visual Acuity 20/40, 20/40-2.  Glasses -0.25 OD, -0.50 OS Normal eye exam except for evidence of dry eye early cataract changes. Optic nerves and maculae recorded as normal but also states + RPE dropout in macula OU.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;October 16, 2001  Return Visit. Treatment for Dry Eyes Provided&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;October 3, 2012.  Cataract surgery of right eye&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Etc…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the time between the prayer and the eye exam is…29 years!  This is “instantaneous resolution”?  Essentially, we’re taking this patient's word that their eyesight improved after prayer, but the authors (or anyone else) didn’t bother to test it for nearly 30 years.  This level of incompetence, poor design, and digging for positive results is staggering.  This is not the way one confirms medical claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second study seems at least a bit better, but with no controls, and knowing that the authors have a history of ludicrously bad design leaves me unconvinced.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I have tried to convey here is the process for investigating claims.  You look at the originals, you examine methods and possible ways the authors could have (deliberately or not) biased the results.  This is why we have blinding processes for medical experiments, and controls.  Otherwise you can always fall victim to false positives and rare one-off events.  We know that medical conditions can mysteriously improve (biology is complex and not entirely understood), so if you want to show your method of treatment actually works you do need to follow reasonable, skeptical procedures established by science.  It's certainly hard to do this, takes more time and work, but there is good reason why we trust science.  The lazy procedures of these authors -- including a self-proclaimed fishing for positive results -- is at best a cop-out and at worst a dishonest attempt to peddle bogus treatments.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="religion"></category></entry><entry><title>Something Satisfying About Building Pelican Themes</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2020/Jul/03/something-satisfying-about-building-pelican-themes/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-07-03T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-07-03T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2020-07-03:/posts/2020/Jul/03/something-satisfying-about-building-pelican-themes/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/"&gt;Pelican is a Python package&lt;/a&gt; for developing static websites.

I started out my blog with Wordpress and then toyed with Wix and Weebly.  But I found I didn't like the idea of a company holding my content -- if that company suddenly started to charge for the services, or disappeared altogether I didn't want my information caught in the middle.  I also liked the control that a static site builder, like &lt;a href="https://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; gives you.  Finally, I like working in &lt;a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax"&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt; for my blog content (and most of my other content as well).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of &lt;a href="http://pelicanthemes.com"&gt;themes for Pelican&lt;/a&gt; to choose from, and although I have &lt;a href="https://elegant.oncrashreboot.com"&gt;used some before&lt;/a&gt; I find them looking a little dated.  So for the past few designs of this website what I've done is head over to &lt;a href="https://colorlib.com/wp/templates/"&gt;Colorlibs Free Web Templates&lt;/a&gt; and find a template that looks good, like &lt;a href="https://colorlib.com/wp/template/elen/"&gt;Elen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://colorlib.com/wp/template/miniblog/"&gt;Miniblog&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://colorlib.com/wp/template/philosophy/"&gt;Philosophy&lt;/a&gt;.  For good measure, get a pelican theme to help with comparisons, something like &lt;a href="https://github.com/kdeldycke/plumage"&gt;Plummage&lt;/a&gt;.  Make sure to have the &lt;a href="https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/themes.html"&gt;Creating Pelican Themes&lt;/a&gt; site handy!  After that, it's pretty straightforward to port the web template over to a pelican theme -- but I still do a lot of trial and error! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the satisfying parts of the developing a Pelican theme is to see years of articles instantly look like new.  For example, in the &lt;a href="https://colorlib.com/wp/template/philosophy/"&gt;Philosophy&lt;/a&gt; template &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; there is this snippet which presents the summary of a blog article,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;article&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;masonry__brick entry format-standard&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;data-aos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;fade-up&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;entry__thumb&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;single-standard.html&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;entry__thumb-link&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is repeated once for many different articles, making for a long &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; file.  In the pelican theme, the &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; loops over all of the articles and generates this long list using &lt;a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/"&gt;Jinja&lt;/a&gt; syntax,&lt;/p&gt;

{% endfor %}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice the injection of Python here: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a loop to generate the html&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;variables, like &lt;code&gt;article.date&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;article.category&lt;/code&gt;, to put in article-specific information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if-statements to include option content, like subtitles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if-statements to include default behavior, in case no image is given for example&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This provides a level of control that is hard to match.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make the theme, as shown in the docs, you need to just make the following files&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;  ├── static
  │   ├── css
  │   └── images
  └── templates
      ├── archives.html         // to display archives
      ├── period_archives.html  // to display time-period archives
      ├── article.html          // processed for each article
      ├── author.html           // processed for each author
      ├── authors.html          // must list all the authors
      ├── categories.html       // must list all the categories
      ├── category.html         // processed for each category
      ├── index.html            // the index (list all the articles)
      ├── page.html             // processed for each page
      ├── tag.html              // processed for each tag
      └── tags.html             // must list all the tags. Can be a tag cloud.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting from the free web template, I break off the parts that are included in all of the files and put it in &lt;code&gt;base.html&lt;/code&gt;, copying the &lt;a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/"&gt;Jinja&lt;/a&gt; parts from a pelican theme.  Like,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;html&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;no-js&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;lang&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;en&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which you can compare to the first and last parts of the &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; of the &lt;a href="https://colorlib.com/wp/template/philosophy/"&gt;Philosophy&lt;/a&gt; template.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me about a week to iron out most of the nits to get the final version, but the process was just fun.  There is something really satisfying about constructing something like a website by scripting.   Every time I learn something new.  One thing was to include &lt;code&gt;{% block extra_css %}{% endblock %}&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;{% block extra_js %}{% endblock %}&lt;/code&gt; allowing some of the pages to include specific css and js files, which was instrumental in getting the tipue search working.  &lt;/p&gt;

We explore the structure of Bayes, when it can be used in non-quantitative applications, and why it is so important.  We cover the Monty Hall problem, the medical testing problem, the connection to Occam's Razor, and other topics.&lt;/p&gt;

The conversation goes beyond that and touches on the question of whether we should be accepting of personal testimony for strange single occurrence events as well as a bit of biology.

&lt;p&gt;The first two solutions seem to have a lot of repetition, and two variables for every one I want to save. The last one seems a bit ugly, and forces me to remember to have an index variable (enumerate or counter), and won't work if I don't know the sizes ahead of time.  I’d love to know if there is a standard solution to this common pattern.   Here’s one that I came up with, which I don’t think it optimum but at least solves the immediate problem.  Defining a Storage class,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Storage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="fm"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="fm"&gt;__add__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;other&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Storage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;other&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="fm"&gt;__iadd__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;other&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;other&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;arg&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;arg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;zip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)):&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="n"&gt;ret&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;tuple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ret&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ret&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ret&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__array__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;numpy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;vstack&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can rewrite the above SIR model with &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;R&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;β&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;γ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.1&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;dt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.01&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Storage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;R&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;dS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;β&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dt&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;R&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dR&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;R&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;plot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the parameter exploration example with,&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;param&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

Michael Straczynski&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href="http://www.jmsnews.com/"&gt;jms&lt;/a&gt;) has had on me.  My first introduction to him was in the TV series &lt;a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylon_5"&gt;Babylon 5&lt;/a&gt; in the 1990's while I was in graduate school.  The series connected with me on many levels including the attention to correct physics, story telling with actual consequences for the characters, a respect for multiple philosophies of life, and a planned story arc (decades before Game of Thrones).  In his own words, "As much as B5 was about exploration , wars, and the rise and fall of empires, at its center were issues of personal choice, the consequences that result from those choices, and our willingness to accept responsibility for those consequences." Since then I have followed him through World War Z, Thor, and Sense 8 as well as his excellent Screenwriting book but Babylon 5 is something I keep returning to.  It's like returning home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading his autobiography, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Becoming-Superman-Journey-Poverty-Hollywood/dp/0062857843"&gt;Becoming Superman&lt;/a&gt;, I was again struck by the life lessons he communicates through his personal story.  If there was a person set up to be a total failure it would be &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Michael_Straczynski"&gt;J. Michael Straczynski&lt;/a&gt;.  His description of his childhood reads like a manual for how to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; raise children.  Each time the reader thinks it can't get any worse --- it does.  It was was Straczynski's single-minded pursuit to be the &lt;em&gt;opposite&lt;/em&gt; of his parents and be more like Superman that saved him from an almost inevitable disaster.  Through his example, jms communicates clear positive messages.  Be true to yourself, communicate only truth to others, stand up for the misfortunes of anyone, never compromise your principles even at personal expense and realize that you can choose differently than your past might set you up for.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't recommend this book more.  It reads as a mystery novel, an inspirational self-help book, and a devotional reading to the process of writing and life all rolled into one. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="articles"></category></entry><entry><title>Unbelievable?

Travis is the author of "Stand Firm: Apologetics and the Brilliance of the Gospel" and says that both Christians and atheists often adopt a faulty definition of faith. He makes the case that faith is less about beliefs, and more about ventured trust on the basis of evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I make the case that the term &lt;em&gt;faith&lt;/em&gt; is poorly defined, and if it means the same as &lt;em&gt;trust&lt;/em&gt; then we should just use that word. I speak about probability theory as the structure of epistemology, and stress scientific thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

This book explores the role of rational thought as described by the rules of probability applied to the ideas in traditional religious discourse. It provides a basic introduction to the rules of probability for those who want a refresher and then proceeds to apply those rules to standard arguments for the existence of God, the resurrection of Jesus, the evidence for miracles, and the concept of faith. Through this exploration, a common thread of analysis is woven to describe notions of simplicity in explanations, independence of evidence, and the common cognitive biases we all share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I envision this book to be a living document that I update as I expand topics, clarify the topics I have covered, and improve the examples.  Please let me know if you find any omissions, typos, errors, etc... as well as any suggestions for further work!&lt;/p&gt;

Then &lt;a href="https://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/etj.html"&gt;E. T. Jaynes&lt;/a&gt; showed me that probability forms the foundation of rationality itself.  Remarkably very few axioms are needed to constrain the mathematical forms necessary for rational thought and the outcome turns out to be &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Simon_Laplace#Analytic_theory_of_probabilities"&gt;Laplace's original formulation&lt;/a&gt;.  What follows are the axioms so that you can appreciate them as much as I.  The paper &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://bayes.wustl.edu/gregory/articles.pdf"&gt;From Laplace to Supernova SN1987A: Bayesian Inference In Astrophysics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; by Tom Loredo is an excellent and complete guide to this, including quantitative examples.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jaynes prefers the word &lt;em&gt;desiderata&lt;/em&gt; for this list - a collection of things needed or wanted - but they function the same as &lt;em&gt;axioms&lt;/em&gt; of the analysis - unproven foundational statements as a basis for a derived system - and I prefer to use that terminology.  Whatever you'd like to name them, here they are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Degrees of plausibility are represented by real numbers&lt;/strong&gt;.  This is a choice of practicality.  Perhaps there is some value in probability represented with &lt;em&gt;complex numbers&lt;/em&gt;, but so far no useful generalization has been found to my knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualitative consistency with common sense&lt;/strong&gt;.  Specifically, the system must be consistent with standard Boolean logic - the logic of syllogisms and deductive logic.  This is not a generic call to "&lt;em&gt;common sense&lt;/em&gt;" to base the system on, but rather the short-hand informal speech that Jaynes likes to use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internal consistency&lt;/strong&gt;. If a conclusion can be reasoned out in more than one way then every possible way must yield the same result.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Propriety&lt;/strong&gt;.  We must take into account all of the information provided that is relevant to the question.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Equivalent states consistency&lt;/strong&gt;.  Equivalent states of knowledge must be represented by equivalent plausibility assignments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To quote Jaynes: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, most students are surprised to learn that our search for desiderata is at an end. The above conditions, it turns out, uniquely determine the rules by which [we] must reason; i.e. there is only one set of mathematical operations for manipulating plausibilities which has all these properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From these axioms, we can derive,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the sum and product rules of probability, which describe the process of combining bits of knowledge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bayes Rule, which describes the structure of learning from evidence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the marginalization rule, where model simplicity is attributed to fewer adjustable parameters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;deductive logic, the limit as the probabilities go to 0 and 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the dangers of either/or thinking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and much more!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important consequence of the derivation is that &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; system which disagrees with it must violate one or more of the axioms listed.  The entire approach shows that probability theory is far more fundamental than is typically appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="math"></category></entry><entry><title>Why Christian Apologetics is Faulty Science and Faulty History</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2019/May/17/why-christian-apologetics-is-faulty-science-and-faulty-history/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-05-17T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-05-17T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2019-05-17:/posts/2019/May/17/why-christian-apologetics-is-faulty-science-and-faulty-history/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In this episode I join Andrew and Matthew to discuss The Fine Tuning Argument, The Second Law of Thermodynamics, contingency, evidence for the Christian claim of a historical resurrection of …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In this episode I join Andrew and Matthew to discuss The Fine Tuning Argument, The Second Law of Thermodynamics, contingency, evidence for the Christian claim of a historical resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth, and other  topics found in Justin Brierley's book Unbelievable?: Why After Ten Years of Talking With Atheists, I'm Still a Christian.

&lt;p&gt;If you haven't seen &lt;a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/elizabeth_gilbert_on_genius?language=en#t-1065003"&gt;Elizabeth Gilbert's TED talk&lt;/a&gt; on "Your Elusive Creative Genius", go right now and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/elizabeth_gilbert_on_genius?language=en#t-1065003"&gt;watch it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;!  I haven't seen a talk lately which has transformed my thinking on a topic as much as this one.  To summarize, Gilbert observes that even with noted creative "geniuses" the process of creation is uneven.  The creative juices seem fickle even for the accomplished and the perception from others (and even themselves) is that these people have failed when they struggle to create again even after major successes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gilbert reminds us that this attitude toward creation is new to the enlightenment, and that prior to that the "genius" was an external being which visited a person and could leave or be uncooperative.  That the word "genius" and the word "genie" have obvious linguistic parallels was something I never noticed until this observation.  People who externalize the creative influence with a genie or muse  easily explain why they can be amazingly creative at one moment and be stuck in the next — the muse simply is not there.  In the Enlightenment, we rid ourselves of the superstition of these external agents and the "genius" was tied to the individual — and thus also the responsibility for being "stuck" was tied to the individual too.  By eliminating the muse we  place a burden on the individual which may be unjustified.  Gilbert speaks about the value of conversing with this external agent, saying things like &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Listen you, thing, you and I both know that if this book isn't brilliant that is not entirely my fault, right?  Because you can see that I am putting everything I have into this, I don't have any more than this.  If you want it to be better, you've got to show up and do your part of the deal. But if you don't do that, you know what, the hell with it. I'm going to keep writing anyway because that's my job. And I would please like the record to reflect today that I showed up for my part of the job."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="superstition-and-stories"&gt;Superstition and Stories&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is this "muse" or "genie" driving our creative energies?   I am not a fan of superstitious thinking, but this presentation got me thinking about the value of the story itself.  We are not in control of our creative output — it is the product of our genetic make-up and the entire history of our experiences.  When we have one thought follow another, our brain is accessing memories and impressions that have been built up in a complex process over the years of our interactions with others and with the world.  We can, as Gilbert says, control whether we show up for the work but we can't control what the next thought will be.  Given that we lack control of the process where our best creative ideas come from it makes sense to not hold ourselves accountable for them.  However, it is far too wordy to describe this situation to others (or even to ourselves) every time we experience a lack of creativity.  Given that humans are inherently story-driven beings there is some value in the short-hand of describing this "other" as an external agent, an effect outside of our immediate control.  One value of doing this is to refocus on the things for which we actually have control and to not burn needless psychological energy on the things we don't.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a danger of believing these agents actually exist as external beings, even if they "exist" as those factors of our mental processes which are outside of direct control.  Thinking this way, it makes clearer some of &lt;a href="https://quillette.com/2018/07/23/the-peculiar-opacity-of-jordan-petersons-religious-views/"&gt;Jordan Peterson's otherwise obtuse religious-speak&lt;/a&gt;.  Peterson latches onto religious metaphor and states that anyone asking if it is "literally true" is missing the point.  Perhaps Peterson's "God" is a name given to his moral "muse", and to admit it doesn't exist is the same to him as accepting responsibility for thoughts and actions beyond his control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still have to think through some of these issues but I do find it interesting how people lean on stories and short-cuts to help deal with life's challenges.  &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="articles"></category></entry><entry><title>Book Review - "Unbelievable?" by Justin Brierley</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2019/Feb/11/book-review-unbelievable-by-justin-brierley/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-02-11T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-02-11T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2019-02-11:/posts/2019/Feb/11/book-review-unbelievable-by-justin-brierley/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2 id="structure-of-the-review"&gt;Structure of the Review&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I finished this review it became apparent that there are two main audiences for what I wrote - those that have yet to read the book and those that have already read the book.  Therefore I decided to break the review up into two parts, one for each audience.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="for-those-that-have-not-yet-read-unbelievable"&gt;For those that have &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; yet read &lt;em&gt;Unbelievable?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id="context"&gt;Context&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been listening to &lt;a href="https://www.premierchristianradio.com/Shows/Saturday/Unbelievable"&gt;this podcast&lt;/a&gt; for years and even had a &lt;a href="http://bblais.github.io/search.html?q=unbelievable"&gt;project several years ago&lt;/a&gt; with the lofty goal of responding to each and every episode.  I did not achieve the goal, unfortunately.  The problem was two-fold:
1. There are too many episodes
2. Nearly every episode is so packed with interesting content that my responses were taking longer than a week to prepare, so I was always behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The podcast is a model of how discussions can go, even when the topic is contentious.  Justin Brierley is the epitome of civil.  Like a good moderator, it isn't always clear where he stands on the issue - it's even easy to ignore the fact that he's a believer himself!  He does an amazing job in the podcast of rephrasing what even his opponents state - skillfully  &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man#Steelmanning"&gt;steelmanning&lt;/a&gt; the entire time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book, &lt;a href="https://www.premierchristianradio.com/Shows/Saturday/Unbelievable/Unbelievable-the-Book"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unbelievable? Why After Ten Years of Talking with Atheists I'm Still a Christian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has all the best of the podcast in book form.  It's a plea for a return to civil discourse on hard topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Having conversations as one of the most important things we do in life“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Many conversation descend into the equivalent of verbal hand grenades being lobbed over the barricades of our carefully erected worldviews.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brierley demonstrates how you can respect a position that you disagree with and how you can -- without fear -- present someone else's argument even better than they can.  I can't help but think that this book was aptly timed for this age of quick sound-bites and tweets.  We live in a culture where it seems to be acceptable to malign your opponent without addressing their concerns or characterize their positions in such uncharitable ways that everyone speaks past each other.  It is a ray of light that this book - despite the fact that I disagree strongly with its conclusions - reaches across the aisle gently and respectfully with an invitation to engage in the discussion openly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is for this reason, out of respect, that I take a thoughtful, thorough approach to this review.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="structure-of-the-book"&gt;Structure of the Book&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the first chapter on &lt;em&gt;"Creating Better Conversations,"&lt;/em&gt; the book's chapters walk the reader through all of the standard arguments for God and Christianity, sprinkled with anecdotes from Brierley's interviews.  The book reads very nicely and has a conversational tone, introducing the reader to some of Brierley's original reasons for believing - from personal experience and revelation - and many other reasons to support which belief that he admits came later along.  The book is remarkably complete and as far as I can tell, hits all the major apologetics' points - including some arguments that have been circulating in the Christian community literally for thousands of years.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brierley explains the Cosmological Arguments and the Fine Tuning Arguments in the chapter &lt;em&gt;"God Makes Sense of Human Existence."&lt;/em&gt;  The Moral Arguments, likewise, are addressed in the chapter &lt;em&gt;"God Makes Sense of Human Value."&lt;/em&gt;  He continues with arguments from purpose, the existence of Jesus, the evidence for the Resurrection, and suffering. Brierley finishes the book with a pragmatic explanation of living in the "Christian Story" and the benefits of choosing to live in that way.  For anyone not familiar with the standard arguments for Christianity, &lt;em&gt;Unbelievable?&lt;/em&gt; is a great introduction and summary of the primary arguments.  For anyone who cares about civil and intelligent dialog, this book is for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="for-those-that-have-read-unbelievable"&gt;For those that have read &lt;em&gt;Unbelievable?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I am not convinced by these arguments and Brierley is where is the divide?  I will hopefully address this question in the rest of this review.  I break each of my responses into the appropriate topics, essentially following the order of the book, discussing where I disagree with Brierley's conclusions at many places.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must admit that most of the chapters present so much of &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; sides of the arguments that the book is unusually balanced for its genre.  It also means that this review is quite a bit longer than I would do for other books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="personal-experience"&gt;Personal Experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Brierley, by his own admission, personal experience is the primary reason for his &lt;em&gt;original&lt;/em&gt; conversion.  He refers to a personal experience in a youth retreat in 1995, calling it a “moment of surrender“ where God "showed up," noting that most if not all Christians would probably relate to this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I suspect that something similar is true for most people who call themselves Christians.  It's not that they can necessarily pinpoint a 'moment of surrender' like mine, but their faith is nevertheless grounded in an experience of God's presence in their lives, perhaps in some emotionally tangible way, or simply as a deep-down 'knowing' that has been there as long as they can remember." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've never had such an experience, at least not tangibly, so I can't address Brierley's experience directly.  However, we have learned from science that personal experience that isn't accessible to others doesn't typically track reality - it tracks subjectivity.  People have profound experiences quite often and then interpret these experiences in all sorts of ways.  This does not mean that those interpretations are correct, even if the experiences themselves are real.  It is only through an honest exploration of the possible explanations, through prediction and skepticism, that we can achieve something close to the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think Brierley would disagree with this - which is why he goes to great pains to explore the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="second-law-of-thermodynamics"&gt;Second Law of Thermodynamics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My dad also said something else. As a scientist he found it intriguing that the emergence of life on our planet seems to disobey one of the fundamental laws of nature. The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that, when left to their own devices, all closed systems (such as our universe), will move towards increasing 'entropy' -- the scientific word for disorder.“ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every physicist will tell you why this is an incorrect statement - because the earth is not a closed system.  Under the logic of this quote, even something like frozen ice would not be produced on the earth because it is a lower entropy state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've had a bad experience with this particular argument in University.  The correction to the argument is both easy to find.  Further, unlike other such arguments, you won't find any disagreement with any physicist you ask.  It is the fact that the answer is so easy to find and consistent with the experts that there really is no excuse left to keep using this argument.  Even so, I have seen Christians use it &lt;em&gt;even after being corrected&lt;/em&gt;.  The claim is so outlandish, from a physical point of view, that if a scientist actually believed it, they would have to admit that a frozen pond (also a decrease in entropy) would be impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The claim presented in this quote represents a pervasive lack of imagination on the part of the theist where they seemingly can't wrap their brains around the idea that complexity can arise from natural processes.  This lack of imagination infects not just this argument, but the fine tuning argument, other arguments from design, and even the moral argument. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fine-tuning"&gt;Fine Tuning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sean Carroll, an outspoken cosmologist from CalTech, says that &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qKZqPy9T8&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=2305"&gt;the Fine Tuning Argument is the "theist's best argument"&lt;/a&gt; and it is well communicated in "&lt;em&gt;Unbelievable?&lt;/em&gt;."  The problem is that, despite the confident claims of many theists, the physicists are not at all clear how much fine tuning there is or if there is any at all.  The way fine tuning is demonstrated starts with noticing that there are some &lt;em&gt;seemingly arbitrary&lt;/em&gt; constants in our physical laws (e.g. speed of light, expansion rate of the universe, etc...).  These constants if &lt;em&gt;varied independently&lt;/em&gt; lead to conditions where life &lt;em&gt;as we know it&lt;/em&gt;  couldn't form.  The emphasis here is to point out the problems with making confident claims about these observations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the constants may be determined by other laws we don't know right now.  This has happened already for the expansion rate of the universe, which can be specifically derived from Einstein's equations - and shown to not be fine-tuned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the constants may not be independent, so changing one may necessitate changing another by a specific amount negating the effect&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we don't understand the conditions &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; for life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these objections, it seems premature to make any strong statements about fine tuning even if you are convinced it is there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="something-out-of-nothing"&gt;Something out of nothing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is telling, I think, that the primary scientific arguments for God rely on the fringes of the known science into the unknown.  William Lane Craig makes a great deal out of the absurd notion of something "popping into existence" from nothing - and to allow even one instance of it would allow things like bicycles to appear out of nothing.  However, he doesn't address Sean Carroll directly who shows that models of the origin of the universe have some things able to appear out of nothing and other things not.  These models actually make &lt;em&gt;predictions&lt;/em&gt; for things we may observe, e.g. correlations in the microwave background, values of the early universe entropy, etc...  What &lt;em&gt;predictions&lt;/em&gt; do the theistic models actually make about the properties of the observable universe?  None to my knowledge.  It is clear that science and religion are playing by different rules here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="contingent-vs-necessary"&gt;Contingent vs Necessary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brierley comments about the argument from contingency, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I've been struck by the obvious yet remarkable fact that there is &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; at all. [...]  Like Leibniz, I can see that it's perfectly logically possible that there could have been nothing at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not a philosopher and am unconvinced by words like &lt;em&gt;contingent&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt;.  For example, I do not see any support for the claim that there are &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; objects, or that a &lt;em&gt;being&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;mind&lt;/em&gt; could satify the requirements to be &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt;.  Maybe the only things that can be &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; are things like laws of logic, and that objects don't fit that criterion.  I don't know!  But until these are actually &lt;em&gt;demonstrated&lt;/em&gt; and not just &lt;em&gt;asserted&lt;/em&gt;, all of the arguments based on them have no content.  In the same way, perhaps the concept of "&lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt;" isn't well defined and can't manifest in reality, so the question "why is there something rather than nothing" is answered simply with "because 'nothing' isn't realizable".  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s nothing about our universe to suggest that it had to exist rather its existence is contingent. It needs an explanation of his existence.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would add as an analogy that there’s nothing about our experience on the Earth to suggest that the Earth is round or that it orbits the sun.  It may be &lt;em&gt;logically&lt;/em&gt; possible to have a flat planet, but not &lt;em&gt;physically&lt;/em&gt; realizable in our universe (note: the spherical nature of planets is due to the spherical form of the law of gravitation).  Our intuitions do not always track the truth, and truth should be our goal.  As a scientist, I am accustomed to cases of seemingly obvious things being false, and of seemingly impossible things being true irrespective of our intuitions.  Thus, strictly &lt;em&gt;philosophical arguments&lt;/em&gt; are not enough to demonstrate the existence of something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="language-of-the-universe"&gt;Language of the Universe&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is the universe written in the language of mathematics? Brierley says,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who want to ask `Why?', atheism's only answer seems to be that it is a massive coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t see it as a coincidence I see it as a requirement. In &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; universe that has any patterns at all such that life could possibly exist - no matter what form of life - then those living beings would discover those patterns as the "mathematics" of that universe.  It doesn't surprise me that there are patterns in the universe, but I still agree with Brierley that it is an amazing thing that the universe exists at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"So does science provide iron-clad proof for God's existence? No.  Could the scientific consensus change in the future?  Of course it could.  Is this all there is to say on the subject?  Certainly not.  The case for God is a cumulative one that reaches well beyond science..."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I can quibble about the use of "proof" here (science doesn't deal in proof, only evidence) I'd rather take the time to extend the notion of "science" to include things like history as well as the study of morality, which moves into the next chapters.  Really, what I am thinking is that rational discourse combined with skeptical attitudes are the components that include science and these other topics.  In the case of the universe existing, perhaps an "I don't know" is the best answer we have right now, until someone is imaginative enough to find a way to determine it.  To posit the answer "I know, and it is God" requires a level of explanation and prediction far above what any theist seems able to give.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="moral-argument"&gt;Moral argument&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In discussing human value, Brierley writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It was grim stuff, admittedly, but it was a moment which exposed the problem for atheists who affirm the subjective nature of morality but then find themselves in a bind when it comes to truly horrendous acts.  They don't just feel wrong.  They &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; wrong.  Period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He concludes the chapter with,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I have tried to persuade you of two things in this chapter.  First, that humans have a real inherent worth and dignity that transcends a purely evolutionary story of how morality came to be.  Second, if humans have such a value then it only makes sense if there is someone beyond nature who can assign them such value, the God who created them in his own image.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not generally swayed by the moral argument for a few reasons.  First, I think that much is made out the subjective/objective dichotomy that someone like Sam Harris already handles consistently.  In &lt;em&gt;The Moral Landscape&lt;/em&gt;, he is able to define morality as the concern for the suffering and well-being of conscious creatures which, even if done imperfectly, coincides well with all of the sorts of problems we associate with moral choices.  In this way, he describes an &lt;em&gt;objective&lt;/em&gt; basis for morality without resorting to outside agency.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My second issue is that the supposed solution - "God did it" - fails the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthyphro_dilemma"&gt;"Euthyphro dilemma"&lt;/a&gt; - the question whether something is good because God wills it or whether God wills it because it is good.  In the former, we get the repugnant conclusion that if God commands murder it is necessarily good (the good of a dictator).  In the latter, the good transcends God so we don't need God for the existence of the good.  The only way out of this dilemma that I have ever heard is the claim that "the standard of the Good is God’s very nature" (William Lane Craig) or something similar.  This seems to me to be word games to define your way out of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My final issue with the moral argument is that it seems to me that, like the argument from personal revelation, the argument itself relies on the &lt;em&gt;intuitive&lt;/em&gt; notion that there are some things that are &lt;em&gt;objectively&lt;/em&gt; wrong: things like murder and rape are objectively wrong, to deny this seems abhorrent, and everyone has this intuition.  Since, in other contexts (e.g. flat unmoving Earth), we have already seen that our intuitions fail in many situations, is it possible that it is failing here and we just don't see it?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore this line of thinking, one should notice that in the moral argument the usual extremes are always trotted out - murder and rape - and not something a bit more ambiguous. Since this argument holds a lot of emotional weight, perhaps we can explore this in a different way, and leave ourselves at least agnostic on this issue.  We have here some models of the source of morality - and I am neither promoting or denying any of these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Model 1: an external agent has imprinted some specific objective standards on everyone (perhaps imperfectly, like the sense of sight is imperfect). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Model 2: a naturalistic process is responsible for the &lt;em&gt;perceived&lt;/em&gt; standard through evolution. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Model 3: a naturalistic process is responsible for the standard (perceived or real) based on suffering/well being. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be others, but let's stick to these for a second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, all three models explain the &lt;em&gt;perception&lt;/em&gt; that murder and rape are objectively wrong. It would seem obvious from an evolutionary perspective that for social creatures, murder and rape would &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; objectively wrong. These three models all predict that we would have some divergence on more subtle issues, although I think not to the same degree. Model 1 would further imply that even on these more subtle aspects of morality there should eventually be convergence - the moral status of same-sex couples, for example. Models 2 and 3 would imply that there would be huge cultural differences between groups on the more subtle questions. Given our observations, this would seem to be evidence against Model 1 and the moral argument for God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In either case, if you have Models 1-3, a scientist would require further predictions that would help us actually distinguish between an agent-imparted standard and one without, even when both are consistent with our intuition about the extreme moral questions.  To say more would be presuming what the data would be without actually testing it.  We land, then, at least on the side of unconvinced but perhaps hopeful for the moral argument. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="human-purpose"&gt;Human purpose&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You and your beliefs are the product of a long chain of inevitable physical events. [...] It's all just a series of physical events - billiard balls bouncing off one another.  They aren't the least bit interested in the truth or falsity of the thoughts they are producing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the self-defeating nature of the naturalist worldview was a penny-dropping moment for me.  It meant that seeking meaning of any sort was a self-defeating enterprise for a thoroughgoing atheist.    Just as the collisions of the balls on the billiard-table only mean anything if there is a player who intended them to find a pocket, so we must be more than the matter that makes up our brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here again, I think Brierley is failing from a lack of imagination.  Meaning is a structure we attribute to actions and events in our lives. It seems to follow naturally from our pattern-seeking tendencies combined with our goals to increase well-being.  I find nothing too problematic with this view, even if we don't currently understand the detailed nature of consciousness.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a downside to notice for the "meaning from God" perspective, and that is the fact that the notion of eternal life in heaven makes &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; life not have any meaning, due to its finiteness.  Even if this life is supposedly a test for admission, the fact that the current life is &lt;em&gt;finite&lt;/em&gt; compared to the &lt;em&gt;infinite&lt;/em&gt; afterlife is enough to rob it of any significant meaning.  Clearly there are arguments on each side for this, but I just wanted to point out that it isn't completely clear even on the theistic perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="historical-arguments"&gt;Historical arguments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brierley nicely summarizes the historical arguments, both in the establishment of the existence of Jesus and the arguments of the Resurrection.  My largest concern with these arguments is the amount of trust that is placed in historical methods.  When confronted with the idea that we can't know the details of historical events to the level of repeatable, physical experiments, most people don't seem to take issue.  However, the claim that someone rose from the dead is something that - in a modern context - we'd want medical records, corroborating physical evidence, and we'd still be pretty skeptical that someone was putting us on.  Placing these events two thousand years ago, written decades after the events, by largely anonymous sources should make us &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; confident in the claim, not more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;minimal facts&lt;/em&gt; approach to the historicity of the Resurrection seems to be a major selling point for Christian apologists.  Although not a historian myself, I have read enough to see that this approach seems to never be used for any other historical event - why the special case?  I have personally found that &lt;a href="https://celsus.blog/2013/06/29/knocking-out-the-pillars-of-the-minimal-facts-apologetic/"&gt;the response by Matthew Ferguson&lt;/a&gt; - who is a historian - is as complete a response that one will ever find, and haven't seen anything even remotely convincing as a reply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-atheists-greatest-objection-suffering"&gt;The Atheist's Greatest Objection - Suffering&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll start my response here to point out that the argument from suffering is not the atheist's greatest objection.  &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRB0TDq8tWE"&gt;Like Matt Dillahunty&lt;/a&gt;, in my opinion the greatest objection to the theistic claim of the existence of God is from &lt;em&gt;hiddenness&lt;/em&gt;.  True to Brierley's form, he grapples well with all sides of the issue of suffering, bringing in all of the typical theistic counter arguments - but they are all indirect.  He implores us to appreciate how the preponderance of the other arguments for God "tips the scale towards belief in God."  He puts forward the idea that the objection is baseless because of the lack of objective morality under the atheist worldview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"it's  difficult to see how the reality of a world of moral right and wrong can exist in the absence of God. But the question being asked by the atheist is a fundamentally moral one."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He appeals to mystery,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"it is a mystery we believe will be answered in a day of final justice and joy when Jesus Christ sets the world to right."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and free will, hidden purpose of suffering, and an allegory.  Books have been written on this problem, and this chapter summarizes the topic nicely.  I am not moved by it because it feels to me - like all treatments of this topic - one excuse after another with nothing to pin it down.  As Sam Harris says, one can always answer the question "is suffering and evil consistent with God?" with a "yes" - the better question to ask is, "does the suffering we observe in the world &lt;em&gt;suggest&lt;/em&gt; there is an all-knowing, benevolent God?"  To that, the answer is clearly "no".  Sure!  You can always come up with reasons for the former, but the later is much clearer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hiddenness"&gt;Hiddenness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The really big objection, in my view, is hiddenness - the lack of obvious indicators of a divine presence.  If God actually wants a &lt;em&gt;relationship&lt;/em&gt; with people then God's lack of obvious existence is completely inconsistent with that, in a way that appealing to free will, the purpose of relationship, allegory and mystery just don't work.  If you look at nearly every one of my responses, it really comes down to not being convinced due to the lack of unambiguous evidence.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusions"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could go on with this review, but it is long enough as it is.  I applaud Brierley's efforts in summarizing 10 years of conversations on this topic.  I totally endorse his goal of improving conversation on difficult topics; and his tone in this book and the podcast should be a model for everyone.  Perhaps Brierley's book is just one more data point of confirmation bias, and perhaps my review is also.  How do we get past that?  The best way is to have the conversations, honestly and completely, and to constantly question your own perspective.  I want to thank Brierley for his fine work and hope he continues these efforts far into the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="religion"></category></entry><entry><title>Dynamical systems with pyndamics</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2019/Jan/14/dynamical-systems-with-pyndamics/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-01-14T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-01-14T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2019-01-14:/posts/2019/Jan/14/dynamical-systems-with-pyndamics/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Describe dynamical systems in terms of the differential equations without having to write the coding loops or functions.

&lt;p&gt;Mathematical models of epidemic dynamics offer significant insight into predicting and controlling infectious diseases. The dynamics of a disease model generally follow a susceptible, infected, and recovered (SIR) model, with some standard modifications. In this paper, we extend the work of Munz et.al (2009) on the application of disease dynamics to the so-called ``zombie apocalypse'', and then apply the identical methods to influenza dynamics. Unlike Munz et.al (2009), we include data taken from specific depictions of zombies in popular culture films and apply Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods on improved dynamical representations of the system. To demonstrate the usefulness of this approach, beyond the entertaining example, we apply the identical methodology to Google Trend data on influenza to establish infection and recovery rates. Finally, we discuss the use of the methods to explore hypothetical intervention policies regarding disease outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we explore a variety of models attempting to explain the pollution-income relationship (PIR). There has been much literature addressing the notion of an environmental Kuznets curve (EKC). Many researchers find an EKC relationship for certain pollutants, while others do not find evidence of an EKC relationship. There is also literature formally critiquing the EKC. We employ cross-sectional, panel, and time-series analysis to add insight into the relationship between economic growth and environmental degradation, a research area that is far from consensual and that has practical implications. We ultimately find that the clearest case of an EKC effect in our study arises in the analysis of organic water pollution, while there is modest evidence suggesting an EKC effect with regard to CO2, NO, and methane. We also present ample evidence suggesting an anti-EKC effect for PM10. Our analysis causes us to question the existence of an EKC effect throughout the environment in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We measured I'C and I'15N values and carbon and nitrogen elemental concentrations of leaves collected from Metasequoia glyptostroboides Hu et Cheng trees cultivated at 39 sites across the United States under different latitudes and climatic regions. I'D values from south facing leaf n-alkanes of 27 trees were also determined. Climate data over the past 50 years (1950a2009) were compiled from stations near each site. Isotope data were cross plotted against each geographic and climatic parameter, including latitude, annual mean temperature (AMT), spring (FebruaryaMay) mean temperature (SMT), annual mean precipitation (AMP), and spring mean precipitation (SMP). Statistical analyses revealed the following signicant correlations: 1) a strong negative correlation between n-alkane D and latitude; 2) statistically signicant correlations between D and both AMT and SMT; 3) a weaker but still signicant correlation between I'D and SMP; 4) statistically signicant relationships between carbon concentration and both temperature and precipitation parameters, especially AMP; 5) an unexpected correlation between nitrogen concentration and SMP. These results bear strong implications for using I'13C and I'D values obtained from fossil Metasequoia as paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental proxies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the present work we introduce the problem of determining the probability that a rotating and bouncing cylinder (i.e. flipped coin) will land and come to rest on its edge. We present this problem and analysis as a practical, nontrivial example to introduce the reader to Bayesian model comparison. Several models are presented, each of which take into consideration different physical aspects of the problem and the relative effects on the edge landing probability. The Bayesian formulation of model comparison is then used to compare the models and their predictive agreement with data from hand-flipped cylinders of several sizes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is theory possible in neuroscience? Not only possible, in our opinion, necessary. For a system as complex as the brain it is obvious that we cannot just make observations. (The number of possible observations is substantially larger than the available number of scientist-hours, even projecting several centuries into the future.) Without a theoretical structure to connect diverse observations with one another, the result would be a listing of facts of little use in understanding what the brain is about.In the work that follows, we present the Bienenstock, Cooper and Munro (BCM) theory of synaptic plasticity. The theory is sufficiently concrete so that it can be and, as is discussed below, has been compared with experiment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monocular deprivation experiments can be used to distinguish between different ideas concerning properties of cortical synaptic plasticity. Monocular deprivation by lid suture causes a rapid disconnection of the deprived eye connected to cortical neurons whereas total inactivation of the deprived eye produces much less of an ocular dominance shift. In order to understand these results one needs to know how lid suture and retinal inactivation affect neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) that provide the cortical input. Recent experimental results by Linden et al. showed that monocular lid suture and monocular inactivation do not change the mean firing rates of LGN neurons but that lid suture reduces correlations between adjacent neurons whereas monocular inactivation leads to correlated firing. These, somewhat surprising, results contradict assumptions that have been made to explain the outcomes of different monocular deprivation protocols. Based on these experimental results we modify our assumptions about inputs to cortex during different deprivation protocols and show their implications when combined with different cortical plasticity rules. Using theoretical analysis, random matrix theory and simulations we show that high levels of correlations reduce the ocular dominance shift in learning rules that depend on homosynaptic depression (i.e., Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro type rules), consistent with experimental results, but have the opposite effect in rules that depend on heterosynaptic depression (i.e., Hebbian/principal component analysis type rules).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ocular dominance (OD) plasticity is a robust paradigm for examining the functional consequences of synaptic plasticity. Previous experimental and theoretical results have shown that OD plasticity can be accounted for by known synaptic plasticity mechanisms, using the assumption that deprivation by lid suture eliminates spatial structure in the deprived channel. Here we show that in the mouse, recovery from monocular lid suture can be obtained by subsequent binocular lid suture but not by dark rearing. This poses a significant challenge to previous theoretical results. We therefore performed simulations with a natural input environment appropriate for mouse visual cortex. In contrast to previous work we assume that lid suture causes degradation but not elimination of spatial structure, whereas dark rearing produces elimination of spatial structure. We present experimental evidence that supports this assumption, measuring responses through sutured lids in the mouse. The change in assumptions about the input environment is sufficient to account for new experimental observations, while still accounting for previous experimental results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BCM (Bienenstock et al., 1982) refers to the theory of synaptic modification first proposed by Elie Bienenstock, Leon Cooper, and Paul Munro in 1982 to account for experiments measuring the selectivity of neurons in primary sensory [8]cortex and its dependency on neuronal input. It is characterized by a rule expressing synaptic change as a Hebb-like product of the presynaptic activity and a nonlinear function, \phi(y;\theta_M) , of postsynatic activity, y. For low values of the postsynaptic activity ( y&amp;lt;\theta_M ), \phi is negative; for y&amp;gt;\theta_M , \phi is positive. The rule is stabilized by allowing the modification threshold, \theta_M , to vary as a super-linear function of the previous activity of the cell. Unlike traditional methods of stabilizing Hebbian learning, this "sliding threshold" provides a mechanism for incoming patterns, as opposed to converging afferents, to compete. A detailed exploration can be found in the book Theory of Cortical Plasticity (Cooper et al., 2004). For an open-source implementation of the BCM, amongst other synaptic modification rules, see the Plasticity package1(http://plasticity.googlecode.com/) .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our collaborative research proposes to study the synaptic and cellular basis of receptive field plasticity in visual cortex. Recently some of our efforts have concentrated on accounting for novel aspects of cellular responses and plasticity observed in the visual cortex of the rat. In recently published findings we provided evidence that pairing visual cues with subsequent rewards in awake behaving animals results in the emergence, in the primary visual cortex (V1), of reward-timing activity (Shuler and Bear, 2006). Further, the properties of reward-timing activity suggest that it is generated locally within V1, implying that V1 is privy to a signal relating the acquisition of reward. We provide here a model demonstrating how such interval timing of reward could emerge in V1. A fundamental assumption of this work is that the timing characteristics of the V1 network are encoded in the lateral connectivity within the network, consequently the plasticity assumed in this model is of these recurrent connections. Using this assumption, no prior stimulus-locked temporal representation is necessary. The plasticity of recurrent connections is implemented through an interaction between an activity dependent Hebbian like plasticity, and a neuromodulatory signal signifying reward. It is demonstrated that such a global reinforcement signal is sufficient for interval time learning by stabilizing changes in nascent synaptic efficacy resultant from prior visually-evoked activity. By modifying synaptic weight change within the recurrent network of V1, our model transforms temporally restricted visual events into neurally persistent activity relating to their associated reward timing expectancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Synaptic plasticity is a likely basis for information storage by the neocortex. Understanding cortical plasticity requires coordinated investigation of both underlying cellular mechanisms and their systems-level consequences in the same model system. However, establishing connections between the cellular and system levels of description is non-trivial. A major contribution of theoretical neuroscience is that it can link different levels of description, and in doing so can direct experiments to the questions of greatest relevance. The objective of the current project is to generate a theoretical description of experience-dependent plasticity in the rodent visual system. The advantages of rodents are, first, that knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity is relatively mature and continues to be advanced with genetic and pharmacological experiments, and second, rodents show robust receptive field plasticity in visual cortex (VC) that can be easily and inexpensively monitored with chronic recording methods. The project aims are threefold. First, the activity of inputs to rat visual cortex will be recorded in different viewing conditions that induce receptive field (RF) plasticity, and these data will be integrated into formal models of synaptic plasticity. Second, the dynamics of RF plasticity will be simulated using existing spike rate-based algorithms and compared will experimental observations. Third, the consequences of new biophysically plausible plasticity algorithms, based on spike timing and metaplasticity, will be analyzed and compared with experiments.6&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rate-based neuron models have been successful in understanding many aspects of development such as the development of orientation selectivity(Bienenstock et al., 1982; Oja, 1982; Linsker, 1986; Miller, 1992; Bell and Sejnowski, 1997), the particular dynamics of visual deprivation(Blais et al., 1999) and the development of direction selectivity(Wimbauer et al., 1997; Blais et al., 2000). These models do not address phenomena such as temporal coding, spike-timing dependant synaptic plasticity, or any short-time behavior of neurons. More detailed spiking models (Song et.al, 2000; Shouval et.al. 2002; Yeung et.al. 2004) address these issues, and have had some success, but have failed to develop receptive fields in natural environments. These more detailed models are diffiult to explore, given their large number of parameters and the run-time computational limitations. In addition, their results are often diffiult to compare directly with the rate-based models. &lt;p&gt;We propose a model, which we call a spiking-rate model, which can serve as a middle-ground between the over simplistic rate-based models, and the more detailed spiking models. The spiking-rate model is a spiking model where all of the underlying processes are continuous Poisson, the summation of inputs is entirely linear (although non-linearities can be added), and the generation of outputs is done by calculating a rate output and then generating an appropriate Poisson spike train. In this way, the limiting behavior is identical to a rate-based model, but the proper ties of spiking models can be incorporated more easily. We present the development of receptive i!elds with this model in various visual environments. We then present the necessary conditions for the receptive field development in the spiking-rate models, and make comparisons to detailed spiking models, in order to more clearly understand the necessary conditions for receptive field development&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modifications in the strengths of synapses are thought to underlie memory, learning, and development of cortical circuits. Many cellular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity have been investigated in which differential elevations of postsynaptic calcium concentrations play a key role in determining the direction and magnitude of synaptic changes. We have previously described a model of plasticity that uses calcium currents mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors as the associative signal for Hebbian learning. However, this model is not completely stable. Here, we propose a mechanism of stabilization through homeostatic regulation of intracellular calcium levels. With this model, synapses are stable and exhibit properties such as those observed in metaplasticity and synaptic scaling. In addition, the model displays synaptic competition, allowing structures to emerge in the synaptic space that reflect the statistical properties of the inputs. Therefore, the combination of a fast calcium-dependent learning and a slow stabilization mechanism can account for both the formation of selective receptive fields and the maintenance of neural circuits in a state of equilibrium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This invaluable book presents a theory of cortical plasticity and shows how this theory leads to experiments that test both its assumptions and consequences. It ellucidates, in a manner that is accessible to students as well as researchers, the role which the BCM theory has played in guiding research and suggesting experiments that have led to our present understanding of the mechanisms underlying cortical plasticity. Most of the connections betwen theory and experiment that are discussed require complex simulations. A unique feature of the book is the accompanying software package, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="plasticity/index.html"&gt;Plasticity&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;. This is provided complete with source code, and enables the reader to repeat any of the simulations quoted in the book as well as to vary either parameters or assumptions. &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="plasticity/index.html"&gt;Plasticity&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt; is thus a research and an educational tool. Readers can use it to obtain hands-on knowledge of the structure of BCM and various other learning algorithms. They can check and replicate our results as well as test algorithms and refinements of their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Everything …&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In  his &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TerTgDEgUE&amp;amp;t=583s"&gt;talk about the limitations of science&lt;/a&gt;, Rupert Sheldrake lists the "10 dogmas of modern science" (also listed here in text  &lt;a href="http://wariscrime.com/new/the-ten-dogmas-of-modern-science/"&gt;http://wariscrime.com/new/the-ten-dogmas-of-modern-science/&lt;/a&gt;).  They are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everything is essentially mechanical. Dogs, for example, are complex mechanisms, rather than living organisms with goals of their own. Even people are machines, ‘lumbering robots’, in Richard Dawkins’s vivid phrase, with brains that are like genetically programmed computers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All matter is unconscious. It has no inner life or subjectivity or point of view. Even human consciousness is an illusion produced by the material activities of brains.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The total amount of matter and energy is always the same (with the exception of the Big Bang, when all the matter and energy of the universe suddenly appeared).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The laws of nature are fixed. They are the same today as they were at the beginning, and they will stay the same for ever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nature is purposeless, and evolution has no goal or direction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All biological inheritance is material, carried in the genetic material, DNA, and in other material structures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minds are inside heads and are nothing but the activities of brains. When you look at a tree, the image of the tree you are seeing is not ‘out there’, where it seems to be, but inside your brain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Memories are stored as material traces in brains and are wiped out at death.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unexplained phenomena like telepathy are illusory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mechanistic medicine is the only kind that really works.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are presented as dogmas, unquestioned by scientists and taken for granted.  Many of these are demonstrably false or misleading.  When he states (1) that animals and people "are complex mechanisms, rather than living organisms with goals of their own", this is an either-or fallacy.  They could be &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; mechanisms and agents.  It could be that we use different vocabulary on different scales - I don't describe baseball in terms of quantum mechanics, even though I am confident that all the components of baseball is governed by quantum mechanics.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sheldrake lists a number of things which are poorly understood, for which there is a growing list of research, the conclusions of which are not taken dogmatically.  Similarly, there are a number of things in the list where research has been done, and the current perspective (not dogma!) has been arrived at because there has been no evidence to support the alternatives that Sheldrake is implying.   Examples of these include (2) "All matter is unconscious", (8) "Memories are stored as material traces", (5) "evolution has no goal", (7) "Minds are inside heads".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With (3), although energy is conserved (in a closed system) and matter is a subset of energy, it is not believed that the Big Bang &lt;em&gt;produced&lt;/em&gt; energy.  Rather, if the universe came from nothing then the total energy of the universe must be zero - which it empirically seems to be.  If the universe did not come from nothing, but came out of a universe-producing process then the energy didn’t “suddenly appear” as Sheldrake suggests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As to (4), the so-called fixed laws of Nature are a theory - which explains and is consistent with a huge variety of observations.  Thus, we are &lt;em&gt;confident&lt;/em&gt; in this particular theory.  It is possible, though, that the laws to change - and that would be measurable.  It is not taken as a dogma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Point (9) "Unexplained phenomena like telepathy are illusory" is misleading, given its incompleteness.  It seems that, given &lt;em&gt;years&lt;/em&gt; of observation, telepathy is in fact illusory.  However, there are many unexplained phenomena that are not illusory, e.g. dark matter, the placebo effect, etc...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In every one of these cases, scientists don't hold these as &lt;em&gt;dogmas&lt;/em&gt;.  If you have evidence, then present it!  If it turns out that you can demonstrate telepathy, that would be fantastic - but everyone who has tried so far has not been able to demonstrate it.  It may be that the universe has purpose, and perhaps it is possible to differentiate a process with a purpose from one without in certain circumstances, but the person making the claim of the extra “purpose” must be the one to bear the burden of proof. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it is easier for Sheldrake to accuse someone of a dogmatic view rather than do the hard work of actually convincing them with evidence.  Just because I disagree with you doesn't mean that I am dogmatically holding to my view - you just haven't done your homework. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="science"></category><category term="science"></category></entry><entry><title>There is more than enough time</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2018/May/24/there-is-more-than-enough-time/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-05-24T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-05-24T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2018-05-24:/posts/2018/May/24/there-is-more-than-enough-time/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here are some notes about time management that I found useful from &lt;a href="https://www.inc.com/benjamin-p-hardy/theres-more-than-enough-time-when-you-use-the-time.html"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good Things Are A Dime-A-Dozen&lt;/strong&gt;.  For me, passively watching a movie with my kids is good. However, actively engaging with them—whether playing games, laughing, playing out in the yard—is better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The problem with doing good things is that they are easy to justify, because they are inherently good. But, as Jim Collins, author of Good To Great, has said, “Good is the enemy of great. Few people attain great lives, in large part because it is just so easy to settle for a good life.”&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you read Harris' Cookbook exposition, you never see Peterson the same again.  Peterson claims that he only believes those interpretations that can be tied to four difference levels of understanding simultaneously, but I think that ends up being a smokescreen and that the same linguistic gymnastics can be done even in this case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with such hermeneutical efforts [...] is that they are perfectly unconstrained by the contents of the texts themselves. One can interpret every text in such a way as to yield almost any mystical or occult instruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A case in point: I have selected another book at random, this time from the cookbook aisle of a bookstore. The book is &lt;em&gt;A Taste of Hawaii: New Cooking from the Crossroads of the Pacific&lt;/em&gt;. Therein I have discovered an as yet uncelebrated mystical treatise. While it appears to be a recipe for wok-seared fish and shrimp cakes with ogo-tomato relish, we need only study its list of ingredients to know that we are in the presence of an unrivaled spiritual intelligence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;snapper filet, cubed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 teaspoons chopped scallions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;salt and freshly ground black pepper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a dash of cayenne pepper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 teaspoons chopped fresh ginger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 teaspoon minced garlic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8 shrimp, peeled, deveined, and cubed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1⁄2 cup heavy cream; 2 eggs, lightly beaten&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 teaspoons rice wine; 2 cups bread crumbs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 tablespoons vegetable oil; 2 1⁄2 cups ogo-tomato relish&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;snapper filet&lt;/em&gt;, of course, is the individual himself —you and I— awash in the sea of existence. But here we find it cubed, which is to say that our situation must be remedied in all three dimensions of body, mind, and spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Three teaspoons of chopped scallions&lt;/em&gt; further partakes of the cubic symmetry, suggesting that that which we need add to each level of our being by way of antidote comes likewise in equal proportions. The import of the passage is clear: the body, mind, and spirit need to be tended to with the same care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Salt and freshly ground black pepper&lt;/em&gt;: here we have the perennial invocation of opposites—the white and the black aspects of our nature. Both good and evil must be understood if we would fulfill the recipe for spiritual life. Nothing, after all, can be excluded from the human experience (this seems to be a Tantric text). What is more, salt and pepper come to us in the form of grains, which is to say that our good and bad qualities are born of the tiniest actions. Thus, we are not good or evil in general, but only by virtue of innumerable moments, which color the stream of our being by force of repetition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A dash of cayenne pepper&lt;/em&gt;: clearly, being of such robust color and flavor, this signifies the spiritual influence of an enlightened adept. What shall we make of the ambiguity of its measurement? How large is a dash? Here we must rely upon the wisdom of the universe at large. The teacher himself will know precisely what we need by way of instruction. And it is at just this point in the text that the ingredients that bespeak the heat of spiritual endeavor are added to the list—for after a dash of cayenne pepper, we find two teaspoons of chopped fresh ginger and one teaspoon of minced garlic. These form an isosceles trinity of sorts, signifying the two sides of our spiritual nature (male and female) united with the object meditation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next comes &lt;em&gt;eight shrimp—peeled, deveined, and cubed&lt;/em&gt;. The eight shrimp, of course, represent the eight worldly concerns that every spiritual aspirant must decry: fame and shame; loss and gain; pleasure and pain; praise and blame. Each needs to be deveined, peeled, and cubed— that is, purged of its power to entrance us and incorporated on the path of practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That such metaphorical acrobatics can be performed on almost any text—and that they are therefore meaningless—should be obvious.&lt;/p&gt;

As far as I can tell, the Scrum process derives its value from a few key concepts, which can equally well apply to individuals as well as teams, to academia as well as software development.  These key concepts, as I see them is, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work is done in a short, cyclical pattern: 1-2 week "sprints"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The work - the goals, on deck (aka backlog), work in progress, and done - is &lt;em&gt;displayed publicly&lt;/em&gt; (or at least prominently to the team) &lt;em&gt;at all times&lt;/em&gt;.  This is typically done with a physical &lt;a href="https://manifesto.co.uk/agile-concepts-scrum-task-board/"&gt;scrum board&lt;/a&gt;, but can also be done in software.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;em&gt;demonstration&lt;/em&gt; occurs at the end a work "sprint".  The result of the sprint is something &lt;em&gt;deliverable&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;complete&lt;/em&gt;, even if small, and this is demonstrate to the people to whom the work has value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;em&gt;review of the process and results&lt;/em&gt; occurs regularly at the end of each sprint&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If working on a team, we add the further concept&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A team needs to have &lt;em&gt;absolutely everyone&lt;/em&gt; who is needed to complete the work.  This will often involve people at many levels of a hierarchy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an addition, there are a few other things I learned from the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The role of management is to &lt;em&gt;remove the impediments&lt;/em&gt; to getting projects done.  So, part of the review process is to list the impediments to the work so that management can work on that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short (15-minute) "scrum" meetings answering "what have I done since the last, what are my impediments, what am I going to get done"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focussing on &lt;em&gt;value&lt;/em&gt; rather than work is more productive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The "deliver quickly" and adapt is a better strategy than trying to deliver a large, complete, and possibly incorrect product.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile I am also working my way through the book &lt;em&gt;Agile Faculty: Practical Strategies for Managing Research, Service and Teaching.&lt;/em&gt; (http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/A/bo26106581.html) I'm interested if any of these ideas will help in my own practices, and whether I can gain some benefit for the department and university processes with these ideas.  &lt;/p&gt;

Two questions were raised as evidence for God that I think are telling:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how do you get life from non-life?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how do you get the personal from the impersonal?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answers to these questions points to the properties of God, as traditionally understood.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first reaction is, even if we didn’t know the answers to these questions we would still not be in a position to make a positive claim for the explanation (e.g. God) without making the further step of obtaining evidence for the positive claim.  This is a God-of-the-Gaps move.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, although neither question is understood in sufficient detail, we have made substantial progress in understanding the &lt;a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/abioprob/"&gt;origin of life&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness#Scientific_study"&gt;origin of consciousness&lt;/a&gt;.  Far more progress than is made by assuming an agent simply created it.  We should avoid jumping to a positive claim without the evidence for that claim, and note our tendency to do just that in the face of mystery.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="religion"></category><category term="Unbelievable Project"></category><category term="religion"></category></entry><entry><title>Top Reasons for Belief</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2018/Mar/05/top-reasons-for-belief/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-03-05T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-03-05T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2018-03-05:/posts/2018/Mar/05/top-reasons-for-belief/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://www.premierchristianradio.com/Shows/Saturday/Unbelievable/"&gt;Unbelievable podcast&lt;/a&gt; episode &lt;a href="https://www.premierchristianradio.com/Shows/Saturday/Unbelievable/Episodes/Unbelievable-27-Oct-2007-Top-reasons-for-belief"&gt;27 Oct 2007 - Top reasons for belief&lt;/a&gt; there is a discussion around the results of a small survey of reasons for belief in God and …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://www.premierchristianradio.com/Shows/Saturday/Unbelievable/"&gt;Unbelievable podcast&lt;/a&gt; episode &lt;a href="https://www.premierchristianradio.com/Shows/Saturday/Unbelievable/Episodes/Unbelievable-27-Oct-2007-Top-reasons-for-belief"&gt;27 Oct 2007 - Top reasons for belief&lt;/a&gt; there is a discussion around the results of a small survey of reasons for belief in God and belief in Christianity specifically.  They discussed the tension between analytical justifications and those based on revelation or personal experience.  It was interesting that they never addressed the fact that personal experience is an unreliable way of determining the &lt;em&gt;truth&lt;/em&gt; of a proposition.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they did discuss reasons, the usual suspects came up - arguments from first cause, morality, and design.  I was however struck by the conviction that these arguments were basically unassailable.  For example, one Reverend summarized the first cause argument.  “Everything that begins to exist has a cause” - which he added “was a matter of logic and can be proved and thus is uncontroversial.”  He followed with “the universe began to exist.” to which he added “of course that’s true because the universe is here.”  He then expressed his admiration that this argument was written hundreds of years ago.  What I find interesting is not that someone would believe this argument, but that they would so uncritically accept it - the universe existing does not necessarily imply that it &lt;em&gt;began&lt;/em&gt; to exist.  Just because your common sense suggests that everything that begins to exist has a cause doesn’t mean that your common sense should hold for things outside of your own personal scale - things may be quite different and unintuitive on the scale of the very big or very small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discussion did mention the &lt;em&gt;practical&lt;/em&gt; benefit of Christian belief, in the specific case of forgiveness taking away bitterness.  This may in fact be true, but can’t one achieve this without believing all of the other parts?  I think so, but sometimes I wonder whether people need a form of narrative to structure their most fundamental beliefs - a human limitation perhaps - and that this narrative could be a requirement to get the levels of positive behaviors we’d like out of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Unbelievable Project"></category><category term="unbelievable"></category><category term="religion"></category></entry><entry><title>Getting the Definitions Right</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2018/Feb/18/getting-the-definitions-right/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-02-18T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-02-18T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2018-02-18:/posts/2018/Feb/18/getting-the-definitions-right/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I posted before about  &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/3-reasons-why-belief-in-god-makes-sense.html"&gt;3 Reasons Why Belief in God Makes Sense&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="https://www.premierchristianradio.com/Shows/Saturday/Unbelievable" title="Unbelievable Podcast"&gt;Unbelievable Podcast&lt;/a&gt;.

In &lt;a href="https://www.christiantoday.com/article/3-reasons-im-not-an-atheist-and-im-still-a-christian/111411.htm"&gt;another article&lt;/a&gt;, Justin Brierley comments on some of his observations as the moderator of atheist-theist debates.  Some of his observations, unfortunately, are wrong.   For example,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Almost every atheist I meet wears the spectacles of 'naturalism'. It's the view that there is no supernatural dimension to existence. All that really exists is physical matter in motion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sounds suspiciously like “philosophical naturalism”, to which I know of &lt;em&gt;no one&lt;/em&gt; who ascribes.  There is &lt;em&gt;“methodological naturalism”&lt;/em&gt; which simply states that we may assume, for the moment as a practical matter, that there isn’t a supernatural realm.  We’ll continue to assume that until someone can demonstrate the supernatural.  This isn’t as much wearing “spectacles of ‘naturalism’” but the only pragmatic choice an honest inquiry can support.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way to look at it is to notice that science evaluates &lt;em&gt;well-defined claims&lt;/em&gt;. We know of no method which can handle non-well-defined claims and we have yet to see a &lt;em&gt;definition&lt;/em&gt; of supernatural that is well defined.   Is there one?  Until someone puts forward something useful, we can proceed without including it in our descriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Consequently, there is no realm of right or wrong to be discovered in life, no overarching purpose to things, no ultimate meaning to reach for in the universe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is also possibly wrong, and I dealt with it in the &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/3-reasons-why-belief-in-god-makes-sense.html"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;.  Even if you’re not convinced of this argument, you have to admit there is - for some people - a reasonable argument for morality under naturalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When BBC broadcaster and atheist scientist Jim Al-Khalili came on my Unbelievable? show he acknowledged: 'It's a huge philosophical question: why does nature speak the language of mathematics?'. Nobel Prize winning physicist Eugene Wigner termed it 'the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics', describing it as a 'wonderful gift we neither understand nor deserve’.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Are we to simply say 'pass' on this question?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this is a necessary fact?  Perhaps there is an explanation, but we don’t have access to it?  God, however, is no explanation.  As Robert Price notes, you’re trying to explain unknown X with unknown double-X!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our belief in the intrinsic dignity and worth of human beings is best explained by Christianity. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights tapped into a foundational view of humanity established by our Judeo-Christian heritage, one which we jettison at our peril. Our belief in the intrinsic value of humanity can't be explained by atheism. But if we are made in the image of God, as Christianity claims, then that gives every human being inestimable value.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except, the Bible itself clearly delineates superior and inferior people!  It specifies, in great detail, how one should treat slavery depending on whether they are the chosen people or not.  Furthermore, Jesus - despite some of his better messages - never speaks against that and tacitly endorses it with the &lt;a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/5-18.htm"&gt;“not one jot of the law will be abolished”&lt;/a&gt; statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All-in-all I find Justin’s claims here, despite his good intentions, to be a testament to confirmation bias - which perhaps I am suffering from as well?

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;”No. I gave you that option already and it was declined. I want every exam in the country marked incorrect that has 999 as the correct answer."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took an attorney and another 3 months, but I got the result. My daughter scored the only 100 on the exam that year for her grade, not just in her class, but in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't care what it cost. I didn't care how much effort it took. I didn't care that an entire federal department was given tens of thousands of hours of work in addition to the demands placed on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…I was skeptical.  I then went to see when this would have happened - the article said that the events happened in 2008.  Was there any national standardized test in that year (plus or minus 1 year) which had their scores reduced by 1 question?  Not that I could confirm - and that would have made very big headlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without that, I looked into who the author is…his name is Ed Trice.  A quick google search brings us to &lt;a href="https://www.snopes.com/common-core-ed-trice-999/"&gt;Snopes&lt;/a&gt; which labels this story as “Unproven”.   Further searches has Ed Trice involved in a number of hoaxes and suspicious stories.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I read the story I really &lt;em&gt;wanted&lt;/em&gt; it to be true - perhaps that is the power of the story.  After learning that in all likelihood the story didn’t happen, I felt used and manipulated. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="critical thinking"></category></entry><entry><title>Your Lack of Imagination Can Kill You — But You Can Be Saved by Math</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2018/Feb/10/your-lack-of-imagination-can-kill-you-but-you-can-be-saved-by-math/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-02-10T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-02-10T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2018-02-10:/posts/2018/Feb/10/your-lack-of-imagination-can-kill-you-but-you-can-be-saved-by-math/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here I present how our cognitive biases -- confirmation bias, innumeracy, either-or bias -- can lead to significant problems, but also can be solved with the proper use of probability theory.

These reasons aren’t particularly compelling to me.  They are the following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="god-makes-sense-of-human-existence"&gt;God Makes Sense Of Human Existence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, Justin cites the Fine Tuning Argument, which has its best take-down in the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R97IHcuyWI0"&gt;Sean-Carroll/William Lane Craig debate&lt;/a&gt;.  It’s really an argument from physics, and the physics isn’t at all clear on whether the effect is there, or whether the interpretation of the effect is even reasonable.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="god-makes-sense-of-human-value"&gt;God Makes Sense Of Human Value&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, Justin states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why exactly do we believe that human life should be valued? Why did Jaime do the right thing – the human thing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find it very hard to come up with an answer on an atheistic world view. Why should humans have any more claim for special regard on the biological tree of life than a louse? There’s nothing intrinsically special about us in a universe that is blindly obeying the laws of nature. Any beliefs in objective human rights, values and morality are ultimately an illusion, a side-effect of our evolutionary history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I think &lt;a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/sam_harris_science_can_show_what_s_right"&gt;Sam Harris has the best word&lt;/a&gt; for this but &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq2C7fyVTA4"&gt;Matt Dillahunty also does quite well&lt;/a&gt; with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="god-makes-sense-of-human-purpose"&gt;God Makes Sense Of Human Purpose&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Justin states, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atheism and Christianity tell two very different stories – one is of ultimate purposelessness and the other is of ultimate hope. Hope that there is a reason for our existence, hope that our lives mean something, the hope that death is not the end. Is it a delusion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word “purpose” I think is a little less defined than I’d like, but it seems that if heaven exists then there really is no purpose for this life.  I am also not convinced that purpose requires an infinite time - that if you exist for a finite time then you can have purpose.  It may also be the case that there is no purpose - but how we feel about that should have no effect on the truth.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="religion"></category></entry><entry><title>Facts are Not Enough</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2018/Feb/05/facts-are-not-enough/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-02-05T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-02-05T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2018-02-05:/posts/2018/Feb/05/facts-are-not-enough/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the October issue of Significance magazine, an article called &lt;a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2017.01066.x/full"&gt;“Why facts are not enough in the fight against fake news”&lt;/a&gt; by Brian Tarran resonated with some of the things …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the October issue of Significance magazine, an article called &lt;a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2017.01066.x/full"&gt;“Why facts are not enough in the fight against fake news”&lt;/a&gt; by Brian Tarran resonated with some of the things I have been thinking.  A few quotes are useful here,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But fake news also satisfies another need: serving up stories that people either &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; to be true, even if the facts say otherwise.  This appeal to emotion is a central component of the post-truth phenomenon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Post-truth is a very specific and very twenty-first century problem, which is where emotion trumps factual assessment and evidence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“…bombarding people with facts is not enough, and that the answer to fake news is to wrap our response to it in an emotionalism that does not compromise factual accuracy, but acknowledges that the way in which people respond to information has changed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“”…we have to always have a mixture of telling people’s human stories while at the same time giving context to those stories and giving the real facts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading this, I am immediately reminded of a few things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The book &lt;em&gt;Don't Be Such a Scientist: Talking Substance in an Age of Style&lt;/em&gt; by Randy Olson, which outlines the importance of using &lt;em&gt;stories&lt;/em&gt; to communicate science, and that we lose the public when we don’t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The TV series Cosmos, with Carl Sagan, where he did just that - used stories and visualization to convey the emotional impact of science.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interviews with Scott Adams, a professed Trump supporter, who refers to Trump as the “Master Persuader”.  Don’t believe me?  Listen to his &lt;a href="https://theartofcharm.com/podcast-episodes/scott-adams-master-persuader-episode-605/"&gt;interview on the Art of Charm podcast&lt;/a&gt;.  His point as I read it is that Trump is very good at providing visually and emotionally engaging points, despite the facts, to build solidarity in the base and to disarm his opponents.  This is the epitome of  the post-truth culture.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good Things Are A Dime-A-Dozen&lt;/strong&gt;.  For me, passively watching a movie with my kids is good. However, actively engaging with them---whether playing games, laughing, playing out in the yard---is better.
*The problem with doing good things is that they are easy to justify, because they are inherently good. But, as Jim Collins, author of Good To Great, has said, "Good is the enemy of great. Few people attain great lives, in large part because it is just so easy to settle for a good life."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Always Take The Higher Road&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the alarm clock goes off , do you push snooze or get up? When you're with your spouse, do you compliment or criticize? Do you listen, or must you always speak?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be Who You Ideally Want To Become, Today&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As Bill Walsh has said, "Winners act like winners before they become winners." That's how they become "winners."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take time to write down your core values and goals.&lt;/li&gt;

However, even physicists have in their models certain entities which cannot be categorized as either matter or energy. The quantum wavefunction is one clear example. There is also a history of introducing entities into models which later turn out to be unnecessary - "Vis viva" (i.e. life force), "phlogiston" (i.e. heat fluid), and "celestial matter" (vs terrestial matter). It is not that scientists are dogmatically against such entities, it's just that they should be dropped when they don't explain and predict anything or alternative explanations are simpler and more direct. We don't use agency to explain the motion of the planets anymore, for example, but we once did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other entities in models which serve as placeholders for the unknown, for example "dark matter". No one seriously thinks labeling the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_rotation_curve"&gt;gravitational effect observed from galactic rotation curves&lt;/a&gt; is better understood once we label it "dark matter". It is just a placeholder, until we figure out what dark matter actually is - neutrinos, black holes, altered gravitation on large scale, etc...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given this backdrop, what explanative and predictive power do the terms "spirit" and "supernatural agency" have anymore? Can we name anything that we understand better with their inclusion than we do without? What direct observations make these entities useful in any model of the universe, beyond as a placeholder for the unknown?  &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="religion"></category></entry><entry><title>Cool theorem - angle bisector</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2018/Jan/29/cool-theorem-angle-bisector/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-01-29T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-01-29T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2018-01-29:/posts/2018/Jan/29/cool-theorem-angle-bisector/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was helping my daughter with geometry the other day and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_bisector_theorem"&gt;this cute theorem popped up in the examples&lt;/a&gt;.

Such quotes as "&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalism_(philosophy)"&gt;Naturalism&lt;/a&gt; is ambiguous. What is nature and what isn't nature?", "Naturalism is vacuous. It's only tenet is an entirely reactionary one - no theology", and "Naturalism is unable to ground its own intelligibility which means it collapses into nihilism" abound.  Philosopher  Alvin Plantinga has an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_argument_against_naturalism"&gt;Evolutionary argument against naturalism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way I see it is the following.  There used to be a distinction between "terrestrial" and "celestial" matter. Then it was determined that the planets obeyed the same rules as the apples falling from trees and the need for the distinction disappeared. "Celestial" matter disappeared as did "terrestrial" matter leaving just "matter". Since then, we have determined, that pretty much everything we can observe follows the same rules - although some get blurred at different scales (microscopic vs macroscopic, for example). Naturalism then is simply the recognition that the stuff we see day-to-day operates on the same principles as the stars in the early universe, and the galaxies far far away. So if you can show us something that is observable yet doesn't follow these rules - something which follows a separate set of rules - then perhaps it might be time to introduce the distinction between natural and supernatural. Otherwise, there is no need for the added concept of the supernatural. Is there such an observable? What are its rules?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a side-note, this means that naturalism need not "ground its own intelligibility". It is just the recognition that we can develop rules using the material on the Earth and make predictions over a wide range of time and space. There really isn't anything more we could ask of it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="religion"></category></entry><entry><title>Lessons from Jon Acuff's book Finish</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2018/Jan/17/lessons-from-jon-acuffs-book-finish/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-01-17T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-01-17T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2018-01-17:/posts/2018/Jan/17/lessons-from-jon-acuffs-book-finish/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here are the lessons I learned from &lt;a href="https://acuff.me/books/"&gt;Jon Acuff's book &lt;em&gt;Finish&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Choose what to bomb&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what gives?  something will, and that's ok.  it's called "seasons".  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;just say "no"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;simplify&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make it fun if you want it done&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;give yourself rewards.  This is also in "The Power of Habit"&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;get rid of secret rules&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid rules like "I'm not a ...."&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;other ideas creep in - write them down for later, and don't let them derail you.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3 id="the-list"&gt;The List&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a list of some of the resources
* &lt;a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/"&gt;GTD (Getting things done)&lt;/a&gt; - this is perhaps the universal "To Do" methodology.  Most people seem to have a love/hate relationship with this method.
* &lt;a href="https://zenhabits.net/zen-to-done-ztd-the-ultimate-simple-productivity-system/"&gt;Zen to Done&lt;/a&gt; - a simplification of the GTD method.
* &lt;a href="https://12weekyear.com/"&gt;12 Week Year&lt;/a&gt;
* &lt;a href="https://acuff.me/books/"&gt;Finish by Jon Acuff&lt;/a&gt;
* &lt;a href="https://theartofcharm.com/"&gt;The Art of Charm Podcast&lt;/a&gt;
* &lt;a href="http://www.asianefficiency.com/podcast/"&gt;The Productivity Show&lt;/a&gt; - excellent, specific advice on productivity
* &lt;a href="http://productivity-podcast.com/"&gt;Kevin Kruse - Extreme Productivity&lt;/a&gt; - podcast seems to be over, but binge listen to this!
* &lt;a href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/pomodoro-technique.htm"&gt;Pomodoro technique&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-takeaway"&gt;The Takeaway&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The filing system for resource materials described in GTD is golden. Basically, just alphabetically, one folder per letter.  Doesn't matter whether you are filing "pet alligators" with "asthma paper" because you know close to where you need to look (e.g. is "asthma" under "asthma" or "medical"?).  There usually isnt so much to look through that it takes long to find, and you &lt;strong&gt;simplify the filing so that you're more likely to do it&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The "2-minute rule" from GTD and zTD.  If it would take more less than 2 minutes to do, do it right now.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To-do's should be &lt;em&gt;actions&lt;/em&gt; not &lt;em&gt;nouns&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose your MIT (Most Important Todos) each day - 3 of them - and get them done first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it is important to do, &lt;strong&gt;put it on your calendar&lt;/strong&gt;, in 15 minute blocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pomodoro rocks!  25 minutes, for me, seems to be a good time-period for getting a single non-trivial thing done.  Trivial things (like email) can be done in 15 minute blocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put "check email" on calendar, only for 2 specific times a day and don't look at it otherwise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Actually, beyond that, I am a &lt;em&gt;productivity method&lt;/em&gt; junkie. Of course, I recognize that in doing so I often make myself &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; productive.  Still it's a hard interest to shake.  Further, I find that when I switch to-do apps it makes it easier to throw out all kinds of items which I wasn't going to do anyway.  So I feel like I get a burst of productivity simply by switching to-do apps every 6 months to a year.  Here is a short list of the to-do apps I have tried, and some quick comments on them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.todoist.com/"&gt;Todoist&lt;/a&gt; (current app) - good free app, but the premium is worth it.  I haven't used it for sharing to-do's but it has a clean interface and I can have it on my phone, mac, and windows tablet.  You need to pay for some features that Wunderlist has in the free - like reminders, comments, and attachments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wunderlist.com/"&gt;Wunderlist&lt;/a&gt; (former app) - nice free app, but seems to be aging a bit and there is no future support for it.  Microsoft hopes to replace it with their own To Do app. Doesn't archive projects at all (you have to delete them!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/"&gt;Things&lt;/a&gt; - a solid app, but mac/iphone only - and expensive!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://ticktick.com/"&gt;Tick-tick&lt;/a&gt; (as of June 2017) - maximum of 9 lists or go pro with $25/mo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://asana.com/"&gt;Asana&lt;/a&gt; - looks interesting, but perhaps overkill as a to-do app - more for teams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also tried, and rejected for various reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firetask&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Todo Pro&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Astrid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taskpaper - nice idea for text-based to-dos, but a bit fragile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OmniFocus - complete, huge learning curve, and quite pricey.  overkill for most of the things I need a to-do app to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, I am going to try out an analog solution &lt;a href="http://bulletjournal.com/"&gt;with bullet journal&lt;/a&gt;, once I figure out how it works.

It is also important to recognize that people can have nuanced views on complex subjects. Calling someone a denier when they have such views is not constructive.  For example, from &lt;a href="http://judithcurry.com/2015/04/28/making-nonsense-of-climate-denial/"&gt;"Making (non)sense of climate denial"&lt;/a&gt; we have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists agree that surface temperatures have increased since 1880, humans are adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, and carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases have a warming effect on the planet. However there is considerable disagreement about the most consequential issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whether the warming since 1950 has been dominated by human causes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much the planet will warm in the 21st century&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whether warming is ‘dangerous’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems pretty reasonable to me, and is basically the view that I have.  I have seen a lot of overblown attribution to climate (e.g. polar bears, more frequent hurricanes, more intense tornadoes, etc...).  On the other hand, I've heard some ridiculous anti-climate change statements (e.g. it's cold outside now in New England therefore no climate change; people couldn't possible be influential enough to change the climate).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must be vigilant to explore each claim, evaluate it on its own, and come closer to the truth which may indeed be messy.  We need to be open to messy, nuanced positions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="science"></category></entry><entry><title>Art, Scientific Reductionism, and the New Neuroscience</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2018/Jan/10/art-scientific-reductionism-and-the-new-neuroscience/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-01-10T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-01-10T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2018-01-10:/posts/2018/Jan/10/art-scientific-reductionism-and-the-new-neuroscience/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an &lt;a href="http://chronicle.com/article/How-Art-Reveals-the-Limits-of/232821/?cid=cr&amp;amp;utm_source=cr&amp;amp;utm_medium=en"&gt;article in the Chronicle of Higher Education&lt;/a&gt;, Alva Noë challenges the neuroscience paradigm, summarized as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The momentous proposition is this: Every thought, feeling, experience, impression, value, argument, emotion, attitude, inclination, belief, desire, and ambition is in your brain. We may not know how the brain manages this feat, but, so it is said, we are beginning to understand. And this new knowledge — of how the organization of bits of matter inside your head can be your personality, thoughts, understanding, wonderings, religious or sexual impulses — is surely among the most exciting and important in all of science, or so it is claimed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He believes art doesn't follow this model,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a work of art, like the meaningful world around us, is not a mere stimulus. And we work hard — we look, we ask, we think, we collaborate — to bring art and world into focus for consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then critiques neuroscience as claiming that the picture and the object are the same,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The equivalency of a picture and what it depicts, however, is deeply implausible.[...]You may see a woman in the statuette. But you are not in the same state you would be in if you were in the presence of an actual woman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He continues exploring aesthetics, point out&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aesthetic responses are not fixed data points but are rather like positions staked out in a conversation, continuing in our day, our lives, and in the historical time of our culture. Aesthetic responses are cultivated and nourished, and they are also challenged. Encountering a work of art is more like an evening with a friend, or an afternoon at work, than it is like the transient relishing of a flavor. Aesthetic responses are also sometimes questions that the art poses to us rather than definitive answers; they are beginnings, opportunities, not data points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aesthetic responses, then, are not symptoms or reactions or stable quantities. They are actions. They are modes of participation. They are moments of conversation. There is nothing about which we can even ask: What are its neural correlates? And moreover, to look for neural correlates is already to have turned away from what deserves to be called aesthetic experience, for it is to have turned away from art and toward mere synaptic goings-on inside us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="response"&gt;Response&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was reading this article, I was immediately struck by how limiting the author sees neuroscience.  The "equivalency of a picture and what it depicts" is pretty silly - there is obviously a distinction both in and outside of the brain.  We can tell the difference between a picture of an object and the object itself because internally there is a neural model which represents the object in all of the features we've experienced about the object.  This neural model is activated when a sufficient number of its properties are activated - which may be associations from other areas.  Seeing the 2D representation of a sculpture results in the neural model becoming active; seeing the 3D object as we walk around it also results in the neural model becoming active, perhaps even more strongly and with more associations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article also fails to include multiple modalities.  It is true that you can get visual responses from art, but even going to a museum to see paintings provides a more rich neural representation including smells, alternate visual angles, connections to stories about the piece, etc...  Even within the paradigm of neural models, nothing in the experience of art is inconsistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of aesthetic responses as "actions" and "moments of conversation" is entirely consistent with the language of neural correlates.  It's just an admission that most of our experience is an interplay between internal models and actions driven by the brain's representation in such a complex fashion that we can't easily summarize it.  Scientifically, we can choose to isolate certain modalities - vision alone, for example - in order to understand pieces of it.  The scientists aren't assuming that's all there is, but it may be all that can be described at this time - at least in quantitative detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be a very interesting research project to see how the visual system is modified by learning in other areas.  Do people actually &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; art differently when they know the context or is the visual system doing the same thing in both cases but the increased aesthetic response comes from the interaction of multiple brain areas?  Far from eliminating the language of neuroscience, we should wholeheartedly embrace it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="science"></category></entry><entry><title>Happy New Year (again)!</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2018/Jan/08/happy-new-year-again/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-01-08T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-01-08T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2018-01-08:/posts/2018/Jan/08/happy-new-year-again/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2016/Jan/01/happy-new-year/"&gt;I have written before&lt;/a&gt;, I love the idea of New Year’s Day.

It’s a time for reflection, contemplation, self improvement.  I realize that it is technically just another day and just another year, and that one could definitely have any day in the year serve this role, but there still feels like something special for this day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, I want to focus on writing.  My hope is to be able to write 300 words a day - that’s only a page of text.  But if I can do it every day, that’s a book! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which didn't quite get done.  I did write more, but I couldn't keep the pace up consistently.  I plan to do a bit better this year, at least as an improvement.  My goal is to write on this blog 5 times a week.  Some may be pretty short, but I am motivated by the Art of Charm toolbox podcast episode &lt;a href="https://theartofcharm.com/podcast-episodes/aoc-toolbox-quality-want-focus-quantity-episode-683/"&gt;If Quality Is What You Want, Focus on Quantity (Episode 683)&lt;/a&gt;.

We start with &lt;a href="http://www.saintsandsceptics.org/extraordinary-claims-do-not-require-extraordinary-evidence/"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; which maintains that extraordinary claims do not require extraordinary evidence. They make the analogy with a story about a vet claiming that a chicken gave birth to a chick internally, without laying the egg.  The author states that he believes this claim, despite the meager evidence, because "this is the sort of evidence that I’d expect if the claim is true and not at all what I’d expect if the claim is false."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a skeptic, I thought "well, that's unusual" but am also inclined to believe it - although not particularly strongly.  Why? And does this undermine my skepticism for other extraordinary claims?  Here are five reasons for why I believe the claim (but not strongly) and why it is different than many other extraordinary claims:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we have the word of a trained scientist, who'd be in the position to tell the difference between a hoax and something legitimate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we understand that the biological mechanisms of birth are stochastic, and this sort of thing is totally within the possibility of the biology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it led to the death of the hen, which is the most likely outcome in such a rare case&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;although the prior probability of such a thing happening is small, we have &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; chickens in the world.  It's like winning the lottery twice - it happens frequently because there are so many people playing lotteries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm still a little dubious, because I can't find any other corroboration, and the story is sensational enough to warrant making it up, so I wouldn't stake my life on the story.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe a probability of about 80 percent?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, ask yourself, other than point (5), do we have for any ancient miracles, or for that matter any other supernatural claims, an analogous match to any of the points 1-4?  &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="articles"></category></entry><entry><title>Do Skeptics Underestimate the Case for the Resurrection?</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2017/Jun/07/do-skeptics-underestimate-the-case-for-the-resurrection/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-06-07T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-06-07T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2017-06-07:/posts/2017/Jun/07/do-skeptics-underestimate-the-case-for-the-resurrection/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As someone who is skeptical of the resurrection myself, I am not particularly impressed when someone finds it “extremely difficult to deal with as a critic”.  It really isn’t all that hard.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here's a post that has been brewing for quite a while and never really made it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blake Giunta is up to his usual philosophizing over at &lt;a href="https://beliefmap.org"&gt;BeliefMap&lt;/a&gt; with a short article on &lt;a href="https://beliefmap.org/jesus-resurrected/#underestimated"&gt;“Skeptics tend to underestimate the case”&lt;/a&gt;.  The argument seems to fall into two parts.  The first part quote two so-called atheists claiming that the case for the resurrection was surprisingly good or hard to refute, even if they do not find it personally compelling.  The second part is a quote from William Lane Craig, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man"&gt;strawmanning&lt;/a&gt; an argument he had with an atheist, and stating that his opponent “could not deny the facts of Jesus’s honorable burial, his empty tomb, his post-mortem appearances, and the origin of the disciples’ belief in his resurrection.”  Giunta ends with an invitation, “Why not explore the case for Jesus's resurrection yourself?”, perhaps getting closer to God in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone who is skeptical of the resurrection myself, I am not particularly impressed when someone finds it “extremely difficult to deal with as a critic”.  It really isn’t all that hard.  So, the first part of the argument doesn’t hold much water - and I think it is probably a rare case that well-informed skeptics find it hard to dismiss the claims of the resurrection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-argument"&gt;The argument&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strongest argument for resurrection definitely comes in the form that William Lane Craig proposes, sometimes referred to as the minimal facts approach.  In this approach a core handful of claims are supposedly supported even by secular scholars, and that this core inevitably leads directly to supporting the resurrection.  Different people have somewhat different lists of these minimal facts, but Craig summarizes them neatly as “Jesus’s honorable burial, his empty tomb, his post-mortem appearances, and the origin of the disciples’ belief in his resurrection”.  A complete take-down of this approach is found in Matthew Ferguson’s excellent article &lt;a href="https://adversusapologetica.wordpress.com/2013/06/29/knocking-out-the-pillars-of-the-minimal-facts-apologetic/"&gt;Knocking Out the Pillars of the “Minimal Facts” Apologetic&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an immediate rejoinder to the minimal facts approach is the fact that Paul, the earliest Christian writer, doesn’t mention most of them - the honorable burial or the empty tomb.  Paul also uses the same word for Jesus "appearing" to Peter and James as to "appearing" to himself, which calls into question whether these were actual visitations or just visions, clearly not requiring an empty tomb or any other details of the crucifixion.  Further, Paul never talks about any post-resurrection &lt;em&gt;stories&lt;/em&gt;, only &lt;em&gt;visions&lt;/em&gt;.  This, too, doesn’t lend any support to the minimal facts argument because a big part of the post-resurrection appearances are in the stories.  If the stories aren’t true then the appearances are called into question too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing to consider is that if this line of logic were applied to, say, the Roswell Incident it would be quite easy to argue for alien visitation.  Given the rarity of alien visitations, as well as supernatural resurrection, I will need more than a few claims about tombs and visions to convince me that something extraordinary occurred. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="articles"></category></entry><entry><title>Twitter, Zombies, and the Fate of the World</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2017/Mar/31/twitter-zombies-and-the-fate-of-the-world/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-03-31T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-03-31T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2017-03-31:/posts/2017/Mar/31/twitter-zombies-and-the-fate-of-the-world/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://web.bryant.edu/~bblais/pdf/Twitter Zombies and the Fate of the World.pdf"&gt;Twitter, Zombies, and the Fate of the World&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is my presentation today at the &lt;a href="http://www.bentley.edu/analytics-without-borders"&gt;Analytics without Borders Conference&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dynamical systems are mathematical constructions containing multiple interacting parts which vary in time. This can include physical systems such as those in astronomy or systems of interacting behaviors like those found in economics. Here we present some recent work combining the dynamical systems approach to several problems, including the spread of ideas on Twitter and the spread of zombie infections, with the statistical methods of Bayesian parameter estimation. We will also present a how-to guide to using these examples in a classroom setting, appropriate for undergraduate students and for the communication of those ideas to the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a simple website which claims to read your mind:  the &lt;a href="http://www.flashlightcreative.net/swf/mindreader/"&gt;Flash Mind Reader&lt;/a&gt;!  This is a pretty extraordinary claim, so I would want extraordinary evidence.  It's a nice exercise in evaluating claims.  First, we ask, &lt;em&gt;does it do what it specifically claims to do, regardless of interpretation?&lt;/em&gt;.  On the site, it asks you to think of a two-digit number, then do some basic math on it to get another number, which you then look up on a table.  The table associates the final number with a symbol, and it is that symbol which the "Mind Reader" determines.  So regardless of whether the interpretation is a psychic process, or some mundane process, does the process work as claimed?  In many extraordinary claims of this sort, the claimant fails even at this preliminary step.  This is well documented at the &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/1m-challenge/challenge-faq.html"&gt;JREF Challenge&lt;/a&gt; site.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in the case of the &lt;a href="http://www.flashlightcreative.net/swf/mindreader/"&gt;Flash Mind Reader&lt;/a&gt;, the process does seem to work!  Okay, then the next step kicks in.  How many ways can we think of this thing to work, and can we test them?  Is it &lt;em&gt;overly skeptical&lt;/em&gt; to not consider mind-reading in that list?  I don't think so, but we could probably come up with some tests even there.  For example, would it work done on a group of people all at once?  If it did, that would certainly count &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; mind reading.  Here are a few ways that I initially thought it could work, and I could quickly discount them by looking at the table, or trying it a few times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;does the calculation lead to the same number each time?  No!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is it the same symbol each time you run it?  No!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do all the numbers have the same symbol?  No!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a little imagination, one can come up with a probable explanation that does not involve telepathy, but it is a nice recreation of the way a scientist would address &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; claim, extraordinary or not.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="articles"></category></entry><entry><title>Do we really need algebra 2 and calculus?</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2017/Mar/17/do-we-really-need-algebra-2-and-calculus/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-03-17T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-03-17T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2017-03-17:/posts/2017/Mar/17/do-we-really-need-algebra-2-and-calculus/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;From time to time I hear proposals to restructure math or science secondary education.

&lt;p&gt;According to evolutionary biologists, once life got started, Darwinian evolution took over and eventually produced the grand diversity we observe today. Under the standard view, a process of random mutation and natural selection built life's vast complexity one small mutational step at a time. All of life's complex features, of course, are thought to be encoded in the DNA of living organisms. Building new features thus requires generating new information in the genetic code of DNA. Can the necessary information be generated in the undirected, step-by-step manner required by Darwin's theory?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They then comment on some possible issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when multiple mutations must be present simultaneously to gain a functional advantage, Darwinian evolution gets stuck. As Behe explains, "If more than one [mutation] is needed, the probability of getting all the right ones grows exponentially worse."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And continuing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behe, a professor of biochemistry at Lehigh University, coined the term &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreducible_complexity"&gt;"irreducible complexity"&lt;/a&gt; to describe systems which require many parts -- and thus many mutations -- to be present -- all at once -- before providing any survival advantage to the organism. According to Behe, such systems cannot evolve in the step-by-step fashion required by Darwinian evolution. (Wikipedia link added)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darwin himself raised the issue, &lt;em&gt;"If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down. But I can find out no such case."&lt;/em&gt;  So the challenge being raised is a legitimate one - but one that requires the demonstration that such an irreducibly complex system actually exists.  As far as I've ever read, every case has failed.  For example, the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreducible_complexity#Flagella"&gt;bacteria flagellum&lt;/a&gt; mechanism, it is claimed, is so complex that it can't function without any of it's pieces.  It fails as a motor if any of the pieces are missing, so the argument goes.  However, what is commonly overlooked is that the theory of evolution merely states that the pieces have to have &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; function possibly (likely?) a &lt;em&gt;different function&lt;/em&gt; for selection to work.  Despite this fact, you don't see it mentioned in the discussion on flagellum in the original article, nor have I ever seen it mentioned in any critique on evolution.  That omission I think is fairly telling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the problem as phrased is also misleading -- mutations aren't the driver of the "Genetic Information Required for Irreducibly Complex Structures".  The &lt;em&gt;selection process&lt;/em&gt; is the driver.  The mutations are random, but the information comes from the environment. Imagine taking a million lions and dropping them randomly over the earth.  Three quarters of them will drown in the oceans, another large fraction will die of cold or of heat. Only a small fraction will survive. The process that leads to their survival or not is &lt;em&gt;completely non-random&lt;/em&gt; even while the locations of each lion is completely random.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot to respond to in this article, even this one section, but this is a start.  I'll keep chipping away at it because each piece of it leads to a lot of external reading.  &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="articles"></category></entry><entry><title>Philosophy of science and the burden of proof</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2017/Mar/03/philosophy-of-science-and-the-burden-of-proof/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-03-03T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2017-03-03T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2017-03-03:/posts/2017/Mar/03/philosophy-of-science-and-the-burden-of-proof/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was just reminded about the difference between philosophy and science.

I've written about this topic before &lt;a href="{filename}atheism_belief.md"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2016/Jan/11/philosophy-and-science/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  This particular reminder came in the form of Blake Giunta's challenge to the argument from "divine hiddenness" as stated in the &lt;a href="https://www.premierchristianradio.com/Shows/Saturday/Unbelievable/Episodes/Unbelievable-Why-is-God-hidden-Justin-Schieber-and-Blake-Giunta"&gt;Unbelievable Podcast episode&lt;/a&gt;. A very detailed summary of the argument and the counterargument can be found on the &lt;a href="https://beliefmap.org/god-exists/divine-hiddenness/"&gt;beliefmap website&lt;/a&gt;. Essentially the main argument goes that a loving God who wants to be in a personal relationship with the subjects he creates would not then choose to be hidden from anyone who is non-resistant. Thus the existence of anyone willing to be in relationship with God, but isn't, demonstrates that God doesn't exist.  The challenge from Blake Giunta, broken up into many different parts in categories, is essentially that God may have reasons to hide if there's a greater good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And further Blake will say that the atheist must defeat all of these possible exceptions -- show that they are all impossible -- in order to defeat his challenge. When he said this in the interview, it really struck me as shifting the burden of proof. However, he is technically correct.  In a philosophical argument where you were trying to &lt;em&gt;prove&lt;/em&gt; something you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; you have to demonstrate that possible counter arguments are in fact impossible. But this isn't how we gain knowledge in the world. I've &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Jan/21/philosophy-and-science-whats-the-difference/"&gt;written about this before&lt;/a&gt; but I don't think that philosophy can produce new knowledge of things in the world.  With philosophy, I can point out the possible contradictions in certain types of statements but I can never demonstrate the existence of a particular thing or phenomenon. We need science for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the original argument really should be recast in probabilistic terms. Given the properties of God, namely his infinite love and justice, it is supremely &lt;em&gt;unlikely&lt;/em&gt; that he would hide himself from so many nonresistant people. Further, it would be highly &lt;em&gt;unlikely&lt;/em&gt; that, for the people who already believe in him, he wouldn't choose to be absolutely obvious. Instead, even most believers admit that the actions of God in their life -- although sometimes seemingly palpable -- are very hard to distinguish from their own thoughts or their projections onto events. Mysterious ways.  This seems unlikely in the face of an all-loving God that wants to be a relationship with his subjects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recasting the argument in probabilistic terms modifies Blake's challenge.  When he says that "maybe God has some reason for hiding" you can turn it  around and simply ask "what evidence do you actually have that he's there and hiding?" or "what evidence do you have that these reasons for hiding are in fact salient?" Yes it's &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; that God is hiding for some reasons but how have you demonstrated that these reasons are likely?  One can make all sorts of excuses about why it's &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; God would be hidden, but the reality is that God's actions are definitely hidden and, at best, this does not suggest the existence of a loving God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The burden of proof needs to land squarely on the person making claims about God's motivations, and providing evidence of his existence in the first place.  It is not the role of the skeptic to have to disprove every possible excuse the philosopher imagines, which is why the argument is much more useful in probabilistic rather than philosophical terms.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="articles"></category></entry><entry><title>Climate Change</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2017/Feb/17/climate-change/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-02-17T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2017-02-17T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2017-02-17:/posts/2017/Feb/17/climate-change/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In this post, I am reacting to a very interesting and well researched post &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@pullnews/what-i-learned-about-climate-change-the-science-is-not-settled-1e3ae4712ace"&gt;where a liberal argues that the climate science is not as settled as we hear&lt;/a&gt;.

I agree with many points and am critical of other points.  The overall message I think is a good one, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a lot to go through so my initial thoughts may be a bit scattered as I go through pieces of this document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start with some critique.  The argument that temperature causes CO$_2$ to increase in the past and not vice versa is a pretty terrible argument. The physics is known - they each influence each other. In the past it has been temperature that has changed due to the orbital changes, and that consequently drove increases in CO$_2$.   But you can just as easily change CO$_2$ directly as in burning fossil fuels and affect temperature. It's not an either-or situation so this argument is misleading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for whether the earth was warmer a thousand years ago, I am somewhat agnostic. The tree ring data and other proxy data in my view is &lt;em&gt;extremely noisy&lt;/em&gt; and hard to make concrete conclusions. So the uncertainty around the medieval warming period is something to be concerned about.  If it was warmer 500-1000 years ago, many of the stronger claims, about climate change and how unusual the modern time period is, collapse.  The statistical arguments that lead to the hockey stick are not convincing to me and are vulnerable to confirmation bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solar connection to temperature is weaker than what the author presents here. The recent inactive sun should have led to an actual cooling not a leveling off if the solar connection was really as strong as they are saying in this article. The correlation is really somewhat weak especially in modern times.  It's still there, though, and needs to be dealt with but it is in fact dealt with in many, if not all, of the models already so this is not a strong argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing where I agree with the article concerns a number of the predictions that have been made in the past concerning global warming.  Many have not really come to fruition. Things like the polar bear population dropping and the increase in hurricanes and tornadoes are examples of this. These just haven't turned out to be the case. In addition, it happens that more people die from cold spells than do from hot spells which means there is at least one &lt;em&gt;benefit&lt;/em&gt; of global warming (and there may be more).  I'm not saying that it is necessarily a good thing when the climate changes or that it is overall a benefit that we are affecting the climate with our behavior.  However one has to look at both the costs and the benefits of any change when trying to assess what to do about it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find many environmentalists, although well-meaning, are one-sided and do not look for the benefits of a perceived problem. The best example I can think of is pollution. What are the costs and benefits of pollution? Environmentalists are quick to point out the costs - namely the health damages. They are not so keen on pointing out the benefits. In fact if you ask an environmentalist what the benefits of pollution are they will often look offended as if the answer is obvious… None!  I'll admit that when I first heard that phrase from an economist it was a little puzzling until it was explained that the meaning of the phrase "benefit of pollution" is what is the "benefit of the thing that is giving you the pollution". So if you look at cars for example we can see that the air pollution the cars give us has a cost - the pollution's impact on health and property - but it also has some clear benefits, even for health. Namely, with cars it is easier to access healthcare, there are more rapid transportation options than with horses, etc... Ironically the advent of cars while increasing air pollution, also produced a huge reduction in &lt;em&gt;water pollution&lt;/em&gt; due to the reduction in animal carcasses (especially in cities) and the fertilizer used for animal feed. In the same way there are both costs and benefits of climate change and we need to be clear about which they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Arctic ice dynamics do seem to be decreasing although the Antarctic ice seems to be increasing somewhat. Some of the predicted consequences have been overblown, however.  The fact that polar bears for example, have been around for 200000 years and there have been ice free times in the arctic it during that time means that ice cover alone does not drive polar bear population declines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"According to Bob Tisdale, a researcher I respect after reading his book Climate Models Fail, the IPCC models simply aren’t skillful. They failed to predict the past twenty years, they don’t realistically model the cloud response, and there is simply too much uncertainty about the inputs to get decent outputs."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wholeheartedly agree with this paragraph. The reason the "pause" is called the "pause" is because &lt;em&gt;none of the models predicted it&lt;/em&gt;, even if you see it as a couple-decades long variation in the overall increase, none of the models predicted it. It lies outside of the uncertainty range given for these models. This just shows that the models have a great deal of uncertainty which is not accurately characterized. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest place where uncertainty plays a role it seems is in the climate sensitivity.  Namely how much should we expect the temperature to change given an increase in carbon dioxide, given all of the Earth feedbacks (both positive and negative feedbacks). It seems as if most of the estimates that are done for theoretical reasons disagree with those empirically measured and always in the same direction - the theory predicts a bigger sensitivity than observed.  This means that the climate sensitivity assumed in the models doesn't match the actually measured climate sensitivity.  There is still a lot of uncertainty in this topic, mostly due to potential negative feedbacks like cloud cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"we should switch to renewable sources of energy, but for the right reasons at the right price."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with this entirely. While it may be the case that carbon dioxide is causing climate change, the uncertainty surrounding the issue makes it a harder sell in my opinion than, for example, reducing fossil-fuel use for national security. If we can wean ourselves off of fossil fuels then we might be able to remove ourselves politically from those struggles in the Middle East that seem to cause so much grief. Unfortunately the only long-term solution is nuclear power which is another discussion altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The section of the article which describes whom you should trust and whom you shouldn't trust smacks to me of conspiracy-theory thinking. I think you should look at &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the data and look at competing views and see for yourself on particular issues which side seems to be making more sense. Which side posts the data, and the analysis, so that you can reproduce it? What are the types of criticisms and counter arguments are presented?  Look for cherry-picking and ad hominem attacks as a sign of a bad argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with most of the skepticism the author communicates and with his recommendations for reading the "protagonist" side, as he calls them. People like Judith Curry and Steve McIntyre, for example. However he includes people like Michael Crichton, whose novel discussing climate change is really an exercise in cherry picking. We go through the actual data in a classroom exercise and the pattern is pretty clear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, look at all sides of an argument, examine the evidence, and look at the arguments.  In addition, try to go in assuming that people intend the best - make the most charitable reading, and avoid attributing motives to the side you disagree with.  On any complex issue, those that disagree with you are probably right on some level no matter what side of the argument they are on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I want to add that I can be convinced of any reasonable position - just present the evidence.  So please do!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="articles"></category></entry><entry><title>Free Will On My Mind</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2017/Jan/27/free-will-on-my-mind/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-01-27T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2017-01-27T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2017-01-27:/posts/2017/Jan/27/free-will-on-my-mind/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Usually when thinking about free will my thoughts run in circles.

In summary we have different levels of description. Footballs for example are not in the fundamental laws of physics but that doesn't make footballs any less real - they are an emergent phenomenon. It also doesn't make the word &lt;em&gt;football&lt;/em&gt; any less useful in describing the world at the level of human interactions.  The problem occurs when you try to mix levels of description.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key idea with free will, as described by Sean Carroll, is that we live in a world where uncertainty dominates.  As a result, the fact that the universe is deterministic is irrelevant when describing human behavior - we simply don't have daily, practical access to that determinism.  Free will, then, is a useful construct when discussing agency just as footballs are a useful concept when describing Sunday behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

I agree with this, and think that this is another concept which is improved by mapping it onto probability theory.  For "worldview" read "prior probabilities for the models under consideration" and it becomes clear.  Further, ones &lt;em&gt;prior&lt;/em&gt; probability for a claim is just the &lt;em&gt;posterior&lt;/em&gt; probability, given all of the evidence you've seen in the past.  Bayes' Theorem written this way is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray&lt;em&gt;}
P(\mbox{model}|\mbox{new evidence}, \mbox{past evidence}) &amp;amp;\sim&amp;amp; P(\mbox{new evidence}|\mbox{model},\mbox{past evidence}) \times \
&amp;amp;&amp;amp; \underbrace{P(\mbox{model}|\mbox{past evidence})}_{\mbox{prior}}
\end{eqnarray&lt;/em&gt;}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've been presented with evidence in the past which makes, under your state of knowledge, certain miracles &lt;em&gt;more likely&lt;/em&gt; then you'll have a &lt;em&gt;higher&lt;/em&gt; prior probability for a miracle interpretation of a new extraordinary claim.  If you've been presented with evidence in the past which makes, under your state of knowledge, miracles &lt;em&gt;less likely&lt;/em&gt; then you'll have a &lt;em&gt;lower&lt;/em&gt; prior probability for a miracle interpretation of a new extraordinary claim.  There is nothing wrong with this situation.  However, where it goes wrong is when people think that having a high prior probability &lt;em&gt;justifies&lt;/em&gt; the belief, or that someone with a low prior is &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; skeptical.  The bottom line is,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If your conclusion is highly sensitive to your prior probability, then your evidence is insufficient to make it reasonable to strongly believe the claim.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is good evidence for a claim then you should be able to convince a skeptic.  Excuses like, your &lt;em&gt;prior&lt;/em&gt; probability (i.e. your "worldview") makes the claim less likely its just that…an excuse for the lack of evidence.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="articles"></category></entry><entry><title>Is Science a Self-Sealing Process?</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2016/Aug/19/is-science-a-self-sealing-process/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-08-19T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2016-08-19T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2016-08-19:/posts/2016/Aug/19/is-science-a-self-sealing-process/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In 1969, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_landing_conspiracy_theories"&gt;NASA faked the moon landing&lt;/a&gt; - there was a huge conspiracy to cover up the facts that the landing was actually filmed in Hollywood.

Well, that's what the conspiracy theories claim.  What about the eye-witness claims of the astronauts themselves?   They must have been in the conspiracy.  What about all of the people supporting the landing effort - scientists, engineers, film crews, etc…?  They must have also been in the conspiracy.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conspiracy theories are examples of &lt;em&gt;self-sealing  ideas&lt;/em&gt; - any criticism can be rolled up into the theory, and either used to support the theory or to make it easy to dodge criticism. In general &lt;em&gt;self-sealing  ideas&lt;/em&gt; obstruct efforts to find the truth because they make it particularly challenging to dislodge the bad idea.   As such, scientists try to make sure that all proposed explanations are &lt;em&gt;falsifiable&lt;/em&gt;, and are thus much less likely to fall prey to this effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="argument-for-the-limits-of-science-from-its-self-sealing-methods"&gt;Argument for the limits of science from its self-sealing methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his debate with Matt Dillahunty on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R4DYhpvNzc"&gt;"Did Jesus Rise From The Dead?"&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/3R4DYhpvNzc?t=2h30m32s"&gt;Blake Giunta's closing statement&lt;/a&gt; has this very clever argument for the supernatural, claiming that the methods of science itself form such a self-sealing process.  He then provides two analogies to drive home the point.  I have never heard anyone else make this argument, and it is challenging to see what the issue actually is, which is why it has been on the back of my mind since the first time I heard it expressed on &lt;a href="http://login.dogmadebate.com/podcast/191-matt-dillahunty-in-studio/"&gt;the Dogma Debate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here is the argument, and the two analogies.  The argument starts with the statement that the basis of science is &lt;em&gt;methodological naturalism&lt;/em&gt; - the deliberate restriction of science to natural causes for natural events.  This is distinct from &lt;em&gt;philosophical naturalism&lt;/em&gt; - the claim that the natural world is all there is.  Philosophical naturalism is typically seen as not scientific, because science can never demonstrate that there is nothing beyond the natural world.  However the processes of science proceed &lt;em&gt;as if&lt;/em&gt; there is nothing beyond the natural world.  So far I have no problem with this.  Matt looked at the evidence put forward about the resurrection, claimed that Blake had not demonstrated supernatural cause, further claimed that there is no known demonstration of the supernatural, and that the "facts" surrounding the resurrection (e.g. apostle's claims to have seen the risen Jesus after he had apparently died, followed by their life reformation) probably have a natural explanations, even if we can't be sure right now what they are.  Matt is perfectly correct here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blake's argument continues here and says that Matt has chosen a self-sealing methodology that rules out, a priori, any supernatural explanations.  Blake's argument is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Science has been very successful in the past in coming up with natural explanations by presupposing naturalism (i.e. methodological naturalism).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are faced with an explanation that may go beyond science (i.e. a supernatural explanation).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We reject the supernatural explanation as a matter of method (i.e. methodological naturalism again).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We claim that eventually we will find a naturalistic explanation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the method is sealed against any possible supernatural explanations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="analogies-to-the-self-sealing-nature-of-science"&gt;Analogies to the self-sealing nature of science&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two analogies Blake introduces are methodological geologism and methodological Biblical inerrantism.  In the former, the investigator is studying formations of rocks and presupposes geological (i.e. non-agent driven) processes - and happens to be looking at Stonehenge at the time.  In the latter, the investigator is studying the claims in the Bible.  Let's see how this plays out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Geology&lt;/strong&gt; has been very successful in the past in coming up with &lt;strong&gt;geological&lt;/strong&gt; explanations by presupposing &lt;strong&gt;geological&lt;/strong&gt; processes (i.e. methodological &lt;strong&gt;geologism&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are faced with an explanation that may go beyond &lt;strong&gt;geology&lt;/strong&gt; (i.e. humans designed Stonehenge).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We reject the "humans designed Stonehenge" explanation as a matter of method (i.e. methodological &lt;strong&gt;geologism&lt;/strong&gt; again).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We claim that eventually we will find a &lt;strong&gt;geological&lt;/strong&gt; explanation for Stonehenge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the other case&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inerrantism&lt;/strong&gt; has been very successful in the past in coming up with &lt;strong&gt;literal&lt;/strong&gt; explanations by presupposing &lt;strong&gt;inerrancy&lt;/strong&gt; in the Bible (i.e. methodological ** inerrantism**).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are faced with an explanation that may go beyond &lt;strong&gt;inerrantism&lt;/strong&gt; (i.e. a supposed contradiction).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We reject the "supposed contradiction" as a matter of method (i.e. methodological ** inerrantism** again).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We claim that eventually we will find a &lt;strong&gt;literal&lt;/strong&gt; explanation for the contradiction (i.e. context, misinterpretation, we don't have the original, etc…).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these cases clearly leads to incorrect conclusions, yet the process seals itself away from the injection of the truth.  Blake claims that the same problem happens with science in general - it seals itself away from the injection of the truth of supernatural claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="where-the-problem-lies"&gt;Where the problem lies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's say that we decide not to declare the Bible inerrant. Where does that get us?  We almost immediately make more sense of the data than would be with the presumption of inerrancy.  These patterns allow us to make predictions, both about new texts we might discover, but also about the types of patterns we might not observe otherwise.  If we assume that, say, the texts were copied from each other we immediately see that Mark was most likely the first Gospel, and suddenly the goals of the authors becomes more clear.  It suddenly makes sense of the &lt;em&gt;types&lt;/em&gt; of discrepancies - how, for example, could there be very detailed word-for-word correspondence on mundane details in stories and yet there can be clear deviations on things as simple to memorize as the Lord's Prayer?  The disconnected two-creation stories of Genesis make sense, especially when compared to books outside the Bible which we wouldn't have considered with "methodological inerrantism".  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about abandoning the geological processes for human-design processes?  There are fields of science around the description of human-designed artifacts, fitting into the overall fields of anthropology and archaeology.  If we abandon a geological description of Stonehenge and assume human design, we can make many predictions which end up being verified - whereas the same sort of predictions assuming geological processes only are either refuted or become ad-hoc when faced with Stonehenge.  We would want our geologists to not waste their time on this sort of thing, and thus expect them to recognize (most of the time) structures that have been influenced by living beings and those influenced by geology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, when we abandon the "methodological inerrantism" and "methodological geologism" we find that we can make specific predictions and realize that the method itself was too restrictive.  We could cling to the method anyway, of course, but that would be a dogmatic ideological position to hold.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="back-to-science"&gt;Back to Science&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens if we try to expand our scientific inquiry to include the supernatural?   Are we being dogmatic and ideological to reject it out of hand?  Methodological naturalism is the resulting method when you attempt to include the supernatural, or supernatural agency, and fail…again….and again.  The reason why scientists apply methodological naturalism is not that they believe that there are no possible supernatural entities, it is just that every attempt to include them has either failed or found after the fact to have diverted the attention away from the correct explanation.  Further, those proposing the supernatural have &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; developed a method for confirming it.  Unlike deviating from Biblical inerrancy, where it is immediately informative,  or deviating from geology, where it is immediately informative, deviating from naturalism has never been informative.  Unlike the other two analogous cases proposed, if we try to include the supernatural we don't end up with predictions, we don't end up with self-consistent explanations, and we don't end up with anything &lt;em&gt;useful&lt;/em&gt;.  Methodological naturalism is the &lt;em&gt;result&lt;/em&gt; of trying to deviate from that method and falling flat.  Methodological naturalism is used not merely for its success (as Blake contends) but also for the failure of the alternatives.  In his analogous cases, the alternatives don't fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="do-we-even-need-to-interject-the-supernatural-here"&gt;Do we even need to interject the supernatural here?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the final problem with the argument Blake presents.  He is &lt;em&gt;forced&lt;/em&gt; to interject the supernatural into his explanation precisely because the evidence is so weak.  Consider what would convince us someone came back from the dead after three days.  Pretty much some simple medical tests (EEG, EKG, etc…) after the person was dead, and perhaps for some time during the three days, and then observations afterward.  We could have compelling evidence (it wouldn't have to convince everyone) for this regardless of the explanation.  The explanation could be all natural - a new cure, new technology, alien intervention, etc…  or we could leave it as an unknown - "hmmmm, that's odd…."  The evidence for the event is different than the cause of the event.  In the case of the resurrection, as with all other claimed miracles, we don't have good evidence that anything actually happened for us to explain, so trying to come up with a cause is premature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we have in Blake's argument, assuming all of his best data is correct, is that some anonymous person reports years after the events that someone else claims he saw a person alive, crucified, and walking around again several days later.  There is no physical evidence at all, there are no medical scans or anything that can distinguish a hundred different possibilities, and we are hearing it second-hand, years afterward, in anonymous texts which show evidence of legendary development.  That wouldn't convince anyone today, and so shouldn't convince anyone about the events 2000 years ago.  The only way to bring it to the point of convincing is to assume the supernatural, an assumption that has never been demonstrated to be reliable.  This is an admission of defeat - the evidence for the event itself is so bad we have to assume an untestable, unreliable process that caused it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science isn't the only show in town because it excludes the contenders as a matter of method. It is the only show in town because the contenders never showed up.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="articles"></category></entry><entry><title>What Makes an Explanation Bad?</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2016/Jul/29/what-makes-an-explanation-bad/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-07-29T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2016-07-29T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2016-07-29:/posts/2016/Jul/29/what-makes-an-explanation-bad/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/david_deutsch_a_new_way_to_explain_explanation"&gt;David Deutsch's TED Talk&lt;/a&gt; he describes what makes good and bad explanations.

In particular he outlines what makes scientific explanations good ones whereas mythological ones bad.  Many people claim that what makes an explanation bad is its lack of testability - goblins are a bad explanation for my car breaking down because you cannot test for goblins.  Although somewhat true, this is not the primary problem with the explanation, according to Deutsch.  The problem is that, even if shown to be false, the goblin explanation is &lt;em&gt;too easy to vary&lt;/em&gt;.  We can tweak it slightly to get the different prediction.  The example in the talk refers to the Greek gods creating the seasons, and that one can easily modify the presumed behavior of those gods to get any result you'd like.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In science, we look for explanations that one can't wiggle out of.  If it is wrong, it must be discarded.  The Higgs boson held a specific and irreplaceable role in the overall theory, and if not observed the theory would have to be seriously rethought and restructured.  Some of the issues with string theory is that it predicts too much, and is too flexible, and thus fails as an explanation.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very similar idea I had &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Feb/15/resurrection-linear-regression-and-the-art-of-harmonization/"&gt;written about before&lt;/a&gt;, with respect to the accounts of the resurrection of Jesus.  An explanation that is too flexible becomes meaningless, and shouldn't be relied on.  It's the same idea that underscores &lt;em&gt;overfitting&lt;/em&gt; in regression and neural network models and the role of Ockam's razor.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="articles"></category></entry><entry><title>Student Course Evaluations</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2016/Jan/15/student-course-evaluations/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-01-15T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2016-01-15T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2016-01-15:/posts/2016/Jan/15/student-course-evaluations/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’m always interested in the process of evaluation, especially for professors.

It is common to have student evaluations performed at the end of the semester, and there are endless debates about their value.  I try to take the evaluations seriously, usually trying to glean some general places where I can improve things.  I figured I’d try something a bit different here.  I’m posting the full response to the question “What are your comments regarding the instructor of the course?” from one of my 200-level Weather and Natural Disasters sections.  It is a course which satisfies a general education requirement at the foundational level, and typically focusses on the analysis of weather, climate, and disaster data.  It introduces and reinforces notions of plotting data, regression, interpretation of data, reading contour maps, etc…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s an interesting and somewhat entertaining read.  I don’t take the negative evaluations personally, always trying to see the kernel of truth or where the student might be coming from.  My question here is, what should I do with responses like this?  You may notice a few conflicting viewpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Though tough and giving a lot of work, Brian Blais is always ready to help students who will ask questions. He explains the material really well, and takes his time to answer many questions in class. I sometimes had a hard time linking the different chapters we did though. But he used different ways of making us understand the class by analyzing different documentaries for example, and tried to vary the form our assignments should take which is pretty interesting. I would recommend this professor to others because he is very helpful, but would warn them that he gives a lot of work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If everyone in the class gets an answer wrong take it off the test. It may be a "good" question but if everyone gets it wrong then it is to good of a question. Also if everyone gets the same question wrong, maybe you should go over it more in class, so that the students actually understand the question. I spent hours on each homework assignment and it was a struggle to complete them correctly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frustrating at times, however always available for extra help, you have to work hard to get a good grade.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;professor blais is smart and engaging and i really enjoy taking his class. i would recommend him to anyone, also his passion for the subject is clearly shown through his enthusiasm in class.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good guy, knows everything basically off the top of his head. Could be a bit more clear with his assignments but overall, good professor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes assumes students know more than they do. Tough to keep up. Homework is painfully difficult which he thinks is good but I just give up on them because I don't understand how to do them. Challenge is good, but sometimes too much is counterproductive to learning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It took a little while getting use to how Blais operated. A couple of times in the beginning of the semester I was taken aback at some of his statements, but it's always a truthful and very straightforward statement; something I was not used to coming from college professors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the instructor does a great job applying this class to real life situation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;decided to not even even use blackboard and put everything on google drive, made it much harder because it was so different then my other classes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For a 200 level course that most if not all students are taking as an elective, it is extremely difficult and the material is not taught in a simple way. The lectures are all over the place sometimes and they are hard to follow. It would be more beneficial to students if you just slowed down and answered our questions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Truly awful, Answers questions with thats a good question.. why are you there if you wont answer the question. There is no need to make an science elective this hard and full of unnecessary work at a business school, we have other stuff we have to put our attention on that we actually want to learn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The instructor is a very nice person. In class I enjoyed having him as a professor. However, I believe because he is so intelligent he will explain topics rapidly with the expectation that the class understands. As a result the class is so confused that they refrain from asking questions. Further more the instructors lectures were very little help when doing home work leading to the great frustrations and long hours trying to understand the homework and figuring out solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Professor is a helpful and was a great resource to myself throughout the semester when questions arose. He can be really sarcastic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please give more clear answers to student's questions, rather than saying "I don't know" to certain questions. If you don't know can you at least try to find out, that's kind of your job......&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I thought the instructor was very tough at first but if you put in the effort his teaching style is very smooth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Professor Blais seems like a pretty laid back person. However, he can sometimes be rude without realizing it, and his "bus policy" is the worst rule I have ever seen by a professor. Some students have appointments with advisors, etc. before his class. He should be understanding of those walking in late. Locking the door is pretty excessive, no? Assignments are too long, but his teaching ability is adequate and he clearly loves his job. I can't say I would recommend him to a friend, though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The instructor of this course is very helpful outside of the classroom, however, during class time he does not provide clear instructions for homework assignments and fails to answer students' questions clearly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obviously the professor is very smart and really knows about what he is teaching, but how he teaches is very confusing and scattered. We sort of jump around from subject to subject so I get confused about what is related to what. The professor also doesn't answer questions clearly and ends up leaving many of us more confused than before. He does not communicate clearly what is expected for assignments so it leaves us guessing and hoping we did it right. He has a good amount of office hours available for extra help but only in the morning which is when many students are in classes so it can be difficult to meet with him outside of class.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Professor Blais is often vague or flippant in answering genuine questions asked by the class and greatly underestimates how long his assignments actually take.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Professor Blais is a really nice guy, considerate to students, loves what he is teaching. I think he needs to better explain the material though because we are most likely hearing all of this for the first time and might not be able to grasp the concepts and connections right away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The professor is very knowledgeable. The topics seem difficult at first, but after a few days the material becomes easier. Believes his class is the only class a student is enrolled in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have actually recommended this class to many of my friends and also the teacher.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unclear or misleading at times, but very enthusiastic about the subject.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assignments need to be improved because the course material did not connect enough between lectures and homework. Also needs to be much more organized. The grading system, well there sometimes isn't a grading system. He just distributes grades based off of aesthetic quality and relative .connection to the student&lt;/li&gt;

I have dealt with Blake’s discussions &lt;a href="the-giunta-dillahunty-debate.html"&gt;here before&lt;/a&gt;, but this time it really jumped out at me what the problem was.  The topic was divine hiddenness, and Blake specifically wanted to address that part of the divine hiddenness problem where God seems to be invisible in every way to non-believers - why does he hide?  You can listen to the debate, jump to 44:40 where he outlines many possibilities for why God might not want to or feel the need to appear to unbelievers.  They include things like “the human might lack the right desire for God” (e.g. to escape punishment) or “some non-theists might form an initial proper relationship with God [if he was revealed to them] but then abandon it later on”.  There is another list of responses from other philosophers Blake gives later in the show, but a more complete exploration can be found at &lt;a href="https://beliefmap.org/god-exists/divine-hiddenness/"&gt;Blake’s website here&lt;/a&gt;.  In each of these cases, the argument goes, God would have good reason not to make himself known. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The response given here is essentially the same response apologists give for the problem of suffering - God may have good reasons you don’t know about.  Fair enough, but that doesn’t give us any reason to actually believe in this being.  I think it is probably true that, give the conception of God that Blake gives, there is sufficient flexibility that &lt;em&gt;any and all&lt;/em&gt; philosophical arguments will fail - one cannot assign either a probability 1 or 0 to the existence of this God.  For me, I don’t really care.  I want a reason to actually believe that something exists;  if someone is making the claim, I want evidence.  This sort of argument might be a first step - maybe God is silent because “some non-theists might form an initial proper relationship with God [if he was revealed to them] but then abandon it later on”.  Ok, but how could you test that?  It may be &lt;em&gt;plausible&lt;/em&gt; yet still false, as are most of the reasonable ideas people come up with.  In science, we don’t finish with the argument, we start with it and ask “how would we know?”  I’ve never heard Blake, or any other apologist, take that next crucial step.  How can you, through some kind of observation, tell the difference between one of these excuses being true and God simply not existing?  How can you, through some kind of &lt;em&gt;observation&lt;/em&gt;, tell the difference between the different reasons purported to explain this hiddenness - given that it is impossible they are all true in all cases.&lt;/p&gt;

You can read one response in the &lt;a href="http://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/12/29/opinion/verbatim-expert-witness.html"&gt;opinion piece in the NY Times&lt;/a&gt;.  The summary is that the “expert” was supposedly  unable to perform the following calculation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who may be curious about the specific math, let me lay out the numbers. The diagram had a distance the witness measured as 3 and three-sixteenths inches with a scale of 20 feet per inch. The witness said this came to approximately 68 feet. In fact it is 63.75 feet. If the expert witness had taken a few seconds to use his calculator, he could have (hopefully) come to the same conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watched the video, and can confirm that the expert should have done better, but I am not entirely convinced that this is incompetence.  I could imagine someone being nervous about lawyers, feeling that the questions were going to be “gotcha” questions - or at least lead to that - and that you’d want a away to double-check any calculation.  Although looking bad, imagine if he had tried this calculation and (through nervousness) came to an incorrect number.  How bad would that look?  Certainly that would have looked worse.  What if he came to the correct number, but noticed the discrepancy - he’d still want to double-check the numbers through the methods he typically uses.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, once he had decided that the line of questioning was just trying to “get him”, whether he was competent or not, there was no way that he was going to budge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think his incompetence may lay in the fact that he didn’t bring the materials he needed to assess the situation quantitatively.  That seems ridiculous.  What sorts of lessons can we draw from this video?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always bring your materials that you need, if you’re going to be questioned about the details of a result you’ve claimed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be prepared to address the claims on several levels of detail - from the fully quantitative level worthy of a technical report, to a back-of-the-envelope calculation which gets close to it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Listen to the question that someone is actually asking, not the question you think they are asking.  &lt;/li&gt;

The point is that arguments are not evidence. He says that in all of the debates that he seen between atheists and theists he's never seen anyone bring up this idea which really should show that the theist has lost the debate from the beginning.  I &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2015/Jul/28/evidence-vs-argument/"&gt;mentioned it here&lt;/a&gt; when I was looking at Blake Giunta debate with Matt Dillahunty.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some things that you can learn from proofs - such as mathematical proofs. For example you may find a relationship between two things that was unintuitive at first. However I think in the case of the &lt;em&gt;existence&lt;/em&gt; of an actual thing then you can gain no knowledge from philosophy or argumentation or proof. You really need something that's demonstrable, that's repeatable, something that gets around the biases and failings of the human thought process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree wholeheartedly with Mr Deity in stating that science is simply the process people use to bypass the failings of human biases.  I also agree with the idea that the argument is the &lt;em&gt;start&lt;/em&gt;, not the end, of the discussion - the argument serves as a hypothesis.&lt;sup id="fnref:grammar"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:grammar"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;  Given that there are a million different intuitive, simple, logically consistent, wrong hypotheses out there the effort must be made by anyone making a claim to find alternate ways of confirming the claims.&lt;br&gt;
. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:grammar"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never know whether to use “an” or “a” with hypothesis, either in written form or spoken.  It sounds weird to me either way.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:grammar" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It’s a time for reflection, contemplation, self improvement.  I realize that it is technically just another day, and that one could definitely have any day in the year serve this role, but there still feels like something special for this day.  I try to have some modest New Years resolutions.  Ones I have failed in the past are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lose weight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do a triathlon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ones that I have succeeded in the past are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lose weight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read the entire Bible, cover to cover&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run a 5k&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run a half marathon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read 6 books cover to cover (I have a bad habit of starting books and not finishing them)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, I want to focus on writing.  My hope is to be able to write 300 words a day - that’s only a page of text.  But if I can do it every day, that’s a book!  Mostly, I want to get the habit.  In the spirit of new things, I’m trying &lt;a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php"&gt;Scrivener&lt;/a&gt; as a new editing tool.  I’m not sure if it will work for me, but I do hope to get more blog writing and book writing this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This past semester got totally crazy, as I am to the chair of the department and thus have a lot of new responsibilities.  I am slowly getting used to it, but the end of the semester took all my writing time away.  Now, with a commitment to it, I do think that I can make progress on a number of projects that have been languishing somewhat - including this blog. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the plus side, this year I read &lt;em&gt;The Martian&lt;/em&gt;, and saw the movie, both of which were fantastic.  Definitely a good science movie and book, highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="articles"></category></entry><entry><title>End of a long semester</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2015/Dec/21/end-of-a-long-semester/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-12-21T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2015-12-21T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2015-12-21:/posts/2015/Dec/21/end-of-a-long-semester/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, I've been off the blog because of new job duties that overwhelmed me for a while.

I enjoy the new year as a way of starting again, clean slate, and to try to be better at what I like to do.  I'd like to write a lot more in the coming year so I'm trying something new. I'll post here if it works out (or not) somewhat later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things on my to-do list for the winter "break":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write a paper on the use of Wikipedia in the classroom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finish and submit a paper on the dynamics of Twitter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write some more about probability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write a paper on the analysis of Michael Crichton's &lt;em&gt;State of Fear&lt;/em&gt; for the classroom&lt;/li&gt;

Let me start positive, however.  I really love &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos:_A_Spacetime_Odyssey"&gt;Cosmos&lt;/a&gt;, and feel that Tyson is well cast as the narrator (although I will always be partial to Carl Sagan).  I find, however, that Neil deGrasse Tyson commonly makes glib statements that sound smart at first but then when you think about them they aren't as profound.  One such example is his list of 9 things that he doesn't understand about the movie Interstellar (serious spoilers below).  Most, if not all, of them have ready answers but are presented in a glib manner.  Here is the list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you can poke through a tesseract and touch books, why not just write a note and pass it through.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stars vastly outnumber Black Holes. Why is the best Earthlike planet one that orbits a Black Hole&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who in the universe would ever know the titles of all their books, from behind, on an bookshelf.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How a pickup truck can drive with a flat tire among densely planted corn stalks taller than it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If wormholes exist among our planets, then why can't one open up near Earth instead of Saturn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gotta tell you. Mars (right next door) looks waay safer than those new planets they travelled to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you crack your space helmet yet keep fighting, the Planet's air can't be all that bad for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can't imagine a future where escaping Earth via wormhole is a better plan than just fixing Earth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In this unreal future, they teach unscientific things in science class. Oh, wait. That is real.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take (1), for example.  If you watch the scene you'll notice that a) Cooper doesn't &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; any paper in the scene and b) he's in a space suit - a little challenging to write on paper, even if he had it.  Seriously?  Then there is (3), which is factually incorrect - he doesn't know the titles, he's punches out Morse code (backwards, of course) so that the book and spaces show the dots and dashes.  Even if he needed the titles, there is a famous scene described in Gleick's book &lt;em&gt;Genius&lt;/em&gt; where Richard Feynman and Julian Schwinger at a party both rattle off from memory the encyclopedia titles of their child-hood encyclopedia set, so that isn't completely ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On points (2), (5) and (6) - the humans had no choice in the placement of the wormhole - there could very well be a good reason for its placement - or the placement of the types of planets.   In fact, if you understand the narrative, the future humans need to lead Cooper over to a black hole in order to communicate the info to the daughter.  In (6), it's clear that the astronauts think these planets might be more habitable than Mars - it's only after they get there that they realize that doesn't work.  In (7) is it not possible to partially crack a helmet and still remain air-tight?  Is (8) even serious?  Can you not imagine messing up an environent to the point where it is better to leave than to stay behind?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we're left with (4), the problem of driving a truck fast with a flat tire.  Not exactly a terrible science problem, as I see it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue I have is that these are communicated (usally over twitter) as if they are clever, slam-dunk, obvious issues when a cursory glance at them shows otherwise.  This is an &lt;em&gt;educational&lt;/em&gt; criticism, and I expect better of science educators.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="articles"></category></entry><entry><title>Answering Unanswerable Questions</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2015/Sep/11/answering-unanswerable-questions/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-09-11T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2015-09-11T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2015-09-11:/posts/2015/Sep/11/answering-unanswerable-questions/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of questions designed specifically to not have answers or statements designed to be imponderable. Some of them actually do have answers, it seems, when you peel away what the question or statement actually says versus what is implied.  Over the years, I've found alternate ways of looking at three of these - one came to me this week - so I thought I'd share these pearls of wisdom.  Sometimes all it takes is to reframe the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="example-1-which-came-first-the-chicken-or-the-egg"&gt;Example 1: Which came first, the chicken or the egg?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an age-old question, designed to be imponderable - if the chicken is first, then didn't it hatch out of an egg?  If the egg came first, what animal laid that egg?  The answer to the question can be seen by reframing the question with a slight rewording:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which came first, the chicken or the &lt;em&gt;chicken&lt;/em&gt; egg?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That question might be imponderable, when the original one is not.  Dinosaurs, as one example, laid eggs and predated chickens by millions of years.  Thus, the egg came first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="example-2-that-is-six-of-one-half-a-dozen-of-another"&gt;Example 2: That is six of one, half-a-dozen of another.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This statement is clearly designed to mean something that doesn't make any difference - both alternatives are the same.  However, a little reframing shows that they are not the same.  Imagine I get my six or half dozen through a process of ordering food, especially at a bakery.  In that context I might get 13 (a baker's dozen) and thus a "half-a-dozen" might yield 6.5 rather than just 6.  It doesn't have to happen all the time for there still to be a difference - there is a small probability that half-a-dozen is a bit more than six.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="example-3-when-i-was-a-kid-i-walked-to-school-in-the-snow-up-hill-both-ways"&gt;Example 3: When I was a kid, I walked to school in the snow, up hill both ways.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My final example is a common phrase uttered by parents to humorously exaggerate the efforts they had to make as kids.  The imponderable, of course, is how can you walk to a place and back going up hill both ways.  We can see that this is indeed a possibility, if we reframe the statement a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I walked to school in the snow, up hill &lt;em&gt;the entire way&lt;/em&gt; both ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we can obviously see that the way to be able to go up hill both ways is if the trip involves a downhill and an uphill - you will be going up hill both ways, at &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, you may find some of these a little stretched, and making much ado about nothing, but I think the lesson here is larger.  Sometimes people try to frame a problem with an "obvious" interpretation to get you to think in a certain way.  However, with an eye for the difference between stated and implied, we can come to reasonable alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="articles"></category></entry><entry><title>Evidence vs Argument</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2015/Jul/28/evidence-vs-argument/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-07-28T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2015-07-28T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2015-07-28:/posts/2015/Jul/28/evidence-vs-argument/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was listening to the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_p5eQE-iM"&gt;Giunta-Dillahunty debate&lt;/a&gt;, "Does God Exist?", and the subsequent appearance of these two &lt;a href="http://www.spreaker.com/user/smalleyandhyso/191-matt-dillahunty-in-studio?utm_source=widget&amp;amp;utm_medium=widget"&gt;on the Dogma Debate show&lt;/a&gt;, and was struck by the structure of the …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was listening to the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_p5eQE-iM"&gt;Giunta-Dillahunty debate&lt;/a&gt;, "Does God Exist?", and the subsequent appearance of these two &lt;a href="http://www.spreaker.com/user/smalleyandhyso/191-matt-dillahunty-in-studio?utm_source=widget&amp;amp;utm_medium=widget"&gt;on the Dogma Debate show&lt;/a&gt;, and was struck by the structure of the argument. Blake Giunta seems to be confident that &lt;em&gt;philosophical&lt;/em&gt; arguments can be used as evidence for the existence of God when scientific procedures fail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although much of the discussion involves what counts as evidence, the notion of probability and knowledge, and the role of the supernatural in inference, there is a more basic question that is never brought up.  I would love to hear even one case of the existence of an entity that was ever best described only in &lt;em&gt;philosophical&lt;/em&gt; terms, or an entity whose existence we could at some point be confident in through &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; a philosophical argument.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that if you are asked for your best evidence for the existence of something, and you present only a &lt;em&gt;philosophical&lt;/em&gt; argument, then you are &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Jan/21/philosophy-and-science-whats-the-difference/"&gt;conceding that you have no data&lt;/a&gt;.  If someone asked for the best evidence for Neptune, you'd show the &lt;a href="http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/imagesvideo/neptune.html"&gt;Voyager pictures&lt;/a&gt; and the pictures from telescopes.  If it were 100 years ago, you'd show telescopic traces in the sky.  If it were 200 years ago, one might be able to give a &lt;em&gt;philosophical&lt;/em&gt; argument about the simplicity of 8 planets instead of 6, or the &lt;em&gt;possibility&lt;/em&gt; of large gas giants other than Jupiter and Saturn, but one would never be justified in a strong belief in such an entity with such arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blake Giunta also commented that "before you can give evidence for what God did in the world you first have to demonstrate possibility [of his existence]."  He does this with the philosophical arguments, but again this is misguided.  If someone asks for your evidence for the existence of something, and you give a &lt;em&gt;philosophical&lt;/em&gt; argument for its possibility you are conceding defeat.  Why not present the evidence of the existence?  That itself will answer the possibility question - if I present pictures of Neptune from the Voyager mission, the question of the possibility of Neptune's existence becomes moot.   &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="articles"></category></entry><entry><title>It's not the New Atheists that are Arrogant</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2015/May/12/its-not-the-new-atheists-that-are-arrogant/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-05-12T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2015-05-12T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2015-05-12:/posts/2015/May/12/its-not-the-new-atheists-that-are-arrogant/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/2015/05/09/new_atheisms_fatal_arrogance_the_glaring_intellectual_laziness_of_bill_maher_richard_dawkins/"&gt;Salon article&lt;/a&gt; entitled "&lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/2015/05/09/new_atheisms_fatal_arrogance_the_glaring_intellectual_laziness_of_bill_maher_richard_dawkins/"&gt;New Atheism’s fatal arrogance: The glaring intellectual laziness of Bill Maher &amp;amp; Richard Dawkins&lt;/a&gt;", Sean Illing outlines what he seems to think are knock-down arguments …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/2015/05/09/new_atheisms_fatal_arrogance_the_glaring_intellectual_laziness_of_bill_maher_richard_dawkins/"&gt;Salon article&lt;/a&gt; entitled "&lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/2015/05/09/new_atheisms_fatal_arrogance_the_glaring_intellectual_laziness_of_bill_maher_richard_dawkins/"&gt;New Atheism’s fatal arrogance: The glaring intellectual laziness of Bill Maher &amp;amp; Richard Dawkins&lt;/a&gt;", Sean Illing outlines what he seems to think are knock-down arguments about the content and approach of those so-called "New Atheists" such as Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris.  The core of the article is in the third paragraph:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there’s something missing in their critiques, something fundamental. For all their eloquence, their arguments are often banal. Regrettably, they’ve shown little interest in understanding the religious compulsion. They talk incessantly about the untruth of religion because they assume truth is what matters most to religious people. And perhaps it does for many, but certainly not all – at least not in the conventional sense of that term. Religious convictions, in many cases, are held not because they’re true but because they’re meaningful, because they’re personally transformative. New Atheists are blind to this brand of belief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another gem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, most religious people consider their beliefs true in some sense, but that’s to be expected: the consolation derived from a belief is greater if its illusory origins are concealed. The point is that such beliefs aren’t held because they’re true as such; they’re accepted on faith because they’re meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just ask yourself, if you swapped out "religion" in the texts above, and inserted astrology, witchcraft, alien visitation, scientology, 911 Truther or Anti-vaccination, would the author still have such a glib response to the lack of evidence?  These all give their adherents meaning, a feeling of belonging to something greater than themselves, or an importance to themselves that they wouldn't otherwise have.  Who are we to criticize these?  They "consider their beliefs true in some sense" but gain some "consolation derived from the belief", and thus these "beliefs aren’t held because they’re true as such; they’re accepted on faith because they’re meaningful".  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially Sean Illing is saying that it doesn't matter whether the belief is true, it only matters if it makes you feel good.  Of course he excludes himself from these false notions with "many people (myself included) find no practical advantage in believing things without evidence. But what about those who do?"  What a patronizing and arrogant thing to say!  Seems like he's projecting a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does Sean Illing not see the dangers in this line of reasoning?  It &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; matter if people believe things without evidence.  It &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; matter that, even in the cases where the belief is "content free", that the believers are using the same vocabulary as the fanatics - and thus provide intellectual cover for the fanatics.  It &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; matter that believing in something merely because it gives you meaning, or makes you feel good, is a bad idea.  How much legitimate meaning could be derived from beliefs that are not well supported by evidence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the message of the so-called New Atheists, and it is not arrogant. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="articles"></category></entry><entry><title>Priors vs Likelihoods</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2015/May/05/priors-vs-likelihoods/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-05-05T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2015-05-05T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2015-05-05:/posts/2015/May/05/priors-vs-likelihoods/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was reading the article &lt;a href="https://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2015/04/16/why-i-am-not-a-bayesian/"&gt;Why I am not a Bayesian&lt;/a&gt; where Greg Mayer complains about the Bayesian approach to inference, and espouses Maximum Likelihood methods.

There is much to critique in the article, but let's consider one question he raises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three ways round the problem of prior distributions. First, try really hard to find an objective way of portraying ignorance. This hasn’t worked yet, but some people are still trying. Second, note that the prior probabilities make little difference to the posterior probabilty as more and more data accumulate (i.e. as more experiments/observations provide more likelihoods), viz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P(posterior) ∝ P(prior) × Likelihood  × Likelihood × Likelihood × . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, only the likelihoods make a difference; but this is less a defense of Bayesianism than a surrender to likelihood. Third, boldly embrace subjectivity. But then, since everyone has their own prior, the only thing we can agree upon are the likelihoods.  So, why not just use the likelihoods?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with Bayesianism is that it asks the wrong question. It asks, ‘How should I modify my current beliefs in the light of the data?’, rather than ‘Which hypotheses are best supported by the data?’. Bayesianism tells me (and me alone) what to believe, while likelihood tells us (all of us) what the data say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I follow his question of "why not just use the likelihoods" with the following question:  Given that &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_the_Octopus"&gt;Paul the Octopus&lt;/a&gt; predicted 12 out of 14 World Cup matches, does Greg Mayer accept that the octopus is psychic?  Why or why not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My guess is "no", but why?  The &lt;em&gt;likelihood&lt;/em&gt; (i.e. how well the hypothesis supports the data) is exceptionally high. Higher, I'd say, than nearly any other hypothesis.  Actually, now that I think about it, the hypothesis "aliens that like the number 12 and influence octopi made it happen" is a better one.  These are clearly ridiculous because they are &lt;em&gt;implausible&lt;/em&gt; to start, and thus have a lower &lt;em&gt;prior probability&lt;/em&gt;.  In fact Bayesianism is asking the only interesting question, and it provides the framework to actually compare hypotheses, something that frequentist methods fail spectacularly at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greg Mayer is a Bayesian, he just fails to admit it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="articles"></category></entry><entry><title>Superseding the $t$ test</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2015/Apr/23/superseding-the-t-test/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-04-23T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2015-04-23T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2015-04-23:/posts/2015/Apr/23/superseding-the-t-test/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;There's a very nice paper, &lt;a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~kruschke/articles/Kruschke2013JEPG.pdf"&gt;Bayesian estimation supersedes the t test&lt;/a&gt;.

The methods described provide at once posterior probabilities not just for the means of two groups, but their standard deviations, their normality, and effect size.  The &lt;a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~kruschke/BEST/"&gt;supporting website&lt;/a&gt; has a lot of useful resources, including a number of implementations.  The original implementation is in R, but there is a &lt;a href="https://github.com/strawlab/best"&gt;Python implementation using PyMC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to implement the same thing using the &lt;a href="http://dan.iel.fm/emcee/current/"&gt;emcee package&lt;/a&gt;.  The full implementation is &lt;a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/bblais/7a1c6ec3b4c8d1b0465f"&gt;viewable here&lt;/a&gt;.  My implementation is pretty general, and can handle some arbitrary tests of the variables, like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;table class="highlighttable"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="linenos"&gt;&lt;div class="linenodiv"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="normal"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="normal"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class="code"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;P&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;(mu1&amp;gt;101) &amp;amp; (mu1&amp;lt;102.1)&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.85502222222222224&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;table class="highlighttable"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="linenos"&gt;&lt;div class="linenodiv"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="normal"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;

T. Jaynes wrote extensively about Bayesian inference, and one of his strategies was to use a "Galileo's telescope for statistics", such as outlined in his paper on &lt;a href="http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/confidence.pdf"&gt;Confidence Intervals vs Bayesian Intervals&lt;/a&gt;.  This method is used to distinguish between two alternate approaches to a problem.  The strategy entails finding particularly simple cases where the two cases yield very different answers, and the correct one is obvious from the context and the simplicity of the problem.  In this way, the difference is magnified like a telescope so that it is clear to the unaided observation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are, I've found, similar sorts of cases in apologetics.  There are a few questions I've heard that are so simple, yet get to the heart of the matter.  I've collected them here, and always enjoy finding others.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="is-there-free-will-in-heaven"&gt;Is there free will in Heaven?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is, then the free-will argument for the the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_evil"&gt;Problem of Evil&lt;/a&gt; falls apart.  If there is not, then heaven is filled with automatons and the soul is meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="how-did-paul-know-it-was-jesus-that-he-saw"&gt;How did Paul know it was Jesus that he saw?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Paul wasn't an eyewitness to Jesus, how did he know that he was being visited by Jesus in a vision?  How does he know that he saw the same person that others saw?  Thus, even at best, how do we know as readers that his testimony is reliable at all, as the apologists claim?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="how-did-you-determine-in-the-bible-that-god-is-the-good-guy-and-satan-is-the-bad-guy"&gt;How did you determine in the Bible that God is the good guy and Satan is the bad guy?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one points to the real source of morality - ourselves.  We use our own moral intuitions to decide which parts of the Bible are worth keeping and which to ignore.  Even if you look at the beginning of Genesis, the snake is the one that is correct about the Tree of Knowledge when God is not.  Using the argument that God's book says that God is good is, obviously, fallacious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="why-does-paul-never-use-the-word-disciple-and-only-uses-the-word-apostle"&gt;Why does Paul &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; use the word disciple and only uses the word apostle?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one isn't quite as strong, but it was the one that got me thinking about the evidence (or lack of evidence) for the existence of Jesus.  This simple question highlights the fact that Paul never mentions anything about the life of Jesus at all.  He doesn't seem to be aware that Peter and James, for example, were supposedly disciples of of Jesus - following an actual person - not just apostles - spreading the word about Jesus.  He never mentions Nazareth, or anything at all that Jesus said - not a single quote from Jesus is found in any of Paul's writing, and he is the earliest and most prolific New Testament writer.  I find that really interesting.  For me, it makes me agnostic about Jesus existing at all as a historical figure.  I've never seen a compelling case either way.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are there any more such questions?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="articles"></category></entry><entry><title>Misquoting Hume</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2015/Feb/21/misquoting-hume/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-02-21T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2015-02-21T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2015-02-21:/posts/2015/Feb/21/misquoting-hume/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recall a comment in E.

T. Jaynes' book about Laplace, where he realized that most of the arguments against the claims of Laplace were arguments against things Laplace never said.  Jaynes would habitually check the original source whenever he heard claims ascribed to Laplace, and found that Laplace was consistently misquoted.  Recently, I have realized that the same can be said of Hume.   I've &lt;a href="{filename}Unbelievable Project/sun_rise_tomorrow.md"&gt;written before&lt;/a&gt; about the claim that Hume believed we have "no good reason at all for thinking the sun will rise tomorrow" (spoiler alert: he didn't believe this). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I've seen this little pithy Hume quote: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The evidence for the regular is always greater than that for the rare."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in &lt;a href="http://www.bethinking.org/are-miracles-possible/the-question-of-miracles-the-contemporary-influence-of-hume"&gt;various&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.roomfordoubt.com/examine/2/Questions-of-Faith/11/Don-t-miracles-violate-the-laws-of-nature-Isn-t-that-just-unbelievable"&gt;critiques&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.mbu.edu/seminary/journal/a-critique-of-david-humes-on-miracles/"&gt;of Hume&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=FPmV30uX1_4C&amp;amp;pg=PA207&amp;amp;lpg=PA207&amp;amp;dq=%22The+evidence+for+the+regular+is+always+greater+than+that+for+the+rare%22&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=d9it4bTi3N&amp;amp;sig=5D-zAM9UJ0CkkM17J0ovbCWR9XY&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=w6HoVN6PHpbbsATFgIGADg&amp;amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=%22The%20evidence%20for%20the%20regular%20is%20always%20greater%20than%20that%20for%20the%20rare%22&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;on the web&lt;/a&gt;.  The problem?  Hume never says this.  You can read Hume's &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; statements about miracles in the two parts of his argument here: &lt;a href="http://www.bartleby.com/37/3/14.html"&gt;part 1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.bartleby.com/37/3/15.html"&gt;part 2&lt;/a&gt;.  The misquotes that I have seen are always from Christian apologists, so it isn't totally surprising.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think one of the reasons this occurs is that Hume predates probability theory, so he uses verbose explanations where the modern reader can insert a single statement.  For example, reading Hume's work on Miracles, it is clear to me that what he intends to say is simply&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the &lt;em&gt;prior probability&lt;/em&gt; for the regular is always greater than the rare &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a bit less pithy, but more correct (although Hume doesn't phrase it quite like that either).  This is at least a factual statement - before the data, we should believe the regular over the rare.  That doesn't imply that data couldn't &lt;em&gt;convince&lt;/em&gt; us of rare events, it only implies that it is more &lt;em&gt;difficult&lt;/em&gt; for data to convince us of rare vs regular events (i.e. you need better evidence for the rare).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an &lt;a href="http://ez.premierchristianradio.com/radio/Shows/Saturday/Unbelievable/Episodes/Unbelievable-9-Aug-2008-Norman-Geisler-American-Masters-of-Apologetics-pt-4"&gt;Unbelievable podcast interview with apologist Norman Geisler&lt;/a&gt;, Geisler uses the first "quote" of Hume above, and then argues that Hume must be wrong because science already accepts singular and rare events - the Big Bang, the origin of life, and macro evolution (this last one is, of course, neither singular nor rare).  Geisler then concludes that miracles can exist!  However, seen in the light of probability theory, it becomes clear.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prior probability of the events is low:
\begin{eqnarray}
P(\mbox{Big Bang})\ll 1 \\
P(\mbox{Origin of Life})\ll 1 \\
P(\mbox{Macro Evolution})\ll 1 \\
P(\mbox{Miracles})\ll 1
\end{eqnarray}
but with data, we have something quite different:
\begin{eqnarray}
P(\mbox{Big Bang}|{\rm data})\sim 1 \\
P(\mbox{Origin of Life}|{\rm data})\sim 1 \\
P(\mbox{Macro Evolution}|{\rm data})\sim 1 \\
P(\mbox{Miracles}|{\rm data})\sim  0
\end{eqnarray}
where the data are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Big Bang - &lt;a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/astronomy/bigbang.html"&gt;a long list&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Origin of Life - a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis"&gt;nice summary&lt;/a&gt; with RNA world, and autocatalysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Macro Evolution - a term not used by biologists, but &lt;a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/"&gt;another long list&lt;/a&gt; for evolution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Miracles - nothing convincing to the scientific community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, although all these things &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; occur, only a few of them &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; have evidence strong enough to overcome their initial low prior probability.  Hume recognized this for miracles, as was clear from his writings, although it would have been clearer had he had the benefit of probabilistic vocabulary.  Don't take my word for it, go read Hume &lt;a href="http://www.bartleby.com/37/3/14.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.bartleby.com/37/3/15.html"&gt;and here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="articles"></category></entry><entry><title>Testing the Supernatural</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2015/Feb/04/testing-the-supernatural/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-02-04T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2015-02-04T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2015-02-04:/posts/2015/Feb/04/testing-the-supernatural/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In an interesting paper entitled "&lt;a href="http://www.naturalism.org/Can%20Science%20Test%20Supernatural%20Worldviews-%20Final%20Author%27s%20Copy%20%28Fishman%202007%29.pdf"&gt;Can Science Test Supernatural Worldviews&lt;/a&gt;", Yonatan Fishman proposes an unusual answer of "yes".

I've spoken to this issue &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2011/Dec/20/closed-to-the-supernatural/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Sep/04/the-supernatural-and-the-history-of-cosmology/"&gt;again here&lt;/a&gt;, where I refer to the term "supernatural" as a label-of-the-gaps, and trace its usage in ancient cosmology.  I've stated that the term itself is either content-free or not defined specifically enough to be useful.  However, I do make the following statement which I think points to Fishman's perspective:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd love to see something that really rises to the level of a miracle, like the 10 commandments etched in Pluto or something. Although technically a God-of-the-Gaps argument, it would be very interesting indeed! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can ask the question, what would convince you of the existence of the supernatural, or of God?  Fishman points out that if prayer actually worked, and only Catholic prayers were effective, that would in fact be evidence for the supernatural.  What I find interesting about this line of thinking is that, even if you expect that there should be a natural explanation, if the person claiming supernatural agency continues to make specific predictions that turn out true - predictions that, at least on the face, seem to be unexpected from our current understanding - then you'd have to start thinking that they are on to something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I think is going on here is something a bit different than a God-of-the-gaps, at least in some contexts.  One way of thinking about it is with an analogy to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter"&gt;Dark Matter&lt;/a&gt;.  In astronomy it was observed that galaxies rotated more rapidly than expected.  Using the light emitted from the galaxy, you can estimate the amount of material needed to emit that light, and use that to determine rotation speeds.  The amount of mass estimated from the light emitted is far less than the amount of mass estimated from the rotation speeds - somehow there is a large amount of mass unaccounted for.  Astronomers named this extra mass "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter"&gt;Dark Matter&lt;/a&gt;".  Notice, that this is not an &lt;em&gt;explanation&lt;/em&gt; for the extra mass, but a &lt;em&gt;label&lt;/em&gt; for "something I don't know is causing this effect".  One then has to make propositions of specific causes, like neutrinos, black holes, or even modifications of the laws of physics.  From there one makes specific predictions, constructs methods for testing the propositions, and explores alternatives.  The term, "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter"&gt;Dark Matter&lt;/a&gt;", is still used as the umbrella term to label all of these alternatives.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this way, the term "supernatural" may be a label for "something I don't know is causing this effect", where the effect may be a miracle claim, prayers answered, origin of the universe, origin of life, etc...  Thus, the phrase "supernatural explanation" is a meaningless phrase - there can be no supernatural explanation, just as Dark Matter is not an explanation.  However, as Fishman uses in his title, one could test "supernatural worldviews" - those constructions that use the label to suggest some unknown (and possibly unknowable) agency at work.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One might think that a scientific theory can't have anything like this in it, but that is not correct.  For example, consider the wavefunction in quantum mechanics.  Here we have an entity in a theory which is not directly observable - even in principle - yet the theory makes very specific predictions.  It is possible to have such entities in a scientific theory, and we accept such entities in so far as the predictions which come from them are observed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a certain appeal to this way of thinking, and I feel that an honest assessment of religious claims could proceed in this way.  However, I think more people use "supernatural" as an excuse, a truly God-of-the-gaps, and stop all inquiry into alternatives.  They see it as an explanation, not a label, but fail to make the next proper step of following the predictions - everything is a post-diction.  You say that the universe is finely tuned for life because of God?  Ok, what suggestion can you make for the next cosmological experiment to perform?  What experiment would you propose to distinguish your theory (with supernatural entities) from a theory of physical necessity (i.e. the constants must be that way) or statistical necessity (i.e. the multiverse)?  You say that the supernatural is needed to understand prayers being answered?  Sure, but how would you test that?  How would you explain the (many) failed experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of prayer, and propose an alternative?  These experiments should be easy to propose, if one is not just applying a God-of-the-gaps.  Of course, we don't see these experiments proposed.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in summary, science cannot test supernatural &lt;em&gt;explanations&lt;/em&gt;, because they are not defined.  They can test specific predictions that incorporate unknown, and possibly unknowable, entities that have direct physical effects.   In most cases of religious claims including supernatural effects there are no predictions made, and thus the term is empty and useless - an excuse for the intellectually lazy.  Where specific predictions have been made (e.g. efficacy of prayer, existence of specific miracles, etc...) the predictions have not been supported.  In this way, science can test God...and God has failed the test. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="articles"></category></entry><entry><title>How to Deflate a Football Deflating Story</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2015/Jan/23/how-to-deflate-a-football-deflating-story/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-01-23T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2015-01-23T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2015-01-23:/posts/2015/Jan/23/how-to-deflate-a-football-deflating-story/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, it's all over the news, the &lt;a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2015/01/20/nfl-says-patriots-used-under-inflated-footballs/7UlPZI3eotRTBadM89saeO/story.html"&gt;Patriots cheated&lt;/a&gt; with deflating the football by 1-2 psi, and are &lt;a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2339195-is-the-nfl-going-to-let-brady-and-belichick-play-it-for-a-fool"&gt;lying about not knowing anything about it&lt;/a&gt;.

There are even claims that there are &lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/science/2015/01/23/deflate-gate-science-underinflated-footballs/"&gt;scientific reasons for this being an advantage&lt;/a&gt;.  What seems to be lacking at this point is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;any actual evidence of wrongdoing - no video, no eyewitnesses, nothing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;any actual &lt;em&gt;data&lt;/em&gt; concerning the footballs in question, i.e. their actual pressures at various times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;any actual &lt;em&gt;data&lt;/em&gt; concerning all of the footballs in the game, i.e. their actual pressures at various times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only data we have is that the balls were measured later in the game, with an observed drop from the beginning of the game, and a possible way to benefit from that.  The first thing we have to ask is, are there any mundane explanations of this observation?  The second thing we have to ask is if there is a way to distinguish between the mundane explanations and the possible nefarious ones.  Let's tackle the first.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="can-temperature-change-account-for-the-data-yes"&gt;Can Temperature Change Account for the Data?  Yes!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When measuring the pressure in a football, we measure the &lt;em&gt;difference&lt;/em&gt; between the pressure inside of the football and the atmospheric pressure.  Atmospheric pressure is about 14.7 psi, so when the reading of the football pressure is, say, 13 psi then the absolute pressure is &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\begin{equation}
14.7 \,{\rm psi} + 13 \,{\rm psi} = 27.7 \,{\rm psi}
\end{equation}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the ideal gas law we also have the relationship between pressure and temperature,
\begin{eqnarray}
PV&amp;amp;=&amp;amp;nkT \\
P&amp;amp;\propto&amp;amp; T \\
\frac{P_1}{P_2}&amp;amp;=&amp;amp;\frac{T_1}{T_2}
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So a change of temperature from 70 F (294 K) down to 40 F (278 K) leads to a drop in football pressure from 27.7 psi down to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{27.7\,{\rm psi}}{P_2}&amp;amp;=&amp;amp;\frac{294 K}{278 K}\\
P_2&amp;amp;=&amp;amp; 26.2 \,{\rm psi}
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or a football pressure reading of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\begin{equation}
26.2 \,{\rm psi}- 14.7 \,{\rm psi} = 11.5 \,{\rm psi}
\end{equation}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perfectly within the range of data that we have access to.  If the amount were much more (4 psi, for example) then we might get suspicious, but this does not seem to be the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="well-thats-nice-in-theory-but"&gt;Well, that's nice in theory, but...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, it seems to work in theory, but we should test it.  Well, &lt;a href="http://www.wcsh6.com/story/news/local/2015/01/22/deflategate-patriots-football-pressure-inflated/22174475/"&gt;someone has&lt;/a&gt;.  He inflated two balls to 13 psi, one in the room and one in the refrigerator.  It went down to 11.7 psi.  He added that someone falling on the ball could also make the ball lose air.  Nice and tidy.  Hearing this, my mind was instantly made up - unless someone can provide actual evidence to the contrary.  Was the interviewer convinced?  Nope - &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Ok, disclaimer time.  Yes, the professor is a Patriots fan, and these sound like a lot of excuses to let the Patriots off the hook.  But he says that this is real scientific stuff."  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it is - and it's not rocket science either.  It's not &lt;em&gt;"excuses"&lt;/em&gt;, it's the most plausible explanation until someone can actually provide evidence contrary to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-do-we-do-with-mundane-explanations"&gt;What do we do with mundane explanations?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have a mundane explanation, what do we do?  We need to require of any other explanation a much more rigourous and strong case - the evidence has to be much stronger than otherwise, because the mundane explanation has a very high prior probability.  Do we have that evidence?  Not that I've seen.  So, until someone shows me the video of a person letting out air from the football, or provides a credible witness, I'm chalking this one up to the typical hysteria Americans like in their news stories and go on with more important things.  Let's hope the NFL listens to the science, and does the same.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="articles"></category></entry><entry><title>Demo vs Experiment</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2015/Jan/20/demo-vs-experiment/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-01-20T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2015-01-20T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2015-01-20:/posts/2015/Jan/20/demo-vs-experiment/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was a judge for a local science fair this past week, and found a number of projects lacking.

After thinking about it for a while, I realized that one of the problems seems to be the distinction (or, rather, lack of distinction) made between &lt;em&gt;demos&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;experiments&lt;/em&gt;.  In teaching science, especially in the younger grades, it seems common to say something like &lt;em&gt;"today we are going to do an experiment, mixing baking soda and vinegar"&lt;/em&gt;.  This, to me, is not an &lt;em&gt;experiment&lt;/em&gt;.  So, what do I think is the difference?  Here are a few thoughts.  Are there any more?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The outcome of an experiment is &lt;em&gt;unknown&lt;/em&gt;, whereas the outcome of a &lt;em&gt;demo&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;known&lt;/em&gt; - deliberately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In an experiments, the variables are &lt;em&gt;quantifiable&lt;/em&gt;, whereas the variables of a &lt;em&gt;demo&lt;/em&gt; are typically discrete and not quantitfiable.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In an experiment, the outcomes are also &lt;em&gt;quantifiable&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To continue with the example, the following &lt;em&gt;demos&lt;/em&gt; would be bad science fair topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what happens when we mix baking soda and vinegar?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;which produces more gas, baking soda and vinegar or baking power and vinegar?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make them true experiments, we could ask&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how does the amount of gas produced with baking soda and vinegar depend on the quantity of baking soda?  (both the amount of baking soda and the amount of gas are quantifiable)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to follow up, how does the amount of gas produced with baking &lt;em&gt;powder&lt;/em&gt; and vinegar depend on the quantity of baking &lt;em&gt;powder&lt;/em&gt;?  Is this the same as the dependence on baking &lt;em&gt;soda&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how many of the "experiments" shown in, for example, &lt;a href="http://www.education.com/science-fair/fifth-grade/"&gt;this science fair site&lt;/a&gt; are actual experiments?  The first few I checked did not meet the criteria above for experiment, but one could possibly modify them to do so.  However, without this guidance, the students are left with a sterile view of science.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="articles"></category></entry><entry><title>We should all be biased</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2015/Jan/05/we-should-all-be-biased/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-01-05T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2015-01-05T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2015-01-05:/posts/2015/Jan/05/we-should-all-be-biased/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A friend and colleague of mine said to me recently that she was nervous that she might become "biased against any new health invention/method/etc... because virtually all of …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A friend and colleague of mine said to me recently that she was nervous that she might become "biased against any new health invention/method/etc... because virtually all of them have been ridiculous".  This is a feeling I've had from time to time, and I've heard it leveled against skeptics from the proponents of these new methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think, however, given the (lack of) performance of the bulk of these claims, ones prior probability - quite rationally - should be low for the next one.  It's not a bias to recognize that, all things being equal, the next silver bullet health claim is likely to be false.  It should, however, be very easy for a health treatment &lt;em&gt;that actually works&lt;/em&gt; to redeem itself above this prior probability.  The criticism of "bias" is raised only when the treatment hasn't actually been demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term bias is tricky depending on its usage. In many ways, bias is perfectly rational, if it means assuming something is false before the evidence.  Does one say that a jury is biased against the guilt of the suspect?   I think this sentence points to the fact that the word "bias" is typically used in a pejorative fashion, synonymous with being resistant to evidence.  Even here, resistant to evidence is rational to the extent that stronger evidence is needed to raise a lower prior probability.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps "bias" should mean willing to ignore some of the evidence against ones present view, in order to maintain this view.  This can come innocently in the form of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias"&gt;confirmation bias&lt;/a&gt;, and not be a deliberate distortion.  Clearly this violates the &lt;a href="http://oneecologistsview.blogspot.com/2012/06/basic-desirderata-jaynes.html"&gt;axioms of probability&lt;/a&gt;, and should be avoided.  Proper scientific thinking and process is constructed specifically to avoid this sort of bias, while at the same time supporting the rational forms of bias.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="articles"></category></entry><entry><title>LaTeX vs Word</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Dec/31/latex-vs-word/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2014-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2014-12-31:/posts/2014/Dec/31/latex-vs-word/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Reading &lt;a href="http://serialmentor.com/blog/2014/12/27/post-publication-review-of-the-plos-one-paper-comparing-ms-word-and-latex-how-not-to-compare-document-preparation"&gt;this review&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0115069"&gt;PloS One comparison&lt;/a&gt; between MS Word and &lt;a href="http://latex-project.org/ftp.html"&gt;LaTeX&lt;/a&gt;, I was struck by how much it resonates.

There are many things that I do in both (or, more precisely, in Pages rather than Word) depending on the application.  There are things that &lt;a href="http://latex-project.org/ftp.html"&gt;LaTeX&lt;/a&gt; can do much better than any other solution I have found, none of which is touched in the &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0115069"&gt;PloS One comparison&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, some things that could not be done in Word or Pages without a ton of work, are mentioned in &lt;a href="http://serialmentor.com/blog/2014/12/27/post-publication-review-of-the-plos-one-paper-comparing-ms-word-and-latex-how-not-to-compare-document-preparation"&gt;the review&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up 50 numbered equations, refer to them throughout the text, then change the equation order.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have figures and their captions float to appropriate locations at the top or bottom of pages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the order of figures in a document and fix all references to those figures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The referencing (figures, equations, and bibliography) is one of the strong points of &lt;a href="http://latex-project.org/ftp.html"&gt;LaTeX&lt;/a&gt;.  I see how much time my students spend on this in Word, and it completely erases the time-savings of Word.  I would add the following as well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Programatically change the content of the document - for example, I've had flags to change mathematical notation, and flags for the student vs teacher versions of a document&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easily generate &lt;a href="http://latex-project.org/ftp.html"&gt;LaTeX&lt;/a&gt; formatting from a script - I've written Python scripts to make tedious, large tables, and write them in &lt;a href="http://latex-project.org/ftp.html"&gt;LaTeX&lt;/a&gt; to be included in &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Nov/21/statistical-inference-for-everyone-sie/"&gt;my book&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organize multi-part documents, with references, into multiple files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Separate my thinking into separate content and layout modes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm the first to admit that the learning curve of &lt;a href="http://latex-project.org/ftp.html"&gt;LaTeX&lt;/a&gt; is pretty steep, but once you know it, it really offers advantages for &lt;em&gt;complex&lt;/em&gt; documents.  For simple ones, it doesn't stack up to an easier program, but isn't that the case with most powerful tools?  At that point, as &lt;a href="http://serialmentor.com/blog/2014/12/27/post-publication-review-of-the-plos-one-paper-comparing-ms-word-and-latex-how-not-to-compare-document-preparation"&gt;the review&lt;/a&gt; also suggests, it makes more sense to write things in &lt;a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax"&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt; - which this blog is written in.  So MS Word lands in that area of too-complex for simple documents and too-simple for complex documents.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="articles"></category></entry><entry><title>The Longest Night Ever</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Dec/23/the-longest-night-ever/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-12-23T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2014-12-23T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2014-12-23:/posts/2014/Dec/23/the-longest-night-ever/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently saw a claim that this past December 21 was the longest solstice night ever...in the history of the planet!

When I first heard this, and when I have told others, the first reaction is puzzlement - "why is this &lt;em&gt;particular&lt;/em&gt; Solstice special?", "how could it be that in the 4.5 billion years of the planet I would be here for this unique event?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, although unique, this is not an unusual event - the Earth is slowing down its spin, due to the interaction with the Moon.  Thus, each year, &lt;strong&gt;every day&lt;/strong&gt; is just a smidgen longer - about 20 millionths of a second each year.  So next year's Solstice will be the longest in the history of the planet as well, as was every Solstice in the past (at the time).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I find interesting is the habit of people to infer specialness so quickly when faced with a puzzle.  It is also interesting that once one understands the process, that specialness is immediately eliminated, and replaced with a more cosmic picture.  There is a direct parallel with all times in our history when we have (falsely) inferred the specialness of people - the heliocentric Universe, the distinction between humans and animals, Earthly vs Celestial material, organic vs inorganic life, etc...  This should serve as a reminder to us all to be skeptical of claims of specialness before understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the positive side, those people who keep wanting more hours in the day need only wait and it will happen automatically! &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="articles"></category></entry><entry><title>Why Python is the language everyone should learn</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Dec/15/why-python-is-the-language-everyone-should-learn/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-12-15T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2014-12-15T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2014-12-15:/posts/2014/Dec/15/why-python-is-the-language-everyone-should-learn/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have been a fan of the &lt;a href="http://www.python.org"&gt;Python programming language&lt;/a&gt; for many years.

It was encouraging to me lately that there are two articles about Python, reiterating many of my experiences, and teaching me some things I was unaware of.  The first, about &lt;a href="https://www.paypal-engineering.com/2014/12/10/10-myths-of-enterprise-python"&gt;myths about Python&lt;/a&gt; and its use in large-scale applications, was a real eye-opener.  I've never had to scale my apps up, or have high security, so I had implicitly bought into the two myths that Python was not suited for the job.  Nice to know I was wrong!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other, about someone's &lt;a href="http://allhailtothepenguin.blogspot.com/2014/12/after-years-of-c-and-java-i-chose-python.html"&gt;programming journey away from C and Java to Python&lt;/a&gt;, mirrored &lt;a href="https://web.bryant.edu/~bblais/pdf/python_matlab.pdf"&gt;my own experience&lt;/a&gt; somewhat.  For me, it was coming off of Matlab, and finding that I could do all of what Matlab offered and much more.  At one time, I rewrote Matlab, Perl, Sed, Awk, and Jed scripts all in Python - being able to think in one language as opposed to five was a huge boon to productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my experience, Python is the easiest language for a beginner to learn, and it is one of the most powerful languages I've ever worked with.  I've been able to get a few of my colleagues hooked on Python over the years, and have yet to find a problem for which it is not well suited.  Even this website is written in Python!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="articles"></category></entry></feed>
