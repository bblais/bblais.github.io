In this interview he starts off by answering the fairly straightforward question "what is Bayes theorem and how does it relate to our understanding of evidence?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bayes theorem is a way of probabilistically modeling our assessment of evidence and how we update our confidence and conclusions in response to new data so the way that a Bayesian  would conceptualize evidence is in terms of a likelihood ratio that is to say the probability of the evidence existing given the hypothesis is true on the numerator and then on the denominator we have the probability that that same evidence exists given that the hypothesis is false and to the extent that that likelihood ratio is top heavy that is the extent to which you have evidence for your hypothesis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I find astounding about this opening response is the massive hole that Jonathan leaves -- the prior.  He addresses it later, but if you're specifically asked about Bayes Theorem and you only talk about likelihoods, that is a serious omission.  If I were asked the question, I would have answered it as I did in my &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3xAb3aVGVM0"&gt;TEDx talk on the issue&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bayes theorem states that a belief in a particular explanation should scale with &lt;em&gt;how well that explanation fits the data&lt;/em&gt; (called the likelihood),  it should also scale with &lt;em&gt;how plausible that explanation was before you saw any data&lt;/em&gt; (the prior), and it should be scaled down by all of the alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why does this opener strike me as bad?  There are two reasons.  The first I mentioned already, the lack of mentioning a prior.  We can see the result of ignoring the prior by examining the example McLatchie says here, one that &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2022/Jan/24/ongoing-conversation-with-jonathan-mclatchie/#enter-jean-luc"&gt;he has used before&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;imagine that you were hiking in a forest in somewhere and you're far away from roads and civilizations and you come across a cabin in the middle of this forest and you wonder whether it is inhabited and so you decide to inspect and you prize open the door and you find a cup of English breakfast tea that that is still steeping, it is not at room temperature,  on the table inside this cabin.   On the hypothesis that the cabin is inhabited would you have predicted strongly that you would find a cup of specifically English breakfast tea still seeping on this table? Well, no, it's actually quite a low probability on the hypothesis that it's inhabited that you would make that observation nonetheless it is far more probable on the hypothesis that the cabin is inhabited that you would make that observation than it would otherwise be if the cabin is not inhabited -- then it's astronomically improbable that you would make that observation. So again you have this, even though the numerator is not particularly high, you nonetheless in this case have a very strongly top-heavy likelihood ratio such that the evidence overwhelmingly confirms the hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my earlier response to this (where McLatchie used Earl Grey tea in his examle), I introduced the hypothesis that Jean Luc Picard had visited and everyone knows that he likes his &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2IJdfxWtPM"&gt;"tea, Earl Gray, hot"&lt;/a&gt;.  Because of this, the likelihood of the evidence on this hypothesis is much higher than either of the alternatives that McLatchie gives -- does this mean he strongly believes in Jean Luc Picard?  What's the problem?  McLatchie consistently ignores priors.  I do wonder if he changed the type of tea because of my response.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second problem with the opener has to do with alternatives.  Through rest of the interview he deals only with ratios, and he naively mentions independence,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if the initial ratio were 2 to one then if you had 10 pieces of such evidence and they were all independent then the cumulative power of the evidence would be more than 1,000 to one and so you can see that if you have lots of different pieces of evidence each by themselves not being a particularly great weight they can amount to cumulatively a very powerful cumulative case for the hypothesis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What he says is mathematically correct if 1) you have only one alternative and 2) if the data is indeed independent.  The first comes from a naive application of Bayes theorem, and ignoring the fact that &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2022/Jan/18/bad-apologetics/#bayes-factors-and-confidence"&gt;some non-monotonic effects can occur when you have more than two hypothesis&lt;/a&gt;.  The second is often stated and, except for some obvious simple cases, is no often true.  Even if there is a small uncertainty in whether you can establish data points as independent &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2023/Feb/23/probability-and-the-independence-of-testimony/"&gt;you can come to radically different answers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The net effect of ignoring, or downplaying, priors and only working in two-hypothesis problems is to sweep these sorts of complexities under the rug.  Applying Bayes in these cases also distracts one from the fact that the hypotheses McLatchie is proposing &lt;em&gt;makes no unique predictions&lt;/em&gt;.  Go through everything McLatchie has said, and note how many times he has proposed an experiment to test directly the design hypothesis -- it's zero as far as I can tell, not just for McLatchie but for all of the ID proponents.   They will try to point out that a particular evolutionary mechanism can't explain a phenomenon, but they never put forward the positive case.  It is the classic God-of-the-Gaps move.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since McLatchie himself says he's not doing God of the Gaps and is putting forward a positive case, I feel that this topic requires its own response which I will work on later.  Until then, the deficiencies in the way that he describes Bayesian probability and applies Bayes theorem itself are cause to doubt his conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="religion"></category></entry><entry><title>What would I expect to be in the Bible?</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2023/Dec/02/what-would-i-expect-to-be-in-the-bible/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-12-02T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-12-02T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2023-12-02:/posts/2023/Dec/02/what-would-i-expect-to-be-in-the-bible/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've read the entire Bible twice, the &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2023/Aug/14/bible-in-a-year/"&gt;most recent time this past year&lt;/a&gt;.

Both times I was underwhelmed by the content in the book.  It had so much barbarism, and was barely inspiring even at its best points.  I wrote in my notes &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There is nothing in the Bible that even suggests that the person writing this knew more than me or anyone else in history, let alone an omniscient being.  If someone could point to anything in this book that indicates omniscient input, I'd love to hear it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what would I expect?  I don't know specifically, but when I read a newsletter by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolyn_Porco"&gt;Carolyn Porco&lt;/a&gt; an idea struck me.  Here was a mere mortal, one of 8 billion, writing something more inspiring and prescient while being entirely accurate, communicating a message of thanks that far surpasses anything in the Bible.  If this can be done by mere people, why do we think this couldn't have been accomplished in spades by an all-knowing being who supposedly created the universe?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow will be Thanksgiving Day in the US ... the day that we Americans pause to express thanks for all those things that make our lives and our time on this planet meaningful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To take reckoning of your own life, and all the wonder-filled moments and events, both personal and not, and the opportunities and knowledge -- yes, knowledge! -- you have gained from them, and to dwell on and be grateful for all of it, is a salve for the heart and soul. One of the most effective practices of gratitude for me starts outdoors, on a clear, dark night, gazing up at a starlit sky and absorbing its message. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I repeat here what I wrote on Facebook on Dec 20, 2022, prior to the Great Conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn two days later:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Be sure to spend some time reveling in the rarity of the moment, the beauty of the starlit skies of our planet, the antiquity of the Universe, and how fortunate we all are to have the celestial wonders that surround us ... our planetary neighbors, the very distant stars and nebulae in our own galaxy, all the billions upon billions of immensely distant galaxies ... laid out before our eyes in such glorious splendor. The night sky is the only scene we can savor that is 13.8 billion years old. No experience can better convey the profundity and significance of our own limited existence and the improbable blessing of being alive, than gazing, with knowledge and acceptance, upon its starry countenance."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is enough gratitude to be had in that magnificent view and what it has taught us to last a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that tomorrow and be sure to have a Happy Thanksgiving! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you have …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;An "undesigned coincidence" is used in an argument for the reliability of the Gospels, notable by Jonathan McLatchie, Tim McGrew and Lydia McGrew, and &lt;a href="https://jonathanmclatchie.com/yes-richard-carrier-there-are-undesigned-coincidences-part-1/"&gt;is defined as&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have multiple (at least two) accounts that report an event where one account answers in passing a natural question raised incidentally by the other.  Such features are &lt;em&gt;evidence&lt;/em&gt; that a real event lies behind the reports found in the gospels — that is to say, the presence of an undesigned coincidence is more probable given the hypothesis of historicism than given the annulment of that hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've written about one &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2022/Jul/11/why-undesigned-coincidences-are-not-compelling-to-me/"&gt;undesigned coincidence (UC) here&lt;/a&gt; but it has come up in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fomPHLGCpiA&amp;amp;list=WL&amp;amp;index=3&amp;amp;t=832s"&gt;discussions on YouTube&lt;/a&gt; so I felt I needed to talk about them a bit more.  Some of these UC are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the grass being green is mentioned in Mark at the time, and it's Passover time mentioned in John, and each of these is mentioned only in one Gospel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus turned to Philip to ask what is to eat when they were near Bethsaida&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How did they know the exact number of people there (i.e. 5000)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why did Jesus warn the blind man not to say anything to anyone?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list might go on, but these are the sorts of pieces of evidence that the apologists are using.  Each of these have reasonable plausible explanations in literary or oral tradition relationships.  With the green grass example why couldn't the oral tradition have had the events around passover (with or without green grass) and Mark adds green grass as a literary flourish or John drops it? It'd be like a common story around Christmas, and one author mentions Christmas and the other snow. It doesn't seem to require, or even hint at, eyewitness testimony. It's so indirect -- like all of these undesigned coincidences -- when it would have been much more straightforward for Mark to have said "My name is Mark and I was there when...."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the Philip-Bethsaida "coincidences", couldn't there have been a tradition that Philip was from Bethsaida? He could easily have been known as "Philip from Bethsaida" in the oral tradition, to keep him straight from other Philips.  If there was such a tradition, then any event that took place in Bethsaida, or was claimed to take place in or near Bethsaida, might have had Philip inserted as a primary character. This seems pretty natural, and wouldn't require any eyewitnesses, or the truth of any of those events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example -- counting the 5000. What if the number has nothing to do with the count, and is a reference to the Old Testament, like 2 Chronicles or Joshua where they refer to "5000 from the flocks" or "5000 men"? or perhaps because it's a nice round number (like the 500 eyewitnesses in Paul) and could have been chosen for that reason. I see no strong reason to think this number was an actual count, so this "undesigned coincidence" doesn't seem to be a coincidence at all, but (like many of these, I suspect) may be due to overactive pattern seeking.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, we're told, this is a cumulative case -- explaining one is ok, but having to have separate explanations for all of them, the apologists claim, strains credulity.  However, we have the following problems.  Now, this is like the third "undesigned coincidence" that I've looked at, and come up with a plausible reason for it in about 5 seconds of thinking. What does that do to the probability I'd assign to the next three I look at? Especially given 1) how trivial finding plausible alternatives is and 2) the entire mode of argument would be made moot if the Gospels followed the standards of ancient history and cited their sources, were clear about their authorship, and gave some specifics about the events.  One can find some cases of ancient historians not doing this, but it seems to be incredibly uncommon and frowned upon even in ancient times.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't have time nor the expertise to go through each and every one of the so-called "coincidences", but they all strike me initially as being completely -- and trivially -- understood as being produced by a common process and are not strong evidence that the events actually happened.  Even in theory, I don't see how one can use these UC to rule out literary or oral tradition sources for them when they exist at all.  This entire approach seems to me to be a combination of cherry picking and seeing patterns in random data, both of which are common cognitive fallacies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="what-if-im-wrong"&gt;What if I'm wrong?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so what if I'm wrong, and 1) UC actually exist in the Gospels and 2) one can use UC to establish eyewitness reporting?   This isn't an issue, because I could easily be convinced.  What apologists are proposing is that,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UC are well-defined&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can observe them in ancient texts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Their existence is strong evidence of eye-witness testimony&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I am proposing is,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UC are not well-defined as a category, but may be argued individually&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We might be able to see some UC in the Gospels and other ancient texts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In addition to the apologists claim of possible eyewitness testimony, UC can also be explained with mostly mundane explanations, including (but not limited to):&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;literary dependence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;oral tradition dependence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;actual coincidence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;legendary development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;overactive pattern finding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;multiple ways the "coincidence" could occur&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One should be able to easily make a test to distinguish between these two possibilities.  One should be able to establish, perhaps with modern texts, perhaps with ancient texts, that &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one can define UC in such a way that they can be unambiguously identified in any text&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use UC to unambiguously distinguish between fictional and non-fictional sources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use UC to unambiguously distinguish between eyewitness accounts and those accounts which rely only on 2nd, 3rd, 4th-hand accounts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that a search for the topic of undesigned coincidences only comes up with Christian apologetics sources points to the fact that this study has not been done, and I see no indication in the apologetics literature that Christians think this is a worthwhile endeavor.  It's like the faith-healing literature -- they don't want to do the hard work of actually establishing that their method does the job they claim it does, and would rather just stick with their claims and think that the skeptics are being unreasonable.  This is not how any scientist thinks, and I await the study I describe to be done.  In the meantime, I feel completely comfortable not taking undesigned coincidences seriously, because Christian apologists are clearly not taking it seriously either. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="religion"></category></entry><entry><title>Bible in a Year</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2023/Aug/14/bible-in-a-year/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-08-14T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-08-14T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2023-08-14:/posts/2023/Aug/14/bible-in-a-year/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I listened to the &lt;a href="https://media.ascensionpress.com/category/ascension-podcasts/bibleinayear/"&gt;Bible in a Year podcast with Fr.

Mike Schmitz&lt;/a&gt; where Fr. Mike Schmitz reads the entire bible across 365 days.  I had read the Bible before, many years ago, but having it in audio format had a few advantages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you can "read" the Bible while doing other things -- mowing the lawn, driving, etc...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you don't skip through the long lists of names and the repetition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you hear explanations of the readings, especially reminders of difficult person- or place-names or when the story repeats from a previous chapter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the way I took random notes and cross-checked some things with other sources and I am collecting these notes here for anyone interested.  I didn't write about every single day (frankly, some of my responses got repetitive) but I did write across the entire year.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://bnspcatholic.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/the-official-365-day-reading-plan-for-the-bible-in-a-year.pdf"&gt;full schedule of the podcast can be downloaded here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where I refer to "commentary" or to "Fr. Mike Schmitz" I'm referring to the analysis after each reading.  The format of each day is a short intro (mostly the same), the reading, and then a commentary.   Here's the TLDR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I really do appreciate Fr. Mike Schmitz's earnestness and his sense of humor. Even though I don’t agree with nearly anything he says, in terms of content, I do thank him for the amount of time and effort that he put into this and his honest communication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is nothing in the Bible that even suggests that the person writing this knew more than me or anyone else in history, let alone an omniscient being.  If someone could point to anything in this book that indicates omniscient input, I'd love to hear it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don’t think I will ever do this again. It’s an incredible amount of time even with the advantage of the podcast.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am unclear about the lessons in the Bible -- there is an incredible amount of barbarism which, in any other book, I would have stopped reading.  Even the lessons of Jesus are suspect, and the repetition is incredibly inefficient.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As one reads the notes below, there is a lot of justification given for things that are clearly terrible.   Again, if any other book said these things there is no way a moral person like Fr. Mike Schmitz would put forward such justifications and rationalizations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-1-genesis-12-psalm-19"&gt;Day 1  - Genesis 1–2 Psalm 19&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is nothing in the creation narratives that even suggests that the person writing this knew more than me, let alone being omniscient.  there is no hint of other planets, of heliocentrism, of galaxies -- even though that would have been trivial for a god to communicate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The entire story sounds like Aesop's fables, or other ancient creation myths.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The commentary said that this creation account is unique in the ancient world because the world was not created out of fighting or sexual interaction.  this is just not true, as the Genesis story is a slight change from some of the Babylonian creation accounts (the Ionians had stories just like this).  what makes it Jewish is that it reinforced the 7-day week, so that Jews in exile would still keep the Sabbath.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-2-genesis-34-psalm-104"&gt;Day 2 - Genesis 3–4 Psalm 104&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who was the honest one and who was dishonest in the story of Adam and Eve?  It's clear that the snake (which is nowhere stated to be either Satan or Lucifer) is honest whereas Yahweh is not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apparently the use of the word "snake" here is related to Tiamat or Levaiathan -- the great sea creature, also known as the agent of chaos.  The ancient creation myths often have god (or gods) of order fighting chaos.  Even in genesis, it is God who lays out the order over the waters (not ex nihilo).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was reading this, I also listened to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy_2FMlTSHI&amp;amp;list=PL4P20nug29iy5BsrXBlpK3YMcbUKYQnV0"&gt;Robert M Price's 9-part Genesis Study&lt;/a&gt;, where I got most of what I know about the ancient creation myths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-3-genesis-56-psalm-136"&gt;Day 3 - Genesis 5–6 Psalm 136&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hearing the genealogies and the start of the Noah story, I wonder where all the people came from since it started with two (Adam and Eve) and both Cain and Seth came from Eve, so where did their wives come from?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also, wouldn't god know that the flood wouldn't solve his problems?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-4-genesis-79-psalm-1"&gt;Day 4 - Genesis 7–9 Psalm 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Of course there's all the ridiculousness of the flood, making it clearly a myth, but I want to focus on another piece. There's a point where it says when one sheds man's blood that one's blood will be shed by man.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%209%3A6&amp;amp;version=ESV"&gt;Genesis 9:6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Whoever sheds the &lt;strong&gt;blood&lt;/strong&gt; of man, by man shall his &lt;strong&gt;blood&lt;/strong&gt; be shed, for God made man in his own image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commentary says this is a prohibition against murder. But I think it's pretty clear that it's not a prohibition against murder, but rather an endorsement of blood revenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-5-genesis-1011-psalm-2"&gt;Day 5 - Genesis 10–11 Psalm 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So the Tower of Babel story seems to be another one of these Aesop's fables, or just so stories. God comes down to confuse them deliberately, because they are being successful, and then the spin in the commentary is all about how their success was because of lust for power, and not just for excellence. It's amazing how these commentaries paint everything in a positive light rather than a straightforward reading of the text. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's also interesting that Enoch, who lives 365 years has the same properties as the sun gods in the Assyrian and Babylonian mythologies, including being taken up to heaven, and conquering the flood. In this way, Robert M Price suggests that Enoch was probably the original hero of the flood story and the story was rewritten for Noah. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another interesting point is the mention of the "sons of God", and the "daughters of men", which are parallel to the existence of Demi-gods and huge warriors, such as Gilgamesh, and serves as the origin of evil in the world. The story comes right before the flood, and serves as a justification for the flood. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also interesting is that there are two flood stories interweaved. One version talks about 150 days and to buy two of every single animal. The other version includes clean and unclean animals, which, if the later parts of the Bible are believed, this distinction shouldn't have happened until Moses -- the kosher laws didn't exist until Moses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also, the flood story in the epic of Gilgamesh is remarkably similar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the really weird story about Noah, getting drunk and his son Ham seeing him I never noticed that Noah's response was to curse Canaan. Robert M price suspects that there is something that isn't actually said that has been omitted, and that Canaan, who is Ham's son may have done whatever terrible thing or the original story had Canaan as the fourth son. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-9-genesis-1819-job-78-proverbs-21-5"&gt;Day 9 - Genesis 18–19 Job 7–8 Proverbs 2:1-5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Got Covid so no responses for a while.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots of circumcisions.  None of this sounds like an all-knowing being writing or inspiring this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why all this animal sacrifice?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The name, Isaac, means "one who laughs". Which is a literary nod to Abraham laughing.   &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also the story with Abraham arguing with God just sounds ridiculous to me right now.  Although, there is a treatment of this scenario which explores the idea of being good without God in the Beyond Belief 2006 Conference, with &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/bq3L5Ezk_Es?t=272"&gt;Susan Neiman's presentation&lt;/a&gt;.  In this treatment, the moral reasoning of the story is explored thoughtfully, but I get the feeling that one could read this sort of thing into nearly any story.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lot gave his daughters to protect the men who came?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still this story sounds like just-so stories -- explaining why a city was destroyed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is up with the story of Lots daughters sleeping with him?  Weird!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those countries are enemies of Israel so maybe another just so story&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From Robert M Price -- apparently it was a common practice for a priest or shaman to help infertile women conceive (presumably by sleeping with her either with or without husbands permission). This is related to the many pagan stories of gods impregnating women.   My addition -- the connection to the Jesus story is pretty obvious here.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-11-genesis-2223-job-1112-proverbs-29-15"&gt;Day 11 - Genesis 22–23 Job 11–12 Proverbs 2:9-15&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So I learned from Robert M Price that there is a parallel story for the Isaac and Abraham story, coming &lt;a href="https://www.greeklegendsandmyths.com/phrixus.html"&gt;from Greece&lt;/a&gt;. In this story, there was a king (Athamas of Boeotia), with a son named &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrixus"&gt;Phrixus&lt;/a&gt;.   Apparently the son was from his first wife, but his second wife, after the first wife died, was discontent and wanted her own son with the king be the heir. So she arranged to have the priest make up a fake decree that the firstborn son had to be sacrificed. The king took the son out, and just before the blade struck he was stopped by Hercules, who said that Zeus does not want human sacrifice.  He then provided a ram as a replacement, and then the king and the son came back home.  This story either exists at the same time or earlier than the one in the Bible, it's pretty incredible that there's such a parallel story at the same time.  This means that one copied from the other or they both were part of a soup of stories, where you had common themes across many cultures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-13-genesis-2526-job-1516-proverbs-220-22"&gt;Day 13 - Genesis 25–26 Job 15–16 Proverbs 2:20-22&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Joseph story is a retelling of the Osiris-Horus story. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a side comment, there are so many times where I believe in the translation on this podcast they just say "the Lord" in different sources, where the originals used different name, e.g. Yahweh, Elohim, etc...  In the text sometimes a different font is used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Esau and Isaac are both Sun gods, and Jacob is a moon God.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many of the stories are retellings of other stories of these gods made into stories about people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-32-exodus-9-leviticus-7-psalm-49"&gt;Day 32 - Exodus 9 Leviticus 7 Psalm 49&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talking about how God hardens pharaoh's heart, and how this is not about taking away his free will came up in the commentary, which is really pretty lame. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, they say God is all good and perfect, even though the story doesn't sound like that at all like not even remotely. He's bragging about how he's showing off his power   He's being petulant and even his power seems pretty weak. I'm pretty sure I could think of other ways to demonstrate power that would not involve frogs and locusts. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But anyway back to the hardening of the heart. The analogy Mike Schmitz uses is of wax and clay in the sun. You have something like wax which softens in the heat of the sun and you have something like clay, which hardens in the heat of the sun. So when God hardens pharaoh's heart it is just that pharaohs heart has a propensity to harden in the presence of God and God is not   eliminating the free will of the pharaoh.  I'm not convinced by this analogy, but it is at least an attempt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God says "I have made sport of the Egyptians".   I'm pretty sure &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcion_of_Sinope"&gt;Marcion&lt;/a&gt; had it correct when he said that the God of the Old Testament, Yahweh, was not the same God as the God Jesus is talking about.  It's hard to imagine Jesus of the story endorsing such barbarious actions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-34-exodus-12-leviticus-9-psalm-114"&gt;Day 34 - Exodus 12 Leviticus 9 Psalm 114&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So the story here is of the Passover where God kills the firstborn of all the Egyptians. And then father Mike Schmitz says that this was 100% justice that God is 100% just. And the reason that this is "just" was because pharaoh didn't let the people go, and he was warned that this was going to happen. Doesn't matter what happened to the babies it seems! That doesn't seem like justice to me. That seems like petty retribution. Why didn't God just punish the pharaoh directly? Why does he have to punish other people? Why does he have to punish innocence? This is not justice. But those who take this document as the inspired word of God have to say that this is justice and turn off their moral compass. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-39-exodus-21-leviticus-14-psalm-75"&gt;Day 39 - Exodus 21 Leviticus 14 Psalm 75&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The commentary has the typical apologetic that the slavery at that time was more like an indentured servitude.  It is suggested that you would give your services because you're too poor.  However, Fr Schmitz doesn't seem to recognize that the Bible clearly states many times that the slaves are your property and you can hand them down as such and that the girls are your sex slaves. It ignores the totally immoral laws like if you beat your slaves and they don't die immediately and they live for a few days you will not be punished because the slave is your property. This apologetic is what you get when you blindly believe that this book has to be perfect, or has to be entirely correct and you have to bend over backwards and ignore your own morality in order to make these ridiculous arguments. Frankly, it's disgusting.   I mean ask yourself the question is it ever, in any context, justifiable to own someone as property?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fr Schmitz goes further, giving excuses for God, that the people in the stories don't really know him, and that the gods around are unfair, and God's coming from a place of justice.  This is very hard to tell from the rules God's giving. That somehow the fact that these were more barbaric peoples is an excuse for basically talking down to them. This is God, who can supposedly make entire universes. And you're saying he can't find a way to convince people who are used to slavery that, "hey, maybe owning people as property should be one of the more important of the 10 Commandments"?  He seems to be able to convince them to do all sorts of crazy animal sacrifices, and not to have blended fabrics, and this is beyond him? The excuse making is just outrageous, and repugnant, given the nature of the material in these books.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fr Schmitz does say that God has to come down to the level. The analogy is that you would not criticize a first grader for doing arithmetic while you're doing calculus. The problem is that there were other cultures at that time that actually had moral systems superior to this, so it clearly wasn't beyond these people.  It's just as an excuse that is being given for this outrageous book. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fr Schmitz literally says that the slaves are not your property in his explanation of indentured servitude. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exodus 21:20-21: 20 “Anyone who beats their male or female slave with a rod must be punished if the slave dies as a direct result, 21 but they are not to be punished if the slave recovers after a day or two, &lt;strong&gt;since the slave is their property.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's these kind of morally repugnant stances that make me want to stop listening to this podcast.  What he's doing is reading &lt;em&gt;into&lt;/em&gt; the text what he &lt;em&gt;wants it to be&lt;/em&gt; and not actually reading what it says. I would think that would be blasphemy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-40-exodus-22-leviticus-15-psalm-76"&gt;Day 40 - Exodus 22 Leviticus 15 Psalm 76&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots of male discharges. 😂🤮&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This really is the best that God can do? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-41-exodus-23-leviticus-16-psalm-77"&gt;Day 41 - Exodus 23 Leviticus 16 Psalm 77&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exodus 34:26 You shall not boil a young goat in its mother’s milk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Glad I got that one stated -- I was just about to do that! 😀&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-42-exodus-24-leviticus-1718-psalm-78"&gt;Day 42 - Exodus 24 Leviticus 17–18 Psalm 78&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's all rules about who can sleep with whom, mostly prohibition against incest. Mike Schmitz makes a point that there are some rules that are eternal (moral laws) and some rules that are specific to the Jewish people or to the temple (temple laws). So the example of mixed fabrics is something that passed away because Israel passed away. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Makes me wonder then what is the status of the 10 Commandments?  Are such laws eternal given that most do not have to do with moral questions. It also makes me wonder about the rules about stoning your daughter who is not a virgin. The social rules have to be moral rules, right? I doubt that the Bible is very specific about these things. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-48-exodus-3334-leviticus-24-psalm-80"&gt;Day 48 - Exodus 33–34 Leviticus 24 Psalm 80&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exodus 34:26 You shall not boil a young goat in its mother’s milk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A direct command by God, seemingly more important than "you should not own people as property."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-49-exodus-3536-leviticus-25-psalm-81"&gt;Day 49 - Exodus 35–36 Leviticus 25 Psalm 81&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots of putting people to death for various transgressions. It's really hard to imagine a God of peace and justice saying these things. Again I'm thinking the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcion_of_Sinope"&gt;Marcionites&lt;/a&gt; had correct.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There's a lot of Aoife (actually ephah, which is a measurement in Israel). I'm not sure what the word actually is but it's a measure of some kind of grain or liquid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And we have more stuff about slavery in this one, including a case where someone said, if your brother is poor, you can take him as a servant, but not a slave and he can work and repay things and then go back to his family. This seems to go against the idea that "slavery" refers to indentured servitude in all contexts, because this is an example where it is contrasted, almost specifically, with indentured servitude&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And the fact that the book specifies how to treat slaves from Israel versus slaves from other countries goes against the interpretation that slavery is indentured servitude&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fr Schmitz also says that the reason that things repeat is because you repeat the important things. I think we can pretty much dispense with that idea, because there are many things that repeat that are really not that important.  It seems much more reasonable that things repeat because they came from different sources that were cobbled together and in some cases they merged the stories and in other cases they just put them back to back, not wanting to get rid of any particular source.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This entire discussion about slaves is really terrible and wrong. First Fr. Schmitz is saying that this is the only way God could have done this -- by essentially endorsing slavery temporarily, possibly so that these people can grow, even though there were people in other countries who did not have slaves even at that time. Seems like he's selling God short and have a lack of imagination. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The problem with all of this is that if you assume that this book is written by the creator of the universe, who is all-just and all-good, you will have to bend your own morality into knots. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fr. Schmitz says that the Bible is good and true, but sometimes you have to read between the lines. What that means is that you read what you want to read. It's more like reading around the lines. He said that there are many churches that try to guess what God wants -- seems like this is what he's doing as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The idea that a God would &lt;em&gt;want to be worshiped&lt;/em&gt; seems perverse to me. How can any thinking being want to be worshiped?  Why would they want a creation of theirs to worship them? for me I can't imagine making something myself and then wanting to have it worship me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-56-numbers-5-deuteronomy-5-psalm-90"&gt;Day 56 - Numbers 5 Deuteronomy 5 Psalm 90&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is really interesting to hear Fr. Schmitz bending over backwards to justify the use of idols in the Catholic Church and how it’s not a violation of one of the commandments. Now I don’t really care one way or another whether it’s true, but it does show that you can twist any text to mean pretty much the opposite of what it says.  This particular case is just such a great example of that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-61-numbers-11-deuteronomy-10-psalm-33"&gt;Day 61 - Numbers 11 Deuteronomy 10 Psalm 33&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deuteronomy 10:16 - 16 Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no longer stubborn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What a great and odd phrase "foreskin of your heart"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-70-numbers-22-deuteronomy-23-psalm-105"&gt;Day 70 - Numbers 22 Deuteronomy 23 Psalm 105&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So we get a story of a talking donkey.  Is this a book we need to take seriously?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-71-numbers-23-deuteronomy-2425-psalm-106"&gt;Day 71 - Numbers 23 Deuteronomy 24–25 Psalm 106&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There’s a quote about being put to death only for your own sin, which I think is indirect contradiction to the idea of original sin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deuteronomy 24 - 6 Fathers shall not be put to death because of their children, nor shall children be put to death because of their fathers. Each one shall be put to death for his own sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-84-joshua-1011-psalm-128"&gt;Day 84 - Joshua 10–11 Psalm 128&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fr. Schmitz discussing the sun standing still as possibly against science, and then he sites Galileo incorrectly, and says that it was more about ego versus ego, rather than about faith versus science. But then he says that Copernicus, who was also a priest had already made that observation of a heliocentric solar system, and there was no backlash against him. What Fr. Schmitz fails to realize is that Copernicus did not publish his work until after he died &lt;em&gt;because he was afraid of the backlash.&lt;/em&gt;  He knew there would be a backlash.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fr. Schmitz then refers to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle_of_the_Sun"&gt;Fatima miracle&lt;/a&gt; as being similar.  Or he says it could be allegorical.  Seems to me that if this is allegorical why not the entire story?  Also the &lt;a href="https://cdn.centerforinquiry.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/29/2009/11/22164423/p14.pdf"&gt;story of Fatima has its own issues&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-97-1-samuel-35-psalm-150"&gt;Day 97 - 1 Samuel 3–5 Psalm 150&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Samuel%203%3A1&amp;amp;version=ESV"&gt;1 Samuel 3:1&lt;/a&gt; Now the boy Samuel &lt;strong&gt;was&lt;/strong&gt; ministering to the &lt;strong&gt;Lord&lt;/strong&gt; in the presence of Eli. And the word of the &lt;strong&gt;Lord&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;was&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;rare&lt;/strong&gt; in those days; there &lt;strong&gt;was&lt;/strong&gt; no frequent vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a really interesting quote and reminds me of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Origin_of_Consciousness_in_the_Breakdown_of_the_Bicameral_Mind"&gt;Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-99-john-13-proverbs-51-6"&gt;Day 99 - John 1–3 Proverbs 5:1-6&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Gospel of John says “truly truly I say to you“ so many times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s interesting that Jesus overturned the temple in John Chapter 2 and not at the end as in the other Gospels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Gospel of John, he is constantly saying that he is the Son of the Father and the Father works through him and the Father and I are one. I don’t think this happens in Mark.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-130-2-samuel-12-1-chronicles-16-psalm-51"&gt;Day 130 - 2 Samuel 12 1 Chronicles 16 Psalm 51&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have a lovely story about David committing adultery that was in the previous day and in this day he’s punished by God. How is he punished? The baby that he was having with his current-wife was killed.  After the readings, Fr. Mike Schmitz talks about how God loves you and wants to set you back on the right path and all I could think of was "what about that baby?" Is that baby going to hell? Did God love that baby? Did that baby deserve what happened? Was David actually punished? The morality of this book is pretty atrocious. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I get about a week behind, and then I binge a number of episodes. The problem is one of motivation is because the Bible is such a painful book. There is no indication that anyone smarter than ancient goat herders wrote this thing. I can’t even tell most of the time what the message is supposed to be, or even if there is supposed to be a message. What’s the point? The interpretations seem strained at best.  It’s just so hard to spend any time on this stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-153-1-kings-11-ecclesiastes-1012-psalm-9"&gt;Day 153 - 1 Kings 11 Ecclesiastes 10–12 Psalm 9&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it seems that Yahweh likes punishing some for the sins of others.  Solomon started following other gods, so Yahweh decides to break up the kingdom -- but not while Solomon is alive, but to his son.  This all seems like someone writing to explain why a sequel kingdom failed by attributing the failure to the sins of Solomon.  I think this is a super common theme at this point in the Bible -- when things go well, they attribute it to God, when things go badly, they attribute it to the missteps of the leaders with respect to their service to god.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still, there has been absolutely nothing that &lt;em&gt;even hints&lt;/em&gt; at an omniscient writer or influencer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-161-mark-1516-psalm-22"&gt;Day 161 - Mark 15–16 Psalm 22&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fr. Schmitz says that Psalm 22 is so close to what Jesus went through that it was prophecy.  It seems so clear to me that Mark wrote the Psalm into the story.  How could you tell the difference?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This version of the Bible had the long version of Mark that I hadn’t heard.  It has the handling snakes and drinking poison parts.  Interesting that the actual Gospel ends with sending the women out and "they said nothing to anyone".   &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fr. Schmitz also says that it is an amazing sacrifice for God to have his son killed but I thing David Smalley puts it best as "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmlatsb8-VA"&gt;a bad weekend at human camp&lt;/a&gt;".  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-165-1-kings-1516-2-chronicles-1617-song-of-solomon-4"&gt;Day 165 - 1 Kings 15–16 2 Chronicles 16–17 Song of Solomon 4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There’s a point where Fr. Schmitz says that God doesn’t need these animals that are sacrificed. But it is a symbol of their trust in him, because those are the most valuable things that they sacrifice. Perhaps that's a metaphor that Jordan Peterson could make something out of. You need to sacrifice yourself to others, or to the greater good. It doesn’t mean anything unless it’s an actual sacrifice of something that’s meaningful to you. But I think as a statement of reality, I just don’t see the wisdom of it. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-166-1-kings-1718-2-chronicles-1819-song-of-solomon-5"&gt;Day 166 - 1 Kings 17–18 2 Chronicles 18–19 Song of Solomon 5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So there’s a showdown between Elisha and the prophets of Baal. He proposes a test, which of course Yahweh succeeds. It makes me think that if Yahweh was totally fine with this sort of test in the past why can’t we do it now? Why did they say you should not test the Lord thy God? And yet such stories occur in the Old Testament. Did God change?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-169-1-kings-22-2-chronicles-23-song-of-solomon-8"&gt;Day 169 - 1 Kings 22 2 Chronicles 23 Song of Solomon 8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seems as if God sends a lying spirit to the prophets of the enemy to undermine them.  How is that at all different than God lying himself?  How would you ever know if the prophets you have are telling the truth if this is a live option?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Song of Solomon seems to really like pomegranates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-170-2-kings-1-2-chronicles-24-psalm-69"&gt;Day 170 - 2 Kings 1 2 Chronicles 24 Psalm 69&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Psalms, it talked about giving vinegar to drink as a prophecy for the story of Jesus, and it makes me wonder if you were making the story of Jesus and you had only the Old Testament stories to go on, how much of the Jesus story would you be able to make? It almost seems as if the New Testament is fanfiction of the Old Testament. The miracles of Elisha seem very similar. The Psalms give almost every part of the crucifixion story. So if you were to say, write fanfiction in the style of the Old Testament, but set in the Roman time, you would pretty much get exactly the Gospel of Mark.  Just add some legendary embellishments, and some appearances and things like that and you get the other gospels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-171-2-kings-2-2-chronicles-25-psalm-70"&gt;Day 171 - 2 Kings 2 2 Chronicles 25 Psalm 70&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have the story of the Bears sent to kill 42 children because they called Elijah "baldy".  And in the name of the Lord, this was done. What are we to make of a story like that?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another one that reiterates the message that has occurred in a number of places, that the descendants of someone will not be killed for the transgressions of their ancestors. And yet we get the opposite message many times, because God seems to punish the children and the children’s children for the transgressions of the ancestor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fr. Schmitz has a pretty impressive dodge of the she-bear story. He essentially says that it may not be young boys, but could be young men -- basically ruffians -- and it wasn’t about an insult. It was about proper worship of God versus improper worship of God given where they were in the north as opposed to the south. I still think the moral argument against the story runs no matter what, but I find it really interesting that he has to do these contortions to try to get out of a fairly straightforward story and its consequences. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-173-2-kings-4-2-chronicles-28-psalm-127"&gt;Day 173  - 2 Kings 4 2 Chronicles 28 Psalm 127&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There’s a story of one of the kings of Judah, where he set up molten offerings to the old gods and sacrifices his own sons. In the commentary, Fr. Schmitz relates to the stories and comes very close to saying that it was terrible that the king sacrifices his sons in this way.  This would then clearly call into question the story of Jesus, so  Fr. Schmitz says the problem is not that he sacrificed his sons but that he sacrificed his sons &lt;em&gt;to the wrong God&lt;/em&gt;. It is very interesting hearing the contortions again trying to avoid saying anything bad about Jehovah.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-174-2-kings-5-hosea-13-psalm-101"&gt;Day 174 - 2 Kings 5 Hosea 1–3 Psalm 101&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fr. Schmitz  says that one of the common messages for the prophets is warning North Israel to change the ways or else God will let them go. He then stresses that this is not in conflict with God's patience being infinite, but that the story comes to an end just like our life comes to an end, and that we get whatever we’ve chosen and we get that for eternity. And I’m wondering why does it have to be like that? Why over such a tiny amount of time are we judged for eternity? Why not do it in a more gradual way? The first hundred years and then you get some kind of signal and then the next hundred years and another one?  Or maybe it should be like in &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4955642/"&gt;The Good Place&lt;/a&gt;? It just seems that Fr. Schmitz is insistent on making sure his view of God is  reasonable &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-182-2-kings-16-micah-14-psalm-139"&gt;Day 182 - 2 Kings 16 Micah 1–4 Psalm 139&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what way is the king sacrificing his sons is any worse than God sacrificing Jesus?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-183-2-kings-17-micah-57-psalm-140"&gt;Day 183 - 2 Kings 17 Micah 5–7 Psalm 140&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally an interesting tidbit.  The kingdom of Samaria of the north was broken up into five nations. Then in Jesus, his story about the woman who is the Samaritan, he says that she has had five husbands before and the one she is with now it’s not her husband. It just shows that so many stories are not just morality tales. They are literally drawn from aspects of the Old Testament stories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And then we having Micah prophecy of the one who will come from Bethlehem. Of course Fr. Schmitz takes this as prophecy but it’s so much easier to understand it, as the New Testament writers simply reading the Old Testament in writing stories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have to say that I really haven’t learned a whole lot from reading the Bible. I feel as if I could’ve learned just as much in a much shorter way.  This is the reason why I just want to get it done so I can say that I did it. This is not a meditation for me really.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-185-2-kings-19-2-chronicles-30-psalm-143"&gt;Day 185 - 2 Kings 19 2 Chronicles 30 Psalm 143&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There’s a story or prayer about how the Syrians are attacking a particular city, and a prayer states that God will not allow them to take the city.  There’s a story about how an angel of the Lord came down and wiped out much of the Syrians and the rest got sent home.   It seems as if they are in every single case when the people have a victory it’s God's doing, and when they have a defeat it’s because the people failed to do something. This is classic religious thinking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-195-isaiah-78-tobit-79-proverbs-105-8"&gt;Day 195 - Isaiah 7–8 Tobit 7–9 Proverbs 10:5-8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have the Isaiah so-called prophecy,  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 7 - 14 Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say "so-called" because the sign is for military victory for the king, and it actually happens &lt;em&gt;in the next verse&lt;/em&gt;.  There’s no hint at all that this was meant to be a prophecy for the future. It is much more reasonable to think that someone looking for details to put into the New Testament story would latch onto this and add it to the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just for reference, there is a long list of failed prophecies online:  &lt;a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Biblical_prophecies#Failed.2FUnfulfilled_prophecies"&gt;https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Biblical_prophecies#Wrong_prophecies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-197-isaiah-1113-tobit-1314-proverbs-1013-16"&gt;Day 197 - Isaiah 11–13 Tobit 13–14 Proverbs 10:13-16&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have a number of statements about the rise and fall of various countries, many of which are  true, some of which are demonstrably false. This really causes us to question the entire idea of prophecy in the Old Testament.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-202-isaiah-2324-habakkuk-12-proverbs-111-4"&gt;Day 202 - Isaiah 23–24 Habakkuk 1–2 Proverbs 11:1-4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 24 - Behold, the Lord will empty the earth[&lt;a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+24&amp;amp;version=ESV#fen-ESV-18097a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;] and make it desolate,  and he will twist its surface and scatter its inhabitants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They claim that the Earth will be scorched and bunch of things happen to "the Earth" but why is there not any mention of China or the Americas or any other lands other than the local lands of the author?  Did God not know about these?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-213-isaiah-4748-ezekiel-89-proverbs-1213-16"&gt;Day 213 - Isaiah 47–48 Ezekiel 8–9 Proverbs 12:13-16&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Son of man term used in a vision.  Not sure what this means&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have to say that these prophets are super tiring.  It’s the same message again and again.   Praise god for his greatness.  Israel, you’ve stopped following him and follow false gods and you will be or are being punished.  Rinse repeat repent.   &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-218-isaiah-5758-ezekiel-1718-proverbs-135-8"&gt;Day 218 -   Isaiah 57–58 Ezekiel 17–18 Proverbs 13:5-8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ezekiel 18:20 - 20 The soul who sins shall die. The son shall not suffer for the iniquity of the father, nor the father suffer for the iniquity of the son. The righteousness of the righteous shall be upon himself, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell that to everyone who has original sin.  Geesh.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another common theme in the prophets is how God will bring his people back to Israel from the scattered places, and there everyone will live happily ever after.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-223-isaiah-66-ezekiel-2526-proverbs-141-4"&gt;Day 223 - Isaiah 66 Ezekiel 25–26 Proverbs 14:1-4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The prediction that Tyre will be forever destroyed.  Let’s ask the people who live there today.  😀&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-241-jeremiah-2425-daniel-67-proverbs-165-8"&gt;Day 241 - Jeremiah 24–25 Daniel 6–7 Proverbs 16:5-8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God is going to show his wrath over the whole earth. All of the inhabitants of the earth. Of course, none of this is written in any other continent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-243-jeremiah-2829-daniel-1011-proverbs-1613-16"&gt;Day 243 - Jeremiah 28–29 Daniel 10–11 Proverbs 16:13-16&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;About Daniel 11, Fr. Schmitz says that the prophecies are so great that skeptics say it had to be written after the fact.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just after writing that last comment I read &lt;a href="https://infidels.org/library/modern/chris-sandoval-daniel/"&gt;another author talking about Daniel&lt;/a&gt;.   I wanted to see how it was dated. There is this gem:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many critical scholars attribute the obvious historical errors of the book of Daniel to naïveté. I find it more likely that the author generally knew what he was doing and wrote honest anachronistic inspirational fiction, the literary equivalent of the faith-promoting &lt;em&gt;Left Behind&lt;/em&gt; series of our own time. His friends and contemporaries already expected God to set up the messianic kingdom very soon in their own lifetimes, and his cycle of short stories regarding Daniel merely gave literary expression to their preexisting beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-251-jeremiah-4142-judith-1214-proverbs-1713-16"&gt;Day 251 - Jeremiah 41–42 Judith 12–14 Proverbs 17:13-16&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So we are finishing up the book of Judith. And essentially it’s a story about this Jewish woman who goes and infiltrates the Assyrians and devises a way to be alone with the leader, and then chops his head off delivers the head to the Jewish people so that they can win. They claim that God is with them and hasn’t left them. What am I supposed to learn from this? As far as I can tell this is yet another barbaric story from a barbaric people justifying their barbaric actions by saying that God is with them.  Is this really the best that an omnibenevolent, omnipotent, omnipresent agent can do? There’s just no hint that this is inspired by anything greater than the barbaric people that they’re talking about.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m reminded about some thing Matt Dillahunty had said about how religion distorts morality. The theist always claims that the source of morality is God and that you can’t be moral without God. Or they say that the atheist is either not moral or borrowing it from religion. But when I look at this, we pretty much have an act that is directly murder. It is a violation of one of the 10 Commandments. It is immoral. It is brutal. And then it is celebrated. And then Fr. Schmitz has the audacity to say things like Judith‘s virtuousness was never lost. Her purity was never lost. And that this murderous act was a theme with several other cases where someone chopped off their head or put a spike through their head, or Mary steps on the head of the snake. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pretty much if you can argue an action and it’s direct opposite are both moral then you have lost your way. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not sure if I mentioned this but way back when when they were list of names in the Vhronicles, Fr. Schmitz said something about he had a prayer where he was thanking God and he mentioned how these names were important, even though we only had a name and we didn’t know anything else about them. The problem with that is that if they were important, then we would have more than just names, and the fact that we only have the names really does speak to the level of ineptitude of the communication with ancient books. It also speaks to the fact that Fr. Schmitz is going to say everything is important in this book whether it seems so or not. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-259-matthew-57-proverbs-1821-24"&gt;Day 259 - Matthew 5–7 Proverbs 18:21-24&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is the one with the sermon on the mount. I’m reminded of &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/i2V5ZWVUpn8"&gt;Matt Dillahunty’s covering of the Sermon on the Mount&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes from that video follow here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The early part of the sermon essentially says that while things are bad now, they will get better -- either in this life or the next&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This makes it so that people are less likely to try to get out of bad situations -- it helped keep women and slaves in marginalized positions for centuries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Matt 5:7-9 - a naive reward system for good behavior.  Be merciful so that you'll get mercy from god, etc...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10-12 -- Encourages divisiveness through the expectation of persecution.  When they think they are being persecuted (either correctly or incorrectly) they believe they are doing the right thing by God&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Matt 5:16 says let your light shine.... Matt 6:1 says the opposite, and is confusing at best&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5:21-26: Thought crimes as equivalent to murder.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5:27-28: More thought crimes, lust is not adultery.  Also it's sexist (whomsoever looks at a woman lustfully) -- why is God sexist here?  Same with 31-32.  Also bad advice -- suffer through marriages that don't include infidelity, no matter how bad they are.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5:37 - Good advice, keep your word. of course the "don't swear oaths dictate" is not followed by Christians -- they swear on bibles, etc...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;38-39: Justice doesn't have to fall on the extremes of vengeance and pacifism.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encourages victimization.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;43-44: Love your enemies is not reasonable or practiced (even by Jesus who will torture enemies forever)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Matt 6:6 -- pray in private.  good advice that is not taken.&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"proper adherence to this verse implies that prayer shouldn't be in school at all it means that we shouldn't be swearing people and on Bibles shouldn't open city council meetings with prayers we shouldn't have a Christian television network public prayer meetings the National Day of Prayer etc Christians who support these goals are hypocrites they're willfully disobeying a direct order that they believe is from Jesus it's not like they're disobeying Paul or John this is supposed to be the words of their Savior and they chuck it aside proving that they are their own God making their own rules&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6:25-34: Live for today, God will take care of you.  Bad advice.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7:1-6: Don't be a hypocrite -- good advice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't cast your pearls before swine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7:12: Golden rule is not original with jesus, or the Old Testament.&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Jesus's version while fairly good is actually one of the poorer versions I've seen. Saying "do unto others what you would have them do to you" isn't nearly as wise as "do unto others as they would have you do unto them".   I might like somebody to be brutally honest with me but they might prefer that I sugarcoat my words and it's better to treat them in the way that they want and encourage them to treat you in the way that you want"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there are other things other sayings that may be even better like "strive to do as much good as possible and as little harm as possible". Why didn't Jesus say something like that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Matt 7:15-23 the second part contradicts the first.  Either you are judged by your works or you aren't.  It also calls into question the belief necessity for salvation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-261-matthew-1113-proverbs-195-8"&gt;Day 261 - Matthew 11–13 Proverbs 19:5-8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 12 - 38 Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered him, saying, “Teacher, we wish to see a sign from you.” 39 But he answered them, “An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. 40 &lt;strong&gt;For just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you look at the resurrection narratives this doesn't add up (you can see &lt;a href="http://localhost:8000/search.html?q=resurrection"&gt;my posts about the Resurrection here&lt;/a&gt;) -- Friday night to Sunday morning is not "three days and three nights"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus was asked why speak in parables, and he essentially gave the classic conspiracy theory answer, which is so that you would have secret knowledge, and the others would be ignorant. This is one way that groups that share conspiracy theories maintain their community by giving its members the illusion that they have secret knowledge that no one else has. This may have helped Christianity to spread. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fr. Schmitz says that in the story there are those that saw miracles and didn’t believe. So if you think that you’ll believe if you see a miracle that may not be true. At least for me if I see a verified miracle I would at least pay attention. Otherwise, how can I possibly take any of this stuff seriously?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-262-matthew-1417-proverbs-199-12"&gt;Day 262 - Matthew 14–17 Proverbs 19:9-12&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seems as if the Peter "on this rock" quote is omitted in the Gospel of Mark?  seems like an odd omission.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-266-matthew-2728-proverbs-1925-29"&gt;Day 266 - Matthew 27–28 Proverbs 19:25-29&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So the story with Barabbas, which means "son of the father" and a parallel with Passover it makes it so obvious this is a &lt;em&gt;literary construction&lt;/em&gt; and not historical. Also, the resurrection description in Matthew has guards and an angel and the rolling away of the stone and all this other stuff which Mark does not mention.  (you can see &lt;a href="http://localhost:8000/search.html?q=resurrection"&gt;my posts about the Resurrection here&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are the Saints coming out of their graves and wandering around the town something that Mark wouldn’t have wanted to write about?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-271-ezra-910-zechariah-911-proverbs-2016-19"&gt;Day 271 - Ezra 9–10 Zechariah 9–11 Proverbs 20:16-19&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zechariah 9 - Behold, your king is coming to you;&lt;br&gt;
    righteous and having salvation is he,&lt;br&gt;
    humble and mounted on a donkey,&lt;br&gt;
    on a colt, the foal of a donkey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zechariah 11:13 Then the Lord said to me, “Throw it to the potter”—the lordly price at which I was priced by them. So I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them into the house of the Lord, to the potter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Here in the Old Testament, we have the riding in on a colt, the foal of a colt and even have 30 pieces of silver reference. I wonder how many of the New Testament stories are literally just re-reading older Old Testament stories. The loaves and fishes seems to come from Elijah, all of the crucifixion narratives seem to come from the Psalms.  It’s actually impressive what little there is left if you take away all of the Old Testament stories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although most of my comments are negative, there are a number of good things about this particular podcast. First, I really like the commentary and the fact that Fr. Schmitz repeats a lot of who the names are and warns you about things that are confusing.  It’s also very useful to be an audio format so that you can listen to it when you’re driving or you’re just doing yard work or something that is mindless so that way you can focus on the text. I find that I won’t tend to skip forward where, if I’m reading, I might skim or skip passages. It’s also interesting because I was brought up Catholic but my recent exposure has been with fundamentalist evangelicals and so hearing the Catholic interpretation of some of the passages is pretty interesting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, I find that much of this is a waste of time. The book is so repetitive and doesn’t have a lot of content. I could’ve probably gotten the content in less than a 10th of the time if it was presented in a different way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the nice things about the Bible in a day is that it breaks up the books and reads from several in a day.  Things like proverbs or the long list of names in chronicles is more valuable reading a small amount per day rather than going through in order.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-280-nehemiah-12-esther-911-proverbs-2121-24"&gt;Day 280 - Nehemiah 12 Esther 9–11 Proverbs 21:21-24&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we have a story about Esther, who is a Jew, and is also queen and some people arrange to have all the Jews killed, so what does she do? She goes to the king and has a guy who organized that executed and then the king organizes essentially a mass slaughter of everyone who was against the Jews. This is one barbaric story after another one,  One side doesn’t like the other side so they’re going to kill them all and then then whoever has the power just kills the other people.   I mean it’s just a ludicrous story if you’re trying to get any kind of moral message out of this. Is this really the best that the creator of the universe, the all-good God can arrange?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Son of god, Prince of peace, Ushered in the good news of the world.  These terms were applied to Caesar Augustus, before Jesus came. And Fr. Schmitz spins this as setting the stage for Jesus.  It seems more likely that these terms were simply lifted, and applied to Jesus so that people would make the connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-291-1-maccabees-10-sirach-2627-proverbs-235-8"&gt;Day 291 - 1 Maccabees 10 Sirach 26–27 Proverbs 23:5-8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots of stuff about the good wife. This is in the book of Sirach.  So Fr. Schmitz spins this as talking about both wives and husbands, or at least applicable to husbands as well. It’s pretty amazing when the book says something and you don’t like it you just make up that it says something different.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-305-2-maccabees-8-wisdom-56-proverbs-2430-34"&gt;Day 305 - 2 Maccabees 8 Wisdom 5–6 Proverbs 24:30-34&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fr. Schmitz says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"it is difficult to see God's working in our lives, what is he really doing?  Is this God's justice, is this just an accident of evil, is this part of his mercy?  But to have the eyes that are looking to see, eyes looking to understand, but they always are the eyes of trust.  Here's what I mean.  Sometimes we can say 'Gosh I think I must have done something wrong to be experiencing this pain, or maybe I'm being corrected by the Lord himself.'  But we dont have any idea why, we're just guessing at this.  So it's kind of sometimes a risk to look at our lives and say 'This is what God is doing' but it is not a risk to say 'God is present and active'.  Hopefully that make sense.  I don't always know, God what are you doing in this moment but be able to say 'God I know that you're here and you're doing &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;'.  That is something we can really rest on, that is where the trust comes being able to say this is not you abandoning me, Lord, this is not you giving up on me this is not being disqualified from your word or from  your promises, but you're here and you're active.  you're present and you're doing something.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there anything you couldn't believe using thinking like this?  Is this a way to think that brings you closer to truth, or to confirmation bias, and exaggerated pattern recognition?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 Maccabees and 2 Maccabees are interesting -- I haven't read them before.  I'm noting most of the New Testament names, which undermines Bauckham's thesis.  2 Maccabees has the same stories but interpreting all of them as God acting.  There are some stirring stories of martyrdom in 2 Maccabees.  Still a lot of repetition, and wishful thinking, and post-hoc rationalizations.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So they say that parables are a common way for rabbis to communicate. They draw people in. I think another reason is that they are vague enough to be interpreted in multiple ways so they’re more flexible. I think that Christianity's success has more to do with the fact that one can apply the messages to any situation. Fr. Schmitz also commented how the visitation to Mary of John the Baptist's mother parallels second Samuel 6 -- a number of the phrases are the same. Again much more Old Testament being used to construct the stories for the New Testament.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-314-luke-35-proverbs-2527-28"&gt;Day 314 - Luke 3–5 Proverbs 25:27-28&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The census in the gospel of Luke makes no sense. There’s no way that you would be called back to the town &lt;em&gt;of your ancestors from 800 years ago&lt;/em&gt;. That’s just ludicrous.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The lineage is also problematic. It disagrees with Matthews and it has different numbers of generations and it disagrees &lt;em&gt;even on the grandfather&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-319-luke-1719-proverbs-2613-16"&gt;Day 319 - Luke 17–19 Proverbs 26:13-16&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parable of the rich man. One of Fr. Schmitz’s responses is that it’s not about just  hearing the word of God it is about acting on the word of God . I think that’s a pretty good statement for pretty much any reading or life advice, or anything else. It’s not enough to just read advice -- you need to act on it. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-320-luke-202238-proverbs-2617-19"&gt;Day 320 - Luke 20–22:38 Proverbs 26:17-19&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Listening to Jesus, his description of the destruction of the temple sounds a lot like the various prophets in the Old Testament. Especially when he says this generation will not pass before they see the kingdom of God coming again. Essentially the things that the author knew about and wrote down are correct and the things in the future that are predicted and are not correct. It’s actually amazing how it follows that same pattern. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s also interesting to see that the form of the predictions are all the same. Essentially decrying the bad behavior of the people and God coming in and enacting punishment  This is followed by a prediction that God is going to come back and beat all the bad guys and everyone will live happily ever after. Except of course the bad guys.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-321-luke-22392450-proverbs-2620-23"&gt;Day 321 - Luke 22:39–24:50 Proverbs 26:20-23&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The robber on the cross.  "Today you will be with me.""  But isn’t Jesus dead for three days?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The two travelers on the road to Amaus has a direct parallel with Roman story about Romulus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots of appearances where he wants to demonstrate that he has a body -- while at the same time disappearing and walking through walls. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a contrast between the directions Jesus gives on where to meet afterward -- Luke says Jerusalem and Matthew says Galilee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-322-acts-1-romans-1-proverbs-2624-26"&gt;Day 322 - Acts 1 Romans 1 Proverbs 26:24-26&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Robert M Price describes Acts as the Catholic response to Marcione.  Essentially the goal is to take people who like Paul, and say that Peter is just like Paul. And to take people who like Peter and say, Paul is just like Peter.  Essentially whitewashing the real disagreement between these two different groups of original Christians -- the ones that were all for the adherence to the Jewish laws (including circumcision) and those that were not.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acts of the Apostles has a different reason for why the field of blood is called the field of blood. This has to do with Judas hangING himself, and his guts spilling all over the field as opposed to the field being purchased by the blood money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-324-acts-3-romans-45-proverbs-271-3"&gt;Day 324 - Acts 3 Romans 4–5 Proverbs 27:1-3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So there’s a story about Peter healing someone who can walk. This happens all the way up to the temple. Fr. Schmitz asked why is he coming up to the temple? That is because they’re Jews and that the old law is still in effect. So part of the goal of that is to counter the Christian sect of the Marciones, who believed that the Old Testament God was not the same God that Jesus was talking about.  So these reminders about Peter's Judaism is also part of the plan to make Peter palatable to those who are fans of Paul.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-326-acts-5-romans-8-proverbs-277-9"&gt;Day 326 - Acts 5 Romans 8 Proverbs 27:7-9&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acts of the Apostles just feels like propaganda for the Christian church. The stories of them being thrown in jail and then escaping with an angel. The back and forth with the elders and the Sadducees,  and at no point do we have anyone looking for a dead body. Given an empty tomb, one of the major things that would’ve happened, would be a search for grave robbing, of which the disciples would be the number one suspects. We get no sense of that at all. We also get no sense of having Jesus's family appearing anywhere.  Like where is Mary right now? Also, it wouldn’t matter whether the cell was locked -- the people no longer in it would also be reason for them to get thrown into a more secure location.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Listening to the letters of Paul I have this very strange feeling. I hear the words, but I get no contact at all. I feel like I’m learning nothing at all from what he saying, as if he’s saying nothing at all, a string of &lt;a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Deepity"&gt;deepities&lt;/a&gt;. He goes around and around and I don’t even know what his point is. It’s pretty wild. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-328-acts-7-romans-1112-proverbs-2713-14"&gt;Day 328 - Acts 7 Romans 11–12 Proverbs 27:13-14&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So I started watching &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/B5MUUP4l6l4"&gt;Richard Carrier's video about Acts as Historical Fiction&lt;/a&gt; and there are a number of very interesting things. He claims that Mark was written first and essentially was putting forward the idea that Christianity was not just for Jews. And this is seen with one of the themes about the least shall be most and it subverts expectations. Then Matthew comes along as a response to Mark and essentially says no no no no you have to be Jewish and he highlights all the Jewish things that Mark did not do. Then Luke comes along as a response to Mark. Carrier says that the Q document doesn’t actually exist and it’s not well supported  -- that Luke is actually a response to Matthew. And in Luke’s Gospel he’s trying have the perspective that  you don’t need to be Jewish to be Christian -- but really trying to make the two sides see eye to eye. And then Acts is  propaganda to really try to merge those two perspectives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-336-acts-15-1-corinthians-1112-proverbs-2810-12"&gt;Day 336 - Acts 15 1 Corinthians 11–12 Proverbs 28:10-12&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fr. Schmitz says that scripture clearly states that men and women are equal. I really don’t understand where that could possibly come from.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-345-acts-24-galatians-13-proverbs-2912-14"&gt;Day 345 - Acts 24 Galatians 1–3 Proverbs 29:12-14&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In his letter to the Galatians, Paul writes that he did not receive the gospel from any man, but only by Revelation. He then talks about his trip to Arabia right after, and he didn’t go to Jerusalem for quite a while, which is in conflict with story in Acts. It also highlights his disagreements with Peter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-348-acts-27-ephesians-46-proverbs-2922-24"&gt;Day 348 - Acts 27 Ephesians 4–6 Proverbs 29:22-24&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So Fr. Schmitz comments that when you go on a trip and you get some adversity, you’ll have to question whether you should be on that trip at all. And then he contrasts that with Paul who has all sorts of problems on his trips, but says that this is God’s will, and so was able to see those hardships in a new light. This is actually a good attitude to have and I think the stoics have the same attitude, but without all of the superstition. So the point is that the Christian faith is not always problematic. It has some good things and it has some advice that does actually help you through adversity.  When you feel like you’ve messed up, Christianity offers you a way to feel forgiven and move on. These are all very good things but they come at the cost of believing a whole bunch of false things. The ideal would be to somehow obtain the benefits of those things without believing false things. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-362-revelation-1214-hebrews-14-proverbs-3119-22"&gt;Day 362 - Revelation 12–14 Hebrews 1–4 Proverbs 31:19-22&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fr. Schmitz tells the story of the miracle at Guadalupe.  I doubt things happened the way he says but I’ll look into it.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-365-revelation-2122-hebrews-1113-proverbs-3130-31"&gt;Day 365 - Revelation 21–22 Hebrews 11–13 Proverbs 31:30-31&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So I’m done. Fr. Schmitz actually cried when he said goodbye on the last day. I really do appreciate his earnestness and his sense of humor. And even though I don’t agree with nearly anything that he says, in terms of content, I do thank him for the amount of time and effort that he put into this and his honest communication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So this is the second time I’ve gone through the Bible.  The first time I read it using a student Bible so I could understand what was going on but I felt that I skimmed a number of things and then paused to consider some of the stories.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I like the fact that I did it once as text and once being read to me. I think both have value. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don’t think I will ever do this again. It’s an incredible amount of time. The advantage to the podcast is that you can be doing other things at the same time so it’s a bit more efficient time-wise but either way it is a big investment in time and I just don’t find the text itself to be very efficient in terms of the lessons that it’s trying to give . And I think that means that people just don’t read it. It’s probably good to read through once, but I am not going to do this again. However, I will read passages here and there and I will keep responding to religious claims where I see them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is my hope that I go through my notes here and compile them together so that I have a response to doing the Bible in a Year .&lt;/li&gt;

In a number of debates, but more famously &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/a-wIaCRIdOA?feature=share"&gt;this one with Jonathan McLatchie&lt;/a&gt;, Matt Dillahunty states that "claims are not evidence".  It became so heated that it led to the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/a-wIaCRIdOA?feature=share&amp;amp;t=4763"&gt;infamous rage-quit by Johnathan&lt;/a&gt;.     &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/a-wIaCRIdOA?feature=share&amp;amp;t=8755"&gt;Matt later clarifies&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;propositions&lt;/em&gt; are never evidence, and he's separating the idea of a claim from its context (i.e. the person stating it). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there were a number of Twitter threads like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pasted image 20230326194340.png" src="https://bblais.github.io/images/Pasted image 20230326194340.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt="Pasted image 20230327100056.png" src="https://bblais.github.io/images/Pasted image 20230327100056.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/OjtMYgCgLYo"&gt;Paulogia weighs in&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like most of these arguments, it comes down to the definitions and being very careful with the vocabulary.  Let's start with the definition of evidence from the &lt;a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evidence/"&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the following probabilistic explication of what it is for &lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt; to be evidence for &lt;em&gt;H&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt; is evidence for &lt;em&gt;H&lt;/em&gt; if and only if Prob(&lt;em&gt;H&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt;) &amp;gt; Prob(&lt;em&gt;H&lt;/em&gt;).[&lt;a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evidence/notes.html#23"&gt;23&lt;/a&gt; ]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, &lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt; is evidence for &lt;em&gt;H&lt;/em&gt; just in case the conditional probability of &lt;em&gt;H&lt;/em&gt; on &lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt; is greater than the unconditional probability of &lt;em&gt;H&lt;/em&gt;. Thus, the fact that &lt;em&gt;the suspect's blood is on the knife&lt;/em&gt; is evidence for the hypothesis that &lt;em&gt;the suspect committed the murder&lt;/em&gt; if and only if the probability that the suspect committed the murder is greater given that his blood is on the knife than it would be otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt; is evidence against &lt;em&gt;H&lt;/em&gt; if and only if Prob(&lt;em&gt;H&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt;) &amp;lt; Prob(&lt;em&gt;H&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, &lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt; is evidence against &lt;em&gt;H&lt;/em&gt; just in case the conditional probability of &lt;em&gt;H&lt;/em&gt; on &lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt; is less than the unconditional probability of &lt;em&gt;H&lt;/em&gt;. Thus, the fact that &lt;em&gt;the suspect's fingerprints are not on the knife_is evidence against the hypothesis that _the suspect committed the murder&lt;/em&gt; if and only if the probability that the suspect committed the murder is lower given the absence of his fingerprints on the knife than it would be otherwise. Within this probabilistic model, verification (in the sense of conclusive confirmation) would involve bestowing probability 1 on an hypothesis while falsification would involve bestowing probability 0 on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with the word "claim" is that it seems to combine both the proposition (which is not evidence) and the fact that a person is making the claim (which can add some degree of evidence). This is a matter of usage. If you can substitute in your sentence the word "proposition" for "claim" then it will not be evidence. But in a sentence like "Matt claims to have a dog" you can't do that, so the word is mixed and thus may be evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposition “it’s five o’clock” is non evidential. Someone saying it - even if they are conveying a “fact” - does carry evidence. A fact is just that thing which has a high posterior probability. Someone making it a statement is just a recognition that for that person they have a high posterior for that statement and thus don’t feel compelled to defend it. In English if you said “So and so &lt;em&gt;claims&lt;/em&gt; that it is 5 o’clock” there is an implied negative -- it implies that you don’t believe them. I think that’s because in most cases where someone says it is 5 o'clock, that it is such a mundane claim (priors are high) and it is unlikely that someone would lie or be seriously mistaken (alternatives are unlikely) that we need not question the high the posterior. When we stress the word &lt;em&gt;claim&lt;/em&gt; in the sentence, it implies the negative.  The reason why someone gets upset at having to defend it doesn’t have anything to do with the statement-claim distinctions and everything to do with the implied conclusion of this questioning: you think they are either lying or seriously mistaken on a trivial statement/claim. They would take offense at that — rightly so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now someone making the statement “Jesus rose from the dead” they may actually believe it as a fact. Is this a claim or statement? Does it provide evidence? I’d say this is a claim like the ones above but does not provide evidence for the claim because the prior is super low and the alternatives could be made more likely given this statement and no other evidence (because many people make similar statements and have always been shown wrong). This means that the statement/testimony may not increase the posterior (it may in fact lower it).  Again, I don’t see the useful distinction between statement and claim except perhaps as a label where, perhaps, a statement is an indication of a high prior and a claim focuses more on the likelihood part of the probability?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="religion"></category></entry><entry><title>The "God" of the Philosophers Is Empty</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2022/Jul/23/the-god-of-the-philosophers-is-empty/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-07-23T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2022-07-23T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2022-07-23:/posts/2022/Jul/23/the-god-of-the-philosophers-is-empty/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I recently had a bit of a discussion which ended somewhat abruptly with complaints of category errors on my part and implied scientism.

&lt;p&gt;https://twitter.com/dryapologist/status/1548281913873313792
&lt;img alt="Pasted image 20220723111528.png" src="https://bblais.github.io/images/Pasted image 20220723111528.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To which I replied:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pasted image 20220723111600.png" src="https://bblais.github.io/images/Pasted image 20220723111600.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then @MetaChristianity posted in seeming exasperation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pasted image 20220723111642.png" src="https://bblais.github.io/images/Pasted image 20220723111642.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;@MetaChristianity then references &lt;a href="https://lastedenblog.wordpress.com/2016/06/06/god-vs-the-gods/"&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt; to point out my "category error".  The post summarizes the difference between the "God" of the so-called "serious theists" and what I was apparently responding to.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any serious discussion about theism, it is absolutely crucial to distinguish between God and the gods. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you don’t understand this distinction, you will literally never understand what serious theists are talking about&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is, by definition, the Absolute. The one, absolute, unconditioned ground and source of all that is; the Alpha and the Omega, as Christian scripture puts it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term "source of all that is" comes up a lot in these descriptions, and I am baffled about several things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How is this not just word salad?  I can make any definition I want, but that doesn't guarantee I am saying anything meaningful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When we say that something is a &lt;em&gt;source&lt;/em&gt; of something, then we should be able to specify some of its properties.  For example, if we say that the source of the large rotation speeds of galaxies is dark matter, we are saying that dark matter (whatever it is) has mass -- or at least a gravitational effect -- and we can quantify the effect, the cases where we see the source and where we don't, we can rule out some of the things that dark matter isn't, etc...  What properties does this Alpha and Omega have?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why call it "God"?  That word has a lot of baggage, and is commonly (and historically) used to refer to an &lt;em&gt;agent&lt;/em&gt; which answers prayers, produces miraculous events (both modern and historical), and fine-tunes universal constants.  If "source of all that is" is a different thing than this, then use a different word or you run the risk of equivocation.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why think the "Alpha and Omega" is a mind at all?  Why not just some brute property of the universe, like the laws of logic or abstract numbers?  How could you tell?  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can you possibly get from this nebulous "source of all that is" to the stories in a religious text?  If the "serious theist" wants to say that some of those stories and claims in those texts are actually true, then they become testable (and have failed as far as I can tell).  If  the "serious theist" wants to say that these stories are just metaphors, then the texts hold the same content as Harry Potter books -- nice stories that might give some life lessons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I come back to the idea that if this "source of all that is" has any discernible impact on our lives, then it is measurable and thus testable empirically.  If not, then it has no use and is indistinguishable from nothing.  The "serious theist" can state all they want that "the existence of God is not an empirical question" but all they are saying is that their claims are just empty words.  &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="religion"></category><category term="religion"></category><category term="philosophy"></category></entry><entry><title>Why undesigned coincidences are not compelling to me</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2022/Jul/11/why-undesigned-coincidences-are-not-compelling-to-me/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-07-11T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2022-07-11T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2022-07-11:/posts/2022/Jul/11/why-undesigned-coincidences-are-not-compelling-to-me/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;An "undesigned coincidence" is used in an argument for the reliability of the Gospels, notable by Jonathan McLatchie, Tim McGrew and Lydia McGrew, and &lt;a href="https://jonathanmclatchie.com/yes-richard-carrier-there-are-undesigned-coincidences-part-1/"&gt;is defined as&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you have …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;An "undesigned coincidence" is used in an argument for the reliability of the Gospels, notable by Jonathan McLatchie, Tim McGrew and Lydia McGrew, and &lt;a href="https://jonathanmclatchie.com/yes-richard-carrier-there-are-undesigned-coincidences-part-1/"&gt;is defined as&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have multiple (at least two) accounts that report an event where one account answers in passing a natural question raised incidentally by the other.  Such features are &lt;em&gt;evidence&lt;/em&gt; that a real event lies behind the reports found in the gospels — that is to say, the presence of an undesigned coincidence is more probable given the hypothesis of historicism than given the annulment of that hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I am exploring an "undesigned coincidence" &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/8BQDcl7nOX8?t=2880"&gt;as described by Lydia McGrew&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the grass being green mentioned in Mark at the time, and it's Passover time mentioned in John, and each of these is mentioned only in one Gospel.  This fits together because the grass would be green around that time in Galilee.  So an ur-source theory would be that there would be one source, not reality, that mentioned both that the grass was green and that it was Passover time.  And that John just put down part of that and Mark just put down part of that, but it all came from this sort-of thing which was some version of the story that had both details in it.  What Jonathan means about simplicity is basically what you've done is taken a hypothetical source and given it the properties of reality, and put it up there instead of reality and you have space between that and the alleged hypothetical source and reality where it could be false -- the source might or might not be telling the truth.  Whereas if we just  attribute these characteristics -- the grass and the time of year -- to reality it is simpler than attributing them to this lost documentary source.  And then as he was also pointing out we have apparent discrepancies between the different accounts of the feeding of the 5000 which doesn't fit at all well with the idea of a lost source that by-jove looks like reality and people just took different parts of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tracking this description &lt;a href="https://christian-apologist.com/2022/07/02/undesigned-coincidences-in-the-feeding-of-the-5000/"&gt;a little bit more&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Mark 6:30-43, we learn that the crowd sat down on “green” grass and in John, we learn there was “much grass.” In John 6:1-14, we learn the event took place when the Passover was at hand.
The green grass corroborates the timing because the event likely took place during Israel’s rainy season, which runs from October through April. During the Passover in April, the grass would be abundant and green as it had been raining for months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The argument seems to be that because Mark mentions green grass (which doesn't add to the plot of the story) and John mentions Passover and some grass, that the best explanation of this overlap is that the miraculous event of the feeding of the 5000 actually happened.  Further that an "ur-source" which has both green grass and Passover is less likely, because we then have to posit the existence of a text or oral tradition that we don't have direct access to.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am always supremely underwhelmed with these so-called coincidences, every time I've been presented with them -- they really do seem strained.  For example, here are a few possibilities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both the authors of Mark and John were there, noted the grass and Passover, and wrote their accounts from the shared experience (McGrew's theory)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There was a text or oral story which mentions both the green grass and the Passover&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There was a story (oral or written) that just had Passover, and no grass, and through the process of oral tradition people added the grass (green or unstated) to make the story a bit more interesting.  Note that this would be really easy, even if the event was an entire fiction, because those would know that Passover was typically green so adding that flourish would be natural.  It's like adding snow to a Christmas story (in the US at least) even if the original story doesn't mention snow.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There was a story where there was grass (no color given) and that it was Passover, and Mark adds the color as a literary flourish and doesn't mention the time because it was not important for that story&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There was a story about sitting on the green grass, and John (or his source) adds the particular festival for theological reasons, that Mark didn't seem to have.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The McGrews seem to think that the "ur-source" is positing a specific text that exists, rather than a process which produces texts.  It is not the simplest idea to say that the events happened as stated, when we have other reasons to doubt them (e.g. miracles are unlikely) when we also have many known processes which could produce them, both with and without a separate text or oral tradition.  I could probably envision several other possibilities for this "coincidence", but the point seems to be,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We don't know the authors of any of the Gospels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We don't know the details of the process by which they got their information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We &lt;em&gt;do know&lt;/em&gt; that several of them had copies of at least some of the direct texts, in addition to who-knows how many other sources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We &lt;em&gt;do know&lt;/em&gt; that there is strong indication that some of the Gospel writing was included for &lt;em&gt;theological&lt;/em&gt;  or &lt;em&gt;literary&lt;/em&gt; reasons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The actual posited coincidences are pretty weak. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last point needs a bit of unpacking.  The rainy season is stated to go from October through April, which is more than half the year.  If you included a story that had green grass, you'd be correct about the "time of year" more than 50% of the time.  John, in his story, doesn't seem to mention Passover directly.  In John 2:13 he mentions "When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover" and then between that and the grass incident, we have phrases like (emphasis mine) John 3:22 "where he spent &lt;strong&gt;some time&lt;/strong&gt; with them".  Then John 5:1 "&lt;strong&gt;Some time later&lt;/strong&gt;, Jesus went up to Jerusalem for one of the Jewish festivals." then John 6:1 we have "&lt;strong&gt;Some time after this&lt;/strong&gt;," before the feeding.  So, for the McGrews if the "undesigned coincidence" works in their favor, they can say there is an overlap.   If it didn't, then it probably wouldn't be noticed.  But even if noticed, it can be plausibly denied given the lack of specificity in the time on both sides of the story.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone who is convinced by these two passages as an "undesigned coincidence" I would be skeptical of many of their claims.  I don't have time nor the expertise to go through each and every one of the so-called "coincidences", but they all strike me initially as being completely -- and trivially -- understood as being produced by a common process and are not strong evidence that the events actually happened.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A larger point also, is that even if there is agreement on the time of year, or even specifically a day of an event,  that doesn't mean that the events actually occurred on that day -- it only implies that the &lt;em&gt;story&lt;/em&gt; occurs on that day.  It makes sense that Passover would appear importantly in many stories, both real and fictional, so "coincidences" which tie a story to that day do not say much about whether they are true or not. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="religion"></category></entry><entry><title>Miracles are rare except when they aren't</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2022/Feb/07/miracles-are-rare-except-when-they-arent/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-02-07T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-02-07T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2022-02-07:/posts/2022/Feb/07/miracles-are-rare-except-when-they-arent/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In this week's &lt;a href="https://www.premierchristianradio.com/Shows/Saturday/Unbelievable/Episodes/Unbelievable-Send-Proof-Is-there-medical-evidence-for-miracles-Craig-Keener-Michael-Shermer-and-Elijah-Stephens"&gt;Unbelievable Podcast&lt;/a&gt; the topic was miracles.

I've &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/search.html?q=miracles"&gt;written about miracles a number of times&lt;/a&gt;, but there always seems to something new to say.  In this episode, the skeptic is Michael Shermer whose approach by and large I don't like.  I find he isn't very direct, has long explanations and stories -- which is inefficient in this format -- and many of his responses are not actually relevant.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theists presented two main specific miracle claims:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pqj2i9gb8U&amp;amp;t=1s"&gt;Bruce Van Natta&lt;/a&gt; who had a truck fall on him, destroying much of his intestine, but shortly after prayer his intestine miraculously regrew.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0QtFCpFg9I"&gt;Chris Gunderson&lt;/a&gt; who was born with an incurable disorder called Chronic Pseudo Obstruction Syndrome, which was cured by prayer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and then they referred to the Heidi Baker ministries work in Mozambique healing many.  You can read about it in the &lt;a href="https://pcpj2.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/study_of_the_therapeutic_effects_of_proximal-5.pdf"&gt;journal article here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite my attempts, I can't find medical journal descriptions of the two cases for Van Natta and Gunderson.  However, I did find the original study on the work of Heidi Baker, but I had already &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2020/Jul/09/skepticism-and-dubious-medical-procedures/"&gt;responded to that source and those claims elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;. TLDR -- the study has serious problems and is unconvincing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's another way to put it.  What would we expect in a universe that is complex, that we understand reasonably well but with significant gaps in our understanding, but that we also tend to understand better over time?  What would we expect if there really is an agent that answers some requests, and has the ability to do truly miraculous things?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's the same sort of question one asks about alien abductions.  What would we expect in a universe where the aliens aren't here, and our own understanding and tech increases in time, vs if the aliens are here from time to time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both of these cases, we'd expect the situation without external agencies to be a smattering of weird cases that remain unexplained currently, but with no obvious pattern to them.  We'd also expect that we'd get &lt;em&gt;fewer&lt;/em&gt; of these cases (normalizing to population number and rate of information spread) over time. We'd expect geographical areas that have less access to our best understanding and technology to have more of these cases.  We'd expect that the more skeptical we look at the claims, the more closely we look at the evidence, that the evidence for the claims tends to evaporate.  It is no coincidence that UFO claims have gone down as we've put a camera in everyone's pocket.  This is the hallmark of a false claim.  The same occurs with miracle claims -- they have every hallmark of a false claim. The smattering of currently unexplained miracle claims lack available evidence to inspect, show no real pattern, and are against a backdrop of claims that have been debunked.   These miracle claims are also against a backdrop of nearly universal prayer across the population, with little to no effect.  Finally, where I have been able to find the evidence, the actual strength of the evidence on the ground is profoundly weak.  In all other cases, I have not been able to even find the evidence -- only the claims.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This backdrop of failed prayer and debunked miracle claims highlight the fact that miracle &lt;em&gt;claims&lt;/em&gt; are likely to be false, lowering their prior probability.  If prayer were a new claimed medical procedure, no one would take it seriously with such a false claim and negative result rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the guests, Craig Keener, stated that Heidi's Baker's miracles were happening regularly, yet none of the guests seemed willing to address why that might not be happening in a country with the technology able to discern false from true effects?  The single study they quoted is riddled with problems, and you'd think they'd want to perform a more detailed study here.  They claimed that miracles are hard to study, because miracles are rare events and can't be predicted ahead of time, but that seems a convenient excuse -- and not always the case, if Heidi Baker is to be believed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Craig Keener also hinted that there &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; a pattern to the miracles, but didn't come out and say what he was strongly suggesting, that Christian miracles were the ones that were mostly happening.  Any pattern that Keener might have been hinting at would be testable!  It certainly would go a long way to supporting the veracity of miracle claims if you could specify a pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find myself still unconvinced by the few claims, with little pattern or evidence, but perhaps as our understanding grows we'll get more confirmed cases, as we would expect for a true effect.  My bet is that these claims will continue to be in retreat just as the UFOs seem to have left us as our ability to detect them has increased.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="religion"></category><category term="unbelievable"></category></entry><entry><title>Bad Apologetics</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2022/Jan/18/bad-apologetics/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-01-18T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-01-18T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2022-01-18:/posts/2022/Jan/18/bad-apologetics/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;Unbelievable&lt;/em&gt; podcast episode &lt;a href="https://www.premierchristianradio.com/Shows/Saturday/Unbelievable/Episodes/Unbelievable-Do-extraordinary-claims-require-extraordinary-evidence-Jonathan-McLatchie-vs-Jonathan-Pearce"&gt;Do extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence?

Jonathan McLatchie vs Jonathan Pearce&lt;/a&gt; I was struck by several claims and points, especially made by Jonathan McLatchie.   I went back and listened to two other debates with him, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/a-wIaCRIdOA"&gt;one with Matt Dillahunty&lt;/a&gt;  and &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2020/May/29/jonathan-and-brian-in-conversation/"&gt;one with myself&lt;/a&gt; and found some of the points Pearce made against McLatchie were things that both I and Matt had brought up -- mostly about McLatchie's apparent over-fondness for stories over real evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bayes-factors-and-confidence"&gt;Bayes Factors and Confidence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonathan McLatchie talks about cumulative cases, using the vocabulary of probability theory, such as,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have two pieces of evidence each with a base factor of 10 and then combined they have a cumulative base factor of 100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He thinks in terms of &lt;em&gt;independent&lt;/em&gt; data pushing the likelihoods up and down so that once you've used one data point to update the likelihoods, you can start with that updated likelihood with the next data point -- ignoring any possible dependency between one data point and another.  As we see below, it also ignores priors. This makes the process easy, but it leads to false positives which can be seen in a trivial example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in my book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2019/Jan/14/stats-for-everyone/"&gt;Statistical Inference for Everyone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, I use an example of drawing cards from a deck of (unusual) cards and trying to infer which deck.  At some point we have drawn a number of 9's (with replacement) in a row, and are trying to infer whether the deck is a so-called High deck (which has 10 10's, 9 9's, 8 8's, ... , 2 2's and 1 A ), a so-called Low deck (which has  1 10, 2 9's, ... , and 10 A's), and a so-called Nines deck (which has all 9's).  The Nines deck is a-priori a lot less probable, because we were simply told that there were two decks -- High and Low.  However, after many draws of 9 in a row that claim seems less likely.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://bblais.github.io/images/Pasted image 20220118061447.png" width=80% align=center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Bayes factors alone, the data would only support the Nines deck and miss the actual (correct) inference.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another problem with ignoring priors is that it commits you to believe many other crazy claims and would lead you to &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2010/Aug/28/the-non-psychic-octopus/"&gt;believe in psychic octopuses&lt;/a&gt;.  I made this point with McLatchie and so did Matt Dillahunty -- if you have a flawed epistemology then you will be forced to either believe in crazy things or be inconsistent and hypocritical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rarity-of-miracles-is-evidence-against-them"&gt;Rarity of Miracles is Evidence Against Them&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McLatchie states, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hypothesis that God has used miracles as authenticating signs predicts that they will stand out against the normal course of nature.  The fact that miracles do in fact stand out against nature cannot be taken as evidence against miracles because the hypothesis predicts very strongly that's what you'll find.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What McLatchie doesn't seem to see is that &lt;em&gt;regardless of the source&lt;/em&gt; any purported cause of an event which is rare &lt;em&gt;has a low prior&lt;/em&gt;, which should be used against it when comparing to other causes with higher priors.  Since God is supposedly using miracles as "authenticating signs", if you are going to interpret any particular event as a miracle you have to overcome the low prior -- "authenticating signs" would be rare -- support it with stronger evidence than would be needed for a more mundane explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would further ask McLatchie, why should authenticating signs be rare in the first place?  Why couldn't God make a miracle like his name written in the clouds every time the sun comes up, to authenticate his existence and power?  Also, would McLatchie have to be making arguments like this if God were a lot more obvious?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-prophecy-of-passover"&gt;The Prophecy of Passover&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one that really perplexes me is Jonathan's perspective on the prophecy that Jesus would be executed on Passover (or around Passover, depending on which Gospel you read).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;another example would be that jesus death coincides with the feast of passover so jesus dies [on Passover or around Passover] according to all four gospels [...] so jesus in the new testament is presented and portrayed as the fulfillment of that passover lamb that he is the ultimate passover lamb that the passover feasts pointed to and so it's quite a coincidence  it's quite fitting then that jesus death coincides with the feast of passover that's the strength [...]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are very good &lt;em&gt;story-reasons&lt;/em&gt; for having this be the case, the authors of the Gospels &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; the Old Testament stories, and could interpret the Jesus story in light of them and write the story accordingly.  This is so straightforward an explanation, with very little to counter it -- even if you believe the writers to be eye-witnesses.  All you'd need is for Jesus to be executed sometime in the vicinity of Passover, a short time of an oral tradition or retelling of the stories by the same people (which get naturally embellished) and you've got it.  McLatchie's argument is so uncompelling for anyone who isn't already convinced that it is remarkable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="undesigned-coincidences"&gt;Undesigned Coincidences&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another argument made by McLatchie is the supposed use of "undesigned coincidences" in the text.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="https://jonathanmclatchie.com/yes-richard-carrier-there-are-undesigned-coincidences-part-1/"&gt;one of his responses to Richard Carrier&lt;/a&gt;, McLatchie writes,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the most classic form (which Carrier is attempting to define) is when you have multiple (at least two) accounts that report an event where one account answers in passing a natural question raised incidentally by the other. Contrary to what Carrier asserts, the argument has never been that such features &lt;em&gt;prove&lt;/em&gt; there was a real story. Rather, such features are &lt;em&gt;evidence&lt;/em&gt; that a real event lies behind the reports found in the gospels — that is to say, the presence of an undesigned coincidence is more probable given the hypothesis of historicism than given the annulment of that hypothesis. Some undesigned coincidences contribute greater evidence than others. Carrier’s lack of nuance in his description of the basic argument does not get his article off to the best start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think my biggest problem with this line of thinking is that there are &lt;em&gt;major&lt;/em&gt; differences between the narratives in the Gospels.  For example, the nativity narratives are contradictory -- just try to map out the path Jesus' parents take.   The resurrection narratives too do not agree with each other, like the number of people coming and going, whether things were open or closed, or who actually saw Jesus.  When apologists have to make arguments (i.e. the text is not clear) to justify seeming discrepancies in large events, why should we pay attention to &lt;em&gt;subtle&lt;/em&gt; agreements?  Why should we be surprised that there are some agreements, when we know that there are literary and other source dependencies between the anonymous writings of the Gospels?  Again, McLatchie's argument is so uncompelling for anyone who isn't already convinced that it is remarkable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lack-of-priors"&gt;Lack of Priors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is striking how many recent apologists use Bayesian reasoning yet ignore the prior -- which means they really aren't using Bayesian reasoning but want to just &lt;em&gt;sound&lt;/em&gt; like they are.  This is a form of dishonesty, I feel, but at best it is a clumsy analysis -- and a problem that has been pointed out &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2021/Aug/29/bad-apologetics-ep-18-bayes-machine-goes-brrrrrrrrr/"&gt;for the McGrews&lt;/a&gt;, Calum Miller &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Jul/11/unbelievable-project-the-probability-of-the-resurrection/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/DRNIXn1xD_0"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2015/Aug/10/deduction-induction-and-abduction-oh-my/"&gt;Blake Giunta&lt;/a&gt;, and of course &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2020/May/29/jonathan-and-brian-in-conversation/"&gt;mentioned in my conversation with Jonathan McLatchie&lt;/a&gt;.    The use of Bayes Factors, which also ignores priors, is indicative of this approach. Why do apologists want to ignore priors?

Jonathan McLatchie vs Jonathan Pearce&lt;/a&gt; I was struck by several claims and points, especially made by Jonathan McLatchie.   I went back and listened to two other debates with him, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/a-wIaCRIdOA"&gt;one with Matt Dillahunty&lt;/a&gt;  and &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2020/May/29/jonathan-and-brian-in-conversation/"&gt;one with myself&lt;/a&gt; and found some of the points Pearce made against McLatchie were things that both I and Matt had brought up -- mostly about McLatchie's apparent over-fondness for stories over real evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="proton-decay-and-rare-events"&gt;Proton Decay and Rare Events&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McLatchie says that the frequency with which we experience something is not always a good guide to its probability.  Although I'd suggest that it is &lt;em&gt;usually&lt;/em&gt; a very good guide, let's look at his example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McLatchie says &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_decay"&gt;proton decay&lt;/a&gt; has not been observed, but is predicted by most (if not all) grand unified theories of particle physics so frequency is not a good guide for prior probability.   He comments that the difference between a rare event that has a low prior vs one with a high prior, like that for proton decay, is that proton decay has a &lt;em&gt;theoretical underpinning&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it's not that this is just a random guess even though there's no precedent&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, he feels, the resurrection has no  precedent but also has a theoretical underpinning.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...] frequency  isn't the most helpful metric for assessing the prior probability you also want to look for whether there's a theoretical underpinning for this hypothesis and likewise with the case for christianity the case for the resurrection in particular i think that you can make a similar case from a theoretical underpinning a background information that stands independently of the extent to which there is precedence in our experience of the miraculous [...]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comparison is laughable to me, given the differences in the "theoretical underpinning" of each, but let's see how the comparison plays out.  The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model"&gt;Standard Model&lt;/a&gt; predicts that proton decay will not happen -- that it violates a conservation law --  however many models that build off of the Standard Model do include proton decay.   Given the state of affairs, I'm not sure if scientists put a large prior on proton decay anyway, but let's grant that -- say, we are reasonably confident that proton decay will occur.  What theoretical underpinning would we have to give us this confidence?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many times that science has predicted rare and unprecedented events or effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the motion of the Earth through the Ether (e.g. Michaelson-Morely experiment)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the bending of star light by a massive object (e.g. Einsteins GR prediction)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;civilizations on Mars (e.g. Lowell's canals)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the existence of the Higgs Boson (1967 work by many scientists, including &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/510036a"&gt;one of my former instructors, Gerry Guralnik&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;proton decay (predicted by many Grand Unified theories)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that several of these were not confirmed, yet at the time there were good reasons to think they were true.  Whenever science has predicted a rare, unprecedented event there have been common patterns.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the novel theory is consistent with &lt;em&gt;every other&lt;/em&gt; confirmed prediction from the other theories.  For example General Relativity describes gravity, predicts novel phenomena, but can be shown in certain limits to be consistent with Newton's Law of Gravity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the novel theory predicts &lt;em&gt;specific limits&lt;/em&gt; on the novel phenomena.  For example, General Relativity predicts the exact angle that starlight will bend passing by the known mass of the Sun, and specifically how accurately the measurements need to be made.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ones confidence in a novel theory's prediction, before the prediction is confirmed, comes down to how &lt;em&gt;much the other predictions of the novel theory have been confirmed&lt;/em&gt; -- especially if the theory has made several striking confirmed predictions.  For example, scientists were confident in the existence of gravity waves for a long time before they were observed, because General Relativity had passed every test to an accuracy as good as we could measure, and many of those tests were profoundly unintuitive and unexpected.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can be confident in the prediction of proton decay in as much as those theories that predict it have been confirmed to a great degree on other terms.  For example, &lt;a href="https://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/PT.3.2223"&gt;"the standard model predicts the electron magnetic moment to an astonishing accuracy of one part in a trillion."&lt;/a&gt;  The Standard Model is also consistent with every other theory within its domain, and doesn't violate any outside of its domain (the role of gravity, for example, is outside the Standard Model).  Grand unified theories all have to be as accurate as the Standard Model to be considered.  It is these factors that make us confident in the prediction of novel phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does the "theoretical underpinning" of the God-theory for the Resurrection stack up?  The things that McLatchie brings up are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keener's book of Miracles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is merit to Lewis trilemma (i.e. Liar, Lunatic, Lord)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;multi-sensory experiences, with groups, around the Resurrection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;prophecy such as Christianity becoming a global religion, predicted in the Old Testament&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus executed on/around passover, predicted in the Old Testament&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The episode dealt with these topics pretty well, and I've written a bit about some of them, including &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/May/21/a-little-about-miracles/"&gt;miracles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Mar/18/unbelievable-project-miracles-and-healing-is-it-evidence-for-the-truth-of-christianity/"&gt;healings&lt;/a&gt;,  and &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2020/May/29/jonathan-and-brian-in-conversation/"&gt;my conversation with Jonathan McLatchie&lt;/a&gt;.  But simply compare the theories around proton decay and those of the Resurrection.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one is consistent with &lt;em&gt;every other&lt;/em&gt; confirmed prediction from the other theories -- the other isn't.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one predicts &lt;em&gt;specific limits&lt;/em&gt; on the novel phenomena, including time frames and what &lt;em&gt;specific&lt;/em&gt; steps we'd need to confirm it  -- the other doesn't.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one has a pile of other novel &lt;em&gt;specific&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;quantitative&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;predictions&lt;/strong&gt; that have since been confirmed -- the other doesn't.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I want to ask Jonathan McLatchie a few questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you make a &lt;strong&gt;prediction&lt;/strong&gt; of when miraculous healing, or any other miracles, will happen -- or is it always post-hoc?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you make any description of a measurement that could be done, no matter how impractical, for directly confirming any of the &lt;strong&gt;predictions&lt;/strong&gt; from the God-theory?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You mentioned a case of a healing of Irene McDonald with multiple sclerosis, but I can't find the medical details (i.e. the actual doctor's reports, the detailed timeline, etc...).  Same with the case of Barbara Schnyder.  Can you provide those? (note -- some of your other medical miracle claims were &lt;a href="http://localhost:8000/posts/2020/Jul/09/skepticism-and-dubious-medical-procedures/"&gt;suspect after I researched them&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How did you determine that these people were healed &lt;em&gt;by prayer&lt;/em&gt; and also &lt;em&gt;by God&lt;/em&gt;?  You can't answer "because they prayed and she was healed after" (post-hoc fallacy) and you can't answer "because they prayed to the Christian God", because some other God may have answered, or some other thing.  You have to, in your explanation, be able to distinguish from the prayers that haven't worked, the cases where healing happened without prayer or with prayer to another God.  Without this, you can't make a reasonable claim that God-did-it.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methodological naturalism&lt;/em&gt; is the only choice we have available, because no one has demonstrated any procedure to distinguish supernatural claims. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To assume a naturalistic explanation in the future is simply the recognition that in &lt;em&gt;every single case&lt;/em&gt; where we have finally understood a topic, the best explanation has &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; turned out to be supernatural...&lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://disqus.com/by/r_morales/"&gt;R Morales&lt;/a&gt; replies that my response is a &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"bit like someone using a metal detector to [...] look for valuable natural resources such as gold, silver or gems, only finding valuable metals, and then concluding that therefore it is unlikely that there are nonmetal valuable resources in that mine, "&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've heard this analogy before, and I think it is worth responding to because on the face it does seem reasonable.  The second you restrict the target of a search, then it shouldn't be surprising that you don't find certain things, right?  As with all analogies, one has to make sure that the relevant components are considered.  Let me see if I can use the metal detector analogy to convey my original statement better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're on a beach, and other than sand, there are objects we might discover buried there. I note that there are some metal objects, and build a metal detector.  At first my metal detector is not terrific -- it can only find large objects -- but I keep improving it over the years to find smaller and smaller objects.  Now, my friend says that he sees plastic objects that I can't detect with my detector.  "Yay!" I say, and ask him for his plastic detector.  He doesn't have one.  He has provided no way to detect plastic, but says that he can see it.  "See that lump over there, it's hiding a plastic object".  I go over with my metal detector, and find that the lump is caused by a metal object.  He keeps doing this, pointing this way and that, and I keep detecting metal, and he continues to provide no method for detecting plastic despite his claims.  Further, every claim of a plastic object turns out to be metal.  Sometimes it takes a while -- the object is made of some unknown material, my friend insists it's plastic, and it turns out to be metal anyway.   This goes on for years and years.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if someone on the beach produces some unknown object, what are the chances that it is plastic?  How would you know?  If you were forced to bet, what bet would you do -- metal or plastic?  &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="religion"></category></entry><entry><title>Skepticism and Dubious Medical Procedures</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2020/Jul/09/skepticism-and-dubious-medical-procedures/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-07-09T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-07-09T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2020-07-09:/posts/2020/Jul/09/skepticism-and-dubious-medical-procedures/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In my discussion with Jonathan McLatchie on the Still Unbelievable podcast, I said that there hasn’t been a verified miracle claim even since Hume’s essay on miracles.

Jonathan then told me two: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Case report of instantaneous resolution of juvenile macular degeneration blindness after proximal intercessory prayer”, Clarissa Romez, Kenn Freedman, David Zaritzky, Joshua W. Brown. &lt;em&gt;Explore&lt;/em&gt;. Available online 28 February 2020 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550830720300926&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Case Report of gastroparesis healing: 16 years of a chronic syndrome resolved after proximal intercessory prayer”,Clarissa Romeza, David Zaritzky, Joshua W. Brown. &lt;em&gt;Complementary Therapies in Medicine&lt;/em&gt;. Volume 43, April 2019, Pages 289-294.  https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965229918313116 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when I looked at this, I kept finding those two and a third, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Study of the Therapeutic Effects of Proximal Intercessory Prayer (STEPP) on Auditory and Visual Impairments in Rural Mozambique”, Candy Gunther Brown, Stephen C Mory, Rebecca Williams, Michael J McClymond.  &lt;em&gt;South Med J&lt;/em&gt;. 2010 Sep;103(9):864-9 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20686441/&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These three kept popping up again and again.  The journals have dubious standards, and the authors work for the same institution (https://www.globalmri.org/about).  On their website there is the following request: “We’re always looking for new testimonies. Do you have a testimony that is medically verified?”.  Could you imagine a similar claim written about, say, a homeopathic remedy for cancer?  If you took our remedy, and improved, we want to hear from you.  Otherwise, not.  Regardless of the contents of the specific studies, this sort of fishing for positive results is thoroughly unscientific and casts significant doubt on any results from this institution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My suspicions were confirmed going to http://sciencebasedmedicine.org (a great resource) where they have an article about the 3rd study in the list above:  https://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/proximal-intercessory-prayer/  Bottom line, this study has numerous, basic scientific problems with it and the results cannot be trusted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find that argument that a deity is better able to heal when the person asking them to do so is physically close to the person they are praying for absurd, lame, and convenient. It is a nice excuse to unblind the protocol, and nothing else –  a way of generating false-positive results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the process for collecting subjects used by these authors and supported by their institution,  in addition to their experimental design, is constructed with the sole purpose of bypassing the methods of science.  I was particularly surprised when I dug into the first study, went into their supplemental information, and saw a nice timeline of events (&lt;strong&gt;emphasis mine&lt;/strong&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[…]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;June 14 1960  Complete Neurological Examination Completely normal except for macular degeneration “cause undetermined”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1971 Examination confirms “ legal blindness” Recording of Visual Acuities - are consistent with legal blindness. No glasses recommended.  Degeneration and scaring (sic) of macula in both eyes &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1971-1974 Record of a series of Visual Acuities Visual Acuities consistent with legal blindness until record of 1974  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1/29/71  Visual Acuity  Right Eye- Finger Count  Left Eye - Hand motion- All without glasses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1-18-72  Right Eye - Hand Motion,  Left Eye - Hand Motion &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6-14-74 Right Eye - 20/100-1 Left Eye - 20/100-2  All (above) without glasses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1972 Learned to use a cane and read braille.  Blind Services: orientation and mobility skills and braille reading  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;02/18/1972-05/18/1972: Patient reports going through a Training Center to learn to walk with a cane and read braille. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**1972   August Vision restored through PIP **&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 4, 2001 Complete Eye Examination&lt;/strong&gt; VA 20/40 OD, 20/40-2 OS Corrected VA 20/40 OU None recorded Visual Acuity 20/40, 20/40-2.  Glasses -0.25 OD, -0.50 OS Normal eye exam except for evidence of dry eye early cataract changes. Optic nerves and maculae recorded as normal but also states + RPE dropout in macula OU.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;October 16, 2001  Return Visit. Treatment for Dry Eyes Provided&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;October 3, 2012.  Cataract surgery of right eye&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Etc…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the time between the prayer and the eye exam is…29 years!  This is “instantaneous resolution”?  Essentially, we’re taking this patient's word that their eyesight improved after prayer, but the authors (or anyone else) didn’t bother to test it for nearly 30 years.  This level of incompetence, poor design, and digging for positive results is staggering.  This is not the way one confirms medical claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second study seems at least a bit better, but with no controls, and knowing that the authors have a history of ludicrously bad design leaves me unconvinced.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I have tried to convey here is the process for investigating claims.  You look at the originals, you examine methods and possible ways the authors could have (deliberately or not) biased the results.  This is why we have blinding processes for medical experiments, and controls.  Otherwise you can always fall victim to false positives and rare one-off events.  We know that medical conditions can mysteriously improve (biology is complex and not entirely understood), so if you want to show your method of treatment actually works you do need to follow reasonable, skeptical procedures established by science.  It's certainly hard to do this, takes more time and work, but there is good reason why we trust science.  The lazy procedures of these authors -- including a self-proclaimed fishing for positive results -- is at best a cop-out and at worst a dishonest attempt to peddle bogus treatments.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="religion"></category></entry><entry><title>Book Review - "Unbelievable?" by Justin Brierley</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2019/Feb/11/book-review-unbelievable-by-justin-brierley/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-02-11T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-02-11T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2019-02-11:/posts/2019/Feb/11/book-review-unbelievable-by-justin-brierley/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2 id="structure-of-the-review"&gt;Structure of the Review&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I finished this review it became apparent that there are two main audiences for what I wrote - those that have yet to read the book and those that have already read the book.  Therefore I decided to break the review up into two parts, one for each audience.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="for-those-that-have-not-yet-read-unbelievable"&gt;For those that have &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; yet read &lt;em&gt;Unbelievable?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id="context"&gt;Context&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been listening to &lt;a href="https://www.premierchristianradio.com/Shows/Saturday/Unbelievable"&gt;this podcast&lt;/a&gt; for years and even had a &lt;a href="http://bblais.github.io/search.html?q=unbelievable"&gt;project several years ago&lt;/a&gt; with the lofty goal of responding to each and every episode.  I did not achieve the goal, unfortunately.  The problem was two-fold:
1. There are too many episodes
2. Nearly every episode is so packed with interesting content that my responses were taking longer than a week to prepare, so I was always behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The podcast is a model of how discussions can go, even when the topic is contentious.  Justin Brierley is the epitome of civil.  Like a good moderator, it isn't always clear where he stands on the issue - it's even easy to ignore the fact that he's a believer himself!  He does an amazing job in the podcast of rephrasing what even his opponents state - skillfully  &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man#Steelmanning"&gt;steelmanning&lt;/a&gt; the entire time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book, &lt;a href="https://www.premierchristianradio.com/Shows/Saturday/Unbelievable/Unbelievable-the-Book"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unbelievable? Why After Ten Years of Talking with Atheists I'm Still a Christian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has all the best of the podcast in book form.  It's a plea for a return to civil discourse on hard topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Having conversations as one of the most important things we do in life“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Many conversation descend into the equivalent of verbal hand grenades being lobbed over the barricades of our carefully erected worldviews.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brierley demonstrates how you can respect a position that you disagree with and how you can -- without fear -- present someone else's argument even better than they can.  I can't help but think that this book was aptly timed for this age of quick sound-bites and tweets.  We live in a culture where it seems to be acceptable to malign your opponent without addressing their concerns or characterize their positions in such uncharitable ways that everyone speaks past each other.  It is a ray of light that this book - despite the fact that I disagree strongly with its conclusions - reaches across the aisle gently and respectfully with an invitation to engage in the discussion openly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is for this reason, out of respect, that I take a thoughtful, thorough approach to this review.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="structure-of-the-book"&gt;Structure of the Book&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the first chapter on &lt;em&gt;"Creating Better Conversations,"&lt;/em&gt; the book's chapters walk the reader through all of the standard arguments for God and Christianity, sprinkled with anecdotes from Brierley's interviews.  The book reads very nicely and has a conversational tone, introducing the reader to some of Brierley's original reasons for believing - from personal experience and revelation - and many other reasons to support which belief that he admits came later along.  The book is remarkably complete and as far as I can tell, hits all the major apologetics' points - including some arguments that have been circulating in the Christian community literally for thousands of years.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brierley explains the Cosmological Arguments and the Fine Tuning Arguments in the chapter &lt;em&gt;"God Makes Sense of Human Existence."&lt;/em&gt;  The Moral Arguments, likewise, are addressed in the chapter &lt;em&gt;"God Makes Sense of Human Value."&lt;/em&gt;  He continues with arguments from purpose, the existence of Jesus, the evidence for the Resurrection, and suffering. Brierley finishes the book with a pragmatic explanation of living in the "Christian Story" and the benefits of choosing to live in that way.  For anyone not familiar with the standard arguments for Christianity, &lt;em&gt;Unbelievable?&lt;/em&gt; is a great introduction and summary of the primary arguments.  For anyone who cares about civil and intelligent dialog, this book is for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="for-those-that-have-read-unbelievable"&gt;For those that have read &lt;em&gt;Unbelievable?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I am not convinced by these arguments and Brierley is where is the divide?  I will hopefully address this question in the rest of this review.  I break each of my responses into the appropriate topics, essentially following the order of the book, discussing where I disagree with Brierley's conclusions at many places.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must admit that most of the chapters present so much of &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; sides of the arguments that the book is unusually balanced for its genre.  It also means that this review is quite a bit longer than I would do for other books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="personal-experience"&gt;Personal Experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Brierley, by his own admission, personal experience is the primary reason for his &lt;em&gt;original&lt;/em&gt; conversion.  He refers to a personal experience in a youth retreat in 1995, calling it a “moment of surrender“ where God "showed up," noting that most if not all Christians would probably relate to this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I suspect that something similar is true for most people who call themselves Christians.  It's not that they can necessarily pinpoint a 'moment of surrender' like mine, but their faith is nevertheless grounded in an experience of God's presence in their lives, perhaps in some emotionally tangible way, or simply as a deep-down 'knowing' that has been there as long as they can remember." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've never had such an experience, at least not tangibly, so I can't address Brierley's experience directly.  However, we have learned from science that personal experience that isn't accessible to others doesn't typically track reality - it tracks subjectivity.  People have profound experiences quite often and then interpret these experiences in all sorts of ways.  This does not mean that those interpretations are correct, even if the experiences themselves are real.  It is only through an honest exploration of the possible explanations, through prediction and skepticism, that we can achieve something close to the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think Brierley would disagree with this - which is why he goes to great pains to explore the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="second-law-of-thermodynamics"&gt;Second Law of Thermodynamics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My dad also said something else. As a scientist he found it intriguing that the emergence of life on our planet seems to disobey one of the fundamental laws of nature. The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that, when left to their own devices, all closed systems (such as our universe), will move towards increasing 'entropy' -- the scientific word for disorder.“ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every physicist will tell you why this is an incorrect statement - because the earth is not a closed system.  Under the logic of this quote, even something like frozen ice would not be produced on the earth because it is a lower entropy state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've had a bad experience with this particular argument in University.  The correction to the argument is both easy to find.  Further, unlike other such arguments, you won't find any disagreement with any physicist you ask.  It is the fact that the answer is so easy to find and consistent with the experts that there really is no excuse left to keep using this argument.  Even so, I have seen Christians use it &lt;em&gt;even after being corrected&lt;/em&gt;.  The claim is so outlandish, from a physical point of view, that if a scientist actually believed it, they would have to admit that a frozen pond (also a decrease in entropy) would be impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The claim presented in this quote represents a pervasive lack of imagination on the part of the theist where they seemingly can't wrap their brains around the idea that complexity can arise from natural processes.  This lack of imagination infects not just this argument, but the fine tuning argument, other arguments from design, and even the moral argument. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fine-tuning"&gt;Fine Tuning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sean Carroll, an outspoken cosmologist from CalTech, says that &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qKZqPy9T8&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=2305"&gt;the Fine Tuning Argument is the "theist's best argument"&lt;/a&gt; and it is well communicated in "&lt;em&gt;Unbelievable?&lt;/em&gt;."  The problem is that, despite the confident claims of many theists, the physicists are not at all clear how much fine tuning there is or if there is any at all.  The way fine tuning is demonstrated starts with noticing that there are some &lt;em&gt;seemingly arbitrary&lt;/em&gt; constants in our physical laws (e.g. speed of light, expansion rate of the universe, etc...).  These constants if &lt;em&gt;varied independently&lt;/em&gt; lead to conditions where life &lt;em&gt;as we know it&lt;/em&gt;  couldn't form.  The emphasis here is to point out the problems with making confident claims about these observations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the constants may be determined by other laws we don't know right now.  This has happened already for the expansion rate of the universe, which can be specifically derived from Einstein's equations - and shown to not be fine-tuned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the constants may not be independent, so changing one may necessitate changing another by a specific amount negating the effect&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we don't understand the conditions &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; for life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these objections, it seems premature to make any strong statements about fine tuning even if you are convinced it is there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="something-out-of-nothing"&gt;Something out of nothing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is telling, I think, that the primary scientific arguments for God rely on the fringes of the known science into the unknown.  William Lane Craig makes a great deal out of the absurd notion of something "popping into existence" from nothing - and to allow even one instance of it would allow things like bicycles to appear out of nothing.  However, he doesn't address Sean Carroll directly who shows that models of the origin of the universe have some things able to appear out of nothing and other things not.  These models actually make &lt;em&gt;predictions&lt;/em&gt; for things we may observe, e.g. correlations in the microwave background, values of the early universe entropy, etc...  What &lt;em&gt;predictions&lt;/em&gt; do the theistic models actually make about the properties of the observable universe?  None to my knowledge.  It is clear that science and religion are playing by different rules here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="contingent-vs-necessary"&gt;Contingent vs Necessary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brierley comments about the argument from contingency, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I've been struck by the obvious yet remarkable fact that there is &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; at all. [...]  Like Leibniz, I can see that it's perfectly logically possible that there could have been nothing at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not a philosopher and am unconvinced by words like &lt;em&gt;contingent&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt;.  For example, I do not see any support for the claim that there are &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; objects, or that a &lt;em&gt;being&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;mind&lt;/em&gt; could satify the requirements to be &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt;.  Maybe the only things that can be &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; are things like laws of logic, and that objects don't fit that criterion.  I don't know!  But until these are actually &lt;em&gt;demonstrated&lt;/em&gt; and not just &lt;em&gt;asserted&lt;/em&gt;, all of the arguments based on them have no content.  In the same way, perhaps the concept of "&lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt;" isn't well defined and can't manifest in reality, so the question "why is there something rather than nothing" is answered simply with "because 'nothing' isn't realizable".  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s nothing about our universe to suggest that it had to exist rather its existence is contingent. It needs an explanation of his existence.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would add as an analogy that there’s nothing about our experience on the Earth to suggest that the Earth is round or that it orbits the sun.  It may be &lt;em&gt;logically&lt;/em&gt; possible to have a flat planet, but not &lt;em&gt;physically&lt;/em&gt; realizable in our universe (note: the spherical nature of planets is due to the spherical form of the law of gravitation).  Our intuitions do not always track the truth, and truth should be our goal.  As a scientist, I am accustomed to cases of seemingly obvious things being false, and of seemingly impossible things being true irrespective of our intuitions.  Thus, strictly &lt;em&gt;philosophical arguments&lt;/em&gt; are not enough to demonstrate the existence of something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="language-of-the-universe"&gt;Language of the Universe&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is the universe written in the language of mathematics? Brierley says,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who want to ask `Why?', atheism's only answer seems to be that it is a massive coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t see it as a coincidence I see it as a requirement. In &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; universe that has any patterns at all such that life could possibly exist - no matter what form of life - then those living beings would discover those patterns as the "mathematics" of that universe.  It doesn't surprise me that there are patterns in the universe, but I still agree with Brierley that it is an amazing thing that the universe exists at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"So does science provide iron-clad proof for God's existence? No.  Could the scientific consensus change in the future?  Of course it could.  Is this all there is to say on the subject?  Certainly not.  The case for God is a cumulative one that reaches well beyond science..."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I can quibble about the use of "proof" here (science doesn't deal in proof, only evidence) I'd rather take the time to extend the notion of "science" to include things like history as well as the study of morality, which moves into the next chapters.  Really, what I am thinking is that rational discourse combined with skeptical attitudes are the components that include science and these other topics.  In the case of the universe existing, perhaps an "I don't know" is the best answer we have right now, until someone is imaginative enough to find a way to determine it.  To posit the answer "I know, and it is God" requires a level of explanation and prediction far above what any theist seems able to give.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="moral-argument"&gt;Moral argument&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In discussing human value, Brierley writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It was grim stuff, admittedly, but it was a moment which exposed the problem for atheists who affirm the subjective nature of morality but then find themselves in a bind when it comes to truly horrendous acts.  They don't just feel wrong.  They &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; wrong.  Period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He concludes the chapter with,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I have tried to persuade you of two things in this chapter.  First, that humans have a real inherent worth and dignity that transcends a purely evolutionary story of how morality came to be.  Second, if humans have such a value then it only makes sense if there is someone beyond nature who can assign them such value, the God who created them in his own image.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not generally swayed by the moral argument for a few reasons.  First, I think that much is made out the subjective/objective dichotomy that someone like Sam Harris already handles consistently.  In &lt;em&gt;The Moral Landscape&lt;/em&gt;, he is able to define morality as the concern for the suffering and well-being of conscious creatures which, even if done imperfectly, coincides well with all of the sorts of problems we associate with moral choices.  In this way, he describes an &lt;em&gt;objective&lt;/em&gt; basis for morality without resorting to outside agency.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My second issue is that the supposed solution - "God did it" - fails the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthyphro_dilemma"&gt;"Euthyphro dilemma"&lt;/a&gt; - the question whether something is good because God wills it or whether God wills it because it is good.  In the former, we get the repugnant conclusion that if God commands murder it is necessarily good (the good of a dictator).  In the latter, the good transcends God so we don't need God for the existence of the good.  The only way out of this dilemma that I have ever heard is the claim that "the standard of the Good is God’s very nature" (William Lane Craig) or something similar.  This seems to me to be word games to define your way out of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My final issue with the moral argument is that it seems to me that, like the argument from personal revelation, the argument itself relies on the &lt;em&gt;intuitive&lt;/em&gt; notion that there are some things that are &lt;em&gt;objectively&lt;/em&gt; wrong: things like murder and rape are objectively wrong, to deny this seems abhorrent, and everyone has this intuition.  Since, in other contexts (e.g. flat unmoving Earth), we have already seen that our intuitions fail in many situations, is it possible that it is failing here and we just don't see it?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore this line of thinking, one should notice that in the moral argument the usual extremes are always trotted out - murder and rape - and not something a bit more ambiguous. Since this argument holds a lot of emotional weight, perhaps we can explore this in a different way, and leave ourselves at least agnostic on this issue.  We have here some models of the source of morality - and I am neither promoting or denying any of these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Model 1: an external agent has imprinted some specific objective standards on everyone (perhaps imperfectly, like the sense of sight is imperfect). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Model 2: a naturalistic process is responsible for the &lt;em&gt;perceived&lt;/em&gt; standard through evolution. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Model 3: a naturalistic process is responsible for the standard (perceived or real) based on suffering/well being. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be others, but let's stick to these for a second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, all three models explain the &lt;em&gt;perception&lt;/em&gt; that murder and rape are objectively wrong. It would seem obvious from an evolutionary perspective that for social creatures, murder and rape would &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; objectively wrong. These three models all predict that we would have some divergence on more subtle issues, although I think not to the same degree. Model 1 would further imply that even on these more subtle aspects of morality there should eventually be convergence - the moral status of same-sex couples, for example. Models 2 and 3 would imply that there would be huge cultural differences between groups on the more subtle questions. Given our observations, this would seem to be evidence against Model 1 and the moral argument for God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In either case, if you have Models 1-3, a scientist would require further predictions that would help us actually distinguish between an agent-imparted standard and one without, even when both are consistent with our intuition about the extreme moral questions.  To say more would be presuming what the data would be without actually testing it.  We land, then, at least on the side of unconvinced but perhaps hopeful for the moral argument. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="human-purpose"&gt;Human purpose&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You and your beliefs are the product of a long chain of inevitable physical events. [...] It's all just a series of physical events - billiard balls bouncing off one another.  They aren't the least bit interested in the truth or falsity of the thoughts they are producing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the self-defeating nature of the naturalist worldview was a penny-dropping moment for me.  It meant that seeking meaning of any sort was a self-defeating enterprise for a thoroughgoing atheist.    Just as the collisions of the balls on the billiard-table only mean anything if there is a player who intended them to find a pocket, so we must be more than the matter that makes up our brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here again, I think Brierley is failing from a lack of imagination.  Meaning is a structure we attribute to actions and events in our lives. It seems to follow naturally from our pattern-seeking tendencies combined with our goals to increase well-being.  I find nothing too problematic with this view, even if we don't currently understand the detailed nature of consciousness.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a downside to notice for the "meaning from God" perspective, and that is the fact that the notion of eternal life in heaven makes &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; life not have any meaning, due to its finiteness.  Even if this life is supposedly a test for admission, the fact that the current life is &lt;em&gt;finite&lt;/em&gt; compared to the &lt;em&gt;infinite&lt;/em&gt; afterlife is enough to rob it of any significant meaning.  Clearly there are arguments on each side for this, but I just wanted to point out that it isn't completely clear even on the theistic perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="historical-arguments"&gt;Historical arguments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brierley nicely summarizes the historical arguments, both in the establishment of the existence of Jesus and the arguments of the Resurrection.  My largest concern with these arguments is the amount of trust that is placed in historical methods.  When confronted with the idea that we can't know the details of historical events to the level of repeatable, physical experiments, most people don't seem to take issue.  However, the claim that someone rose from the dead is something that - in a modern context - we'd want medical records, corroborating physical evidence, and we'd still be pretty skeptical that someone was putting us on.  Placing these events two thousand years ago, written decades after the events, by largely anonymous sources should make us &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; confident in the claim, not more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;minimal facts&lt;/em&gt; approach to the historicity of the Resurrection seems to be a major selling point for Christian apologists.  Although not a historian myself, I have read enough to see that this approach seems to never be used for any other historical event - why the special case?  I have personally found that &lt;a href="https://celsus.blog/2013/06/29/knocking-out-the-pillars-of-the-minimal-facts-apologetic/"&gt;the response by Matthew Ferguson&lt;/a&gt; - who is a historian - is as complete a response that one will ever find, and haven't seen anything even remotely convincing as a reply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-atheists-greatest-objection-suffering"&gt;The Atheist's Greatest Objection - Suffering&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll start my response here to point out that the argument from suffering is not the atheist's greatest objection.  &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRB0TDq8tWE"&gt;Like Matt Dillahunty&lt;/a&gt;, in my opinion the greatest objection to the theistic claim of the existence of God is from &lt;em&gt;hiddenness&lt;/em&gt;.  True to Brierley's form, he grapples well with all sides of the issue of suffering, bringing in all of the typical theistic counter arguments - but they are all indirect.  He implores us to appreciate how the preponderance of the other arguments for God "tips the scale towards belief in God."  He puts forward the idea that the objection is baseless because of the lack of objective morality under the atheist worldview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"it's  difficult to see how the reality of a world of moral right and wrong can exist in the absence of God. But the question being asked by the atheist is a fundamentally moral one."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He appeals to mystery,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"it is a mystery we believe will be answered in a day of final justice and joy when Jesus Christ sets the world to right."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and free will, hidden purpose of suffering, and an allegory.  Books have been written on this problem, and this chapter summarizes the topic nicely.  I am not moved by it because it feels to me - like all treatments of this topic - one excuse after another with nothing to pin it down.  As Sam Harris says, one can always answer the question "is suffering and evil consistent with God?" with a "yes" - the better question to ask is, "does the suffering we observe in the world &lt;em&gt;suggest&lt;/em&gt; there is an all-knowing, benevolent God?"  To that, the answer is clearly "no".  Sure!  You can always come up with reasons for the former, but the later is much clearer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hiddenness"&gt;Hiddenness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The really big objection, in my view, is hiddenness - the lack of obvious indicators of a divine presence.  If God actually wants a &lt;em&gt;relationship&lt;/em&gt; with people then God's lack of obvious existence is completely inconsistent with that, in a way that appealing to free will, the purpose of relationship, allegory and mystery just don't work.  If you look at nearly every one of my responses, it really comes down to not being convinced due to the lack of unambiguous evidence.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusions"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could go on with this review, but it is long enough as it is.  I applaud Brierley's efforts in summarizing 10 years of conversations on this topic.  I totally endorse his goal of improving conversation on difficult topics; and his tone in this book and the podcast should be a model for everyone.  Perhaps Brierley's book is just one more data point of confirmation bias, and perhaps my review is also.  How do we get past that?  The best way is to have the conversations, honestly and completely, and to constantly question your own perspective.  I want to thank Brierley for his fine work and hope he continues these efforts far into the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="religion"></category></entry><entry><title>A Cookbook Response to Jordan Peterson</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2018/May/22/a-cookbook-response-to-jordan-peterson/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-05-22T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-05-22T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2018-05-22:/posts/2018/May/22/a-cookbook-response-to-jordan-peterson/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've reproduced below Sam Harris' incredible example of interpreting texts.

&lt;p&gt;Once you read Harris' Cookbook exposition, you never see Peterson the same again.  Peterson claims that he only believes those interpretations that can be tied to four difference levels of understanding simultaneously, but I think that ends up being a smokescreen and that the same linguistic gymnastics can be done even in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="from-sam-harris-the-end-of-faith"&gt;From &lt;a href="https://samharris.org/books/the-end-of-faith/"&gt;Sam Harris, &lt;em&gt;The End of Faith&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with such hermeneutical efforts [...] is that they are perfectly unconstrained by the contents of the texts themselves. One can interpret every text in such a way as to yield almost any mystical or occult instruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A case in point: I have selected another book at random, this time from the cookbook aisle of a bookstore. The book is &lt;em&gt;A Taste of Hawaii: New Cooking from the Crossroads of the Pacific&lt;/em&gt;. Therein I have discovered an as yet uncelebrated mystical treatise. While it appears to be a recipe for wok-seared fish and shrimp cakes with ogo-tomato relish, we need only study its list of ingredients to know that we are in the presence of an unrivaled spiritual intelligence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;snapper filet, cubed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 teaspoons chopped scallions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;salt and freshly ground black pepper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a dash of cayenne pepper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 teaspoons chopped fresh ginger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 teaspoon minced garlic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8 shrimp, peeled, deveined, and cubed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1⁄2 cup heavy cream; 2 eggs, lightly beaten&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 teaspoons rice wine; 2 cups bread crumbs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 tablespoons vegetable oil; 2 1⁄2 cups ogo-tomato relish&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;snapper filet&lt;/em&gt;, of course, is the individual himself —you and I— awash in the sea of existence. But here we find it cubed, which is to say that our situation must be remedied in all three dimensions of body, mind, and spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Three teaspoons of chopped scallions&lt;/em&gt; further partakes of the cubic symmetry, suggesting that that which we need add to each level of our being by way of antidote comes likewise in equal proportions. The import of the passage is clear: the body, mind, and spirit need to be tended to with the same care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Salt and freshly ground black pepper&lt;/em&gt;: here we have the perennial invocation of opposites—the white and the black aspects of our nature. Both good and evil must be understood if we would fulfill the recipe for spiritual life. Nothing, after all, can be excluded from the human experience (this seems to be a Tantric text). What is more, salt and pepper come to us in the form of grains, which is to say that our good and bad qualities are born of the tiniest actions. Thus, we are not good or evil in general, but only by virtue of innumerable moments, which color the stream of our being by force of repetition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A dash of cayenne pepper&lt;/em&gt;: clearly, being of such robust color and flavor, this signifies the spiritual influence of an enlightened adept. What shall we make of the ambiguity of its measurement? How large is a dash? Here we must rely upon the wisdom of the universe at large. The teacher himself will know precisely what we need by way of instruction. And it is at just this point in the text that the ingredients that bespeak the heat of spiritual endeavor are added to the list—for after a dash of cayenne pepper, we find two teaspoons of chopped fresh ginger and one teaspoon of minced garlic. These form an isosceles trinity of sorts, signifying the two sides of our spiritual nature (male and female) united with the object meditation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next comes &lt;em&gt;eight shrimp—peeled, deveined, and cubed&lt;/em&gt;. The eight shrimp, of course, represent the eight worldly concerns that every spiritual aspirant must decry: fame and shame; loss and gain; pleasure and pain; praise and blame. Each needs to be deveined, peeled, and cubed— that is, purged of its power to entrance us and incorporated on the path of practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That such metaphorical acrobatics can be performed on almost any text—and that they are therefore meaningless—should be obvious.&lt;/p&gt;

Two questions were raised as evidence for God that I think are telling:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how do you get life from non-life?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how do you get the personal from the impersonal?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answers to these questions points to the properties of God, as traditionally understood.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first reaction is, even if we didn’t know the answers to these questions we would still not be in a position to make a positive claim for the explanation (e.g. God) without making the further step of obtaining evidence for the positive claim.  This is a God-of-the-Gaps move.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, although neither question is understood in sufficient detail, we have made substantial progress in understanding the &lt;a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/abioprob/"&gt;origin of life&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness#Scientific_study"&gt;origin of consciousness&lt;/a&gt;.  Far more progress than is made by assuming an agent simply created it.  We should avoid jumping to a positive claim without the evidence for that claim, and note our tendency to do just that in the face of mystery.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="religion"></category><category term="Unbelievable Project"></category><category term="religion"></category></entry><entry><title>Getting the Definitions Right</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2018/Feb/18/getting-the-definitions-right/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-02-18T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-02-18T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2018-02-18:/posts/2018/Feb/18/getting-the-definitions-right/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I posted before about  &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/3-reasons-why-belief-in-god-makes-sense.html"&gt;3 Reasons Why Belief in God Makes Sense&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="https://www.premierchristianradio.com/Shows/Saturday/Unbelievable" title="Unbelievable Podcast"&gt;Unbelievable Podcast&lt;/a&gt;.

In &lt;a href="https://www.christiantoday.com/article/3-reasons-im-not-an-atheist-and-im-still-a-christian/111411.htm"&gt;another article&lt;/a&gt;, Justin Brierley comments on some of his observations as the moderator of atheist-theist debates.  Some of his observations, unfortunately, are wrong.   For example,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Almost every atheist I meet wears the spectacles of 'naturalism'. It's the view that there is no supernatural dimension to existence. All that really exists is physical matter in motion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sounds suspiciously like “philosophical naturalism”, to which I know of &lt;em&gt;no one&lt;/em&gt; who ascribes.  There is &lt;em&gt;“methodological naturalism”&lt;/em&gt; which simply states that we may assume, for the moment as a practical matter, that there isn’t a supernatural realm.  We’ll continue to assume that until someone can demonstrate the supernatural.  This isn’t as much wearing “spectacles of ‘naturalism’” but the only pragmatic choice an honest inquiry can support.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way to look at it is to notice that science evaluates &lt;em&gt;well-defined claims&lt;/em&gt;. We know of no method which can handle non-well-defined claims and we have yet to see a &lt;em&gt;definition&lt;/em&gt; of supernatural that is well defined.   Is there one?  Until someone puts forward something useful, we can proceed without including it in our descriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Consequently, there is no realm of right or wrong to be discovered in life, no overarching purpose to things, no ultimate meaning to reach for in the universe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is also possibly wrong, and I dealt with it in the &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/3-reasons-why-belief-in-god-makes-sense.html"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;.  Even if you’re not convinced of this argument, you have to admit there is - for some people - a reasonable argument for morality under naturalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When BBC broadcaster and atheist scientist Jim Al-Khalili came on my Unbelievable? show he acknowledged: 'It's a huge philosophical question: why does nature speak the language of mathematics?'. Nobel Prize winning physicist Eugene Wigner termed it 'the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics', describing it as a 'wonderful gift we neither understand nor deserve’.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Are we to simply say 'pass' on this question?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this is a necessary fact?  Perhaps there is an explanation, but we don’t have access to it?  God, however, is no explanation.  As Robert Price notes, you’re trying to explain unknown X with unknown double-X!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our belief in the intrinsic dignity and worth of human beings is best explained by Christianity. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights tapped into a foundational view of humanity established by our Judeo-Christian heritage, one which we jettison at our peril. Our belief in the intrinsic value of humanity can't be explained by atheism. But if we are made in the image of God, as Christianity claims, then that gives every human being inestimable value.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except, the Bible itself clearly delineates superior and inferior people!  It specifies, in great detail, how one should treat slavery depending on whether they are the chosen people or not.  Furthermore, Jesus - despite some of his better messages - never speaks against that and tacitly endorses it with the &lt;a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/5-18.htm"&gt;“not one jot of the law will be abolished”&lt;/a&gt; statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All-in-all I find Justin’s claims here, despite his good intentions, to be a testament to confirmation bias - which perhaps I am suffering from as well?  How can I tell?  &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="religion"></category></entry><entry><title>3 Reasons Why Belief In God Makes Sense</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2018/Feb/06/3-reasons-why-belief-in-god-makes-sense/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-02-06T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-02-06T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2018-02-06:/posts/2018/Feb/06/3-reasons-why-belief-in-god-makes-sense/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In a new book, Justin Brierley of the very good &lt;a href="https://www.premierchristianradio.com/Shows/Saturday/Unbelievable" title="Unbelievable Podcast"&gt;Unbelievable Podcast&lt;/a&gt; writes about &lt;a href="https://www.premierchristianradio.com/Shows/Saturday/Unbelievable/Articles/3-Reasons-Why-Belief-In-God-Makes-Sense"&gt;3 Reasons Why Belief in God Makes Sense&lt;/a&gt;.

These reasons aren’t particularly compelling to me.  They are the following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="god-makes-sense-of-human-existence"&gt;God Makes Sense Of Human Existence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, Justin cites the Fine Tuning Argument, which has its best take-down in the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R97IHcuyWI0"&gt;Sean-Carroll/William Lane Craig debate&lt;/a&gt;.  It’s really an argument from physics, and the physics isn’t at all clear on whether the effect is there, or whether the interpretation of the effect is even reasonable.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="god-makes-sense-of-human-value"&gt;God Makes Sense Of Human Value&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, Justin states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why exactly do we believe that human life should be valued? Why did Jaime do the right thing – the human thing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find it very hard to come up with an answer on an atheistic world view. Why should humans have any more claim for special regard on the biological tree of life than a louse? There’s nothing intrinsically special about us in a universe that is blindly obeying the laws of nature. Any beliefs in objective human rights, values and morality are ultimately an illusion, a side-effect of our evolutionary history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I think &lt;a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/sam_harris_science_can_show_what_s_right"&gt;Sam Harris has the best word&lt;/a&gt; for this but &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq2C7fyVTA4"&gt;Matt Dillahunty also does quite well&lt;/a&gt; with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="god-makes-sense-of-human-purpose"&gt;God Makes Sense Of Human Purpose&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Justin states, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atheism and Christianity tell two very different stories – one is of ultimate purposelessness and the other is of ultimate hope. Hope that there is a reason for our existence, hope that our lives mean something, the hope that death is not the end. Is it a delusion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word “purpose” I think is a little less defined than I’d like, but it seems that if heaven exists then there really is no purpose for this life.  I am also not convinced that purpose requires an infinite time - that if you exist for a finite time then you can have purpose.  It may also be the case that there is no purpose - but how we feel about that should have no effect on the truth.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="religion"></category></entry><entry><title>Matter, Energy, and the Spirit</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2018/Jan/31/matter-energy-and-the-spirit/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-01-31T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-01-31T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2018-01-31:/posts/2018/Jan/31/matter-energy-and-the-spirit/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Theists seem to critique naturalism with the claim that there is more to the universe than just "matter and energy".

However, even physicists have in their models certain entities which cannot be categorized as either matter or energy. The quantum wavefunction is one clear example. There is also a history of introducing entities into models which later turn out to be unnecessary - "Vis viva" (i.e. life force), "phlogiston" (i.e. heat fluid), and "celestial matter" (vs terrestial matter). It is not that scientists are dogmatically against such entities, it's just that they should be dropped when they don't explain and predict anything or alternative explanations are simpler and more direct. We don't use agency to explain the motion of the planets anymore, for example, but we once did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other entities in models which serve as placeholders for the unknown, for example "dark matter". No one seriously thinks labeling the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_rotation_curve"&gt;gravitational effect observed from galactic rotation curves&lt;/a&gt; is better understood once we label it "dark matter". It is just a placeholder, until we figure out what dark matter actually is - neutrinos, black holes, altered gravitation on large scale, etc...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given this backdrop, what explanative and predictive power do the terms "spirit" and "supernatural agency" have anymore? Can we name anything that we understand better with their inclusion than we do without? What direct observations make these entities useful in any model of the universe, beyond as a placeholder for the unknown?  &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="religion"></category></entry><entry><title>Naturalism Defined</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2018/Jan/22/naturalism-defined/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-01-22T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-01-22T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2018-01-22:/posts/2018/Jan/22/naturalism-defined/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The question of supernatural vs. natural has come up a lot in discussions with Christians.

Such quotes as "&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalism_(philosophy)"&gt;Naturalism&lt;/a&gt; is ambiguous. What is nature and what isn't nature?", "Naturalism is vacuous. It's only tenet is an entirely reactionary one - no theology", and "Naturalism is unable to ground its own intelligibility which means it collapses into nihilism" abound.  Philosopher  Alvin Plantinga has an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_argument_against_naturalism"&gt;Evolutionary argument against naturalism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way I see it is the following.  There used to be a distinction between "terrestrial" and "celestial" matter. Then it was determined that the planets obeyed the same rules as the apples falling from trees and the need for the distinction disappeared. "Celestial" matter disappeared as did "terrestrial" matter leaving just "matter". Since then, we have determined, that pretty much everything we can observe follows the same rules - although some get blurred at different scales (microscopic vs macroscopic, for example). Naturalism then is simply the recognition that the stuff we see day-to-day operates on the same principles as the stars in the early universe, and the galaxies far far away. So if you can show us something that is observable yet doesn't follow these rules - something which follows a separate set of rules - then perhaps it might be time to introduce the distinction between natural and supernatural. Otherwise, there is no need for the added concept of the supernatural. Is there such an observable? What are its rules?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a side-note, this means that naturalism need not "ground its own intelligibility". It is just the recognition that we can develop rules using the material on the Earth and make predictions over a wide range of time and space. There really isn't anything more we could ask of it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="religion"></category></entry></feed>
