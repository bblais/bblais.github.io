&lt;p&gt;It's 9 hours long, but I am only on for the first 7 hours.  This isn't a complete log of everything said, but I tried to include the main points.  I also started with a transcript, and edited it for clarity (e.g. removing ums, and repetition) but there may still be some weird typos from the computer generated transcript that I didn't catch. I will try to quote Nathan, James, Kamil and myself if it comes from the episode.  All other text is mine, commentary either at the time or sometime afterward. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/yeCBpO7pSRM?t=10788"&gt;Time stamp 2:59:48&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamil: this is actually one of the strongest reasons for me to doubt the eyewitness testimony behind the Gospels especially if you think that the Gospels were written in the genre of Greco-Roman historical biography.  [...] if you think that, then it's actually really, really unexpected that the authors of the Gospel of Mark and the Gospel of Matthew, for example, don't explicitly say they are based on eyewitness testimony.  Because eyewitness testimony was very highly valued in ancient historigrapphy and I find it consistently over and over again. When it's the case that the historian in question actually had eyewitness testimony available, that they were the eyewitnesses themselves or they had access to eyewitness testimony, they say that explicitly in the text.  It is actually very, very difficult to find instances where it's the case that they had access to eyewitnesses but they don't actually proactively disclose it. [...] I would absolutely expect Mark to say "this account is based on the memory of Apostle Peter". I would absolutely expect, for example, the Gospel of Matthew to say, I Matthew, The Apostle was called by Jesus or something like that because that's exactly what we observe over and over again in other historical accounts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an example of data which is expected on the hypothesis of eyewitness testimony, which is seemingly required for the McGrews to make any headway in their case to support the Resurrection.  This data is also simply not dealt with, or written off as an argument from silence (which it isn't).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamil:  So this is like a one piece of evidence that massively goes against the hypothesis of eyewitness testimony that actually, for me, the strength of that evidence is so overwhelming that it actually overcomes all of the early Christian attestation to the authorship&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/yeCBpO7pSRM?t=11217"&gt;Time stamp 3:06:57&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James: We're about to get to looking at the the data that we're then going to compare explanations against . And what we'll see is that when they reject or argue against non resurrection explanations, they are happy to pick literally any detail from the gospels that suits their purpose. Very specific, very particular, minute sometimes detail. And the question would be, "Well, why should we accept that that is the case?" And it seems to me that we're going to have to go beyond a general reliability to get to that. We're going to actually have to go to like, basically, this was written not just by an eyewitness, but someone with a really good memory and got all of the details down. So by feeling free to appeal to all of these details, they're actually setting up a very high standard for themselves in terms of how confident can we be in these details. So to put it another way, it's very much not a minimal facts approach. We'll see the sort of details that they're appealing to and like it really does, then heavily rely on how reliable we think all of these details are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pasted image 20220417200453.png" src="https://bblais.github.io/images/Pasted image 20220417200453.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the first of many examples where they argue against a claim by appealing to the fact that it is &lt;em&gt;intrinsically highly improbable&lt;/em&gt; -- which is a prior, the part of the calculation that they are definitely not talking about with respect to theists claims.  As Bart Ehrman pointed out, it might be improbable -- but it is more probable than a miracle!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamil: Yeah, but but it's always the case with minimal effects, right? Like you start by saying, this is just a list of minimal facts. And yes, that's true.  30 minutes later. It's no really, there were people who thought they saw Jesus eating a piece of fish in front of them. So how do you explain that a naturalism, right? They could not have hallucinated it because it was tactile and hallucinations are not like interpersonal and tactile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian: I always find it telling that the list of minimal facts never seems to be an agreement from one apologist to another. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamil:  The swoon hypothesis is specifically aimed against Muslims, right? Because in the Koran, it says that Jesus didn't really die, but how they argue against it actually doesn't have any force against what the Muslims believe. Because in the Koran, it says that Jesus didn't die, but it looked like he did. So like Allah made it look like he died, which is obviously completely consistent with the historical account, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pasted image 20220430132503.png" src="https://bblais.github.io/images/Pasted image 20220430132503.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nathan: so when they compare the evidence, they say, how do we expect the evidence to look given "not the resurrection", right? Well, that would be exactly the same in that case because the evidence would look exactly the same, so it shouldn't do anything to that numerator denominator distinction. The ratio should just remain, but they don't do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And note again, that they criticize the swoon hypothesis because it is "intrinsically improbable", which is the prior they don't want to have to address on their own view &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/yeCBpO7pSRM?t=11611"&gt;Time stamp 3:13:31&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nathan: They say one of the problems here for the skeptic who goes with this and I don't think any of us do go with the swoon theory. But he says, for example, you've got to "dismiss John's account of the spear wound as inauthentic". Well, that theory actually coheres with other details like, for example, the mistranslation of prophetic fulfillment.  It might be the case that they were reading the Septuagint to figure out what happened about Jesus life.  I think like that coheres quite nicely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pasted image 20220430133210.png" src="https://bblais.github.io/images/Pasted image 20220430133210.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nathan: they go on to talk about this John Dominic Crossan, something that his theory and then they say, you know, that his "radical position", well everything that they're saying is radically out of line with New Testament scholarship.  But it's again, just not the type of language that you really expect from an academic volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James: Look, when &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt;  say something, it's an "inference". It's an "argument". It's "based on evidence", "growing body of evidence" when &lt;em&gt;someone else&lt;/em&gt; says it. Oh, it's just a "guess". It's a "mere extrapolation". It's a "radical position". It's just fluff. Like, there's no actual distinction here between what different people are doing. It's just whether they agree with that or they don't agree with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/yeCBpO7pSRM?t=12143"&gt;Time stamp 3:22:23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamil: I'd also also like that there is no shortage of people who believe that a person was raised from the dead, even though that person has a known burial location that supposedly contains the body.  it demonstrates two things. First of all, that people who hold the belief that the person was raised are not interested in actually confirming that with physical evidence.  They don't  sneak up into the graveyard and dig up the grave to see if it has a body in it. Probably exactly for the reasons like if they were actually presented with the body they'd  probably dismiss it. And second of all, the other people who don't share that belief are not interested in debunking it by exhuming the person and showing the body  because it's more important for them not to disturb  the burial customs of the person than to debunk that specific claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, there is the famous Jewish rabbi (Menachem Mendel Schneerson) who claims to be a messiah. And apparently, they are still people who believe that he was resurrected, even though there is a zero empirical evidence for it. He actually has a known burial location. And also what's very important to realize is that even the people in the position of leadership in that specific sect of Judaism denied that claim. There were actual leaders who said, "no, he wasn't raised." But despite all of that, yeah, there are still adherents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This point, to me, shatters the entire apologetic edifice around the Resurrection.  To have a parallel case like this, where all of the boxes are checked for belief, with the only difference between this rabbi and Jesus is that we have fewer pieces of evidence concerning Jesus.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James: The point that I wanted to make with that example is though, that to say that" oh well, they must have had really good evidence, right? And their opponents mustn't, if anything, good to say, because if they did, then that would have dissuaded the people from from believing it." But we've just given a couple of examples. I cite a number more in my book about irrational belief persistence. There's so many cases of this that the claim that they would have stopped believing unless they had good evidence, there's just no reason for thinking that --  it's just assertion. There's so much evidence that that isn't the case. That's just not how people work in these contexts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/yeCBpO7pSRM?t=13077"&gt;Time stamp 3:37:57&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pasted image 20220430172852.png" src="https://bblais.github.io/images/Pasted image 20220430172852.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James: &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(W\)&lt;/span&gt; Is women's testimony, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(D\)&lt;/span&gt; is for the disciples, which includes seeing and being willing to die and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P\)&lt;/span&gt; is for the conversion of Paul. So these are the three main facts that they wanting to put in their sort of Bayesian calculation, And they're going to say that these facts here are overwhelmingly more likely  under the resurrection hypothesis than other than not-resurrection hypothesis. So that's what the next few sections are going to be is going through each of these in turn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian: Make sure every time you see this, instead of saying, you know, the women who claim to have found the tomb empty or there were disciples who claim to have appearances of the resurrection,  say instead that that we have &lt;em&gt;texts&lt;/em&gt; that say that there are women who claim to have found the empty tomb, that we have &lt;em&gt;texts&lt;/em&gt; that say that there were post resurrection appearances of Jesus.  The data is not the claim itself, it's not the story,  it's the fact that we have a &lt;em&gt;text&lt;/em&gt; that has the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/yeCBpO7pSRM?t=13214"&gt;Time stamp 3:40:14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pasted image 20220526062929.png" src="https://bblais.github.io/images/Pasted image 20220526062929.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nathan: But here's one point to focus on. So they're going to appeal a lot to consensus in New Testament scholarship. They're going to say, In a survey of recent New Testament scholarship, Gary Habemus has documented the interesting fact that a notable majority, approximately 75 percent of scholars writing on the subject during the thirty years from 1975 to 2005 agree that Jesus tomb was in fact found empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James:  they have just been telling us at some length how unreliable the methods that most scholars who analyze this, like the critical scholars, the people that they don't like, right? So apparently, we shouldn't believe anything that they say -- we should discount them,  it's not really reliable. But now we're being told that the fact that most scholars, including this big group that we shouldn't listen to, think that something is true is a reason for believing it. They do this in other cases as well later on. Again, it's eating a cake and having it to. Look, if we disagree with them, they're unreliable.  But when they agree with us, we'll say, Oh, you know, this consensus of scholarship, you know, most scholars agree with us here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamil: Also, this statement is factually false. Habermas has published this  number in the literature, but he doesn't say that 75 percent of scholar agree that Jesus's empty tomb is a fact. What he says specifically, is that approximately 75 percent of scholars think that  at least one of the arguments for the empty tomb has force or something like that. My hypothesis is that he phrases it like this so that it's not that explicit claim. He's not reporting the number of scholars who are convinced of the empty tomb to fudge the numbers. Because he could count in those 75 percent even scholars who are, for example, agnostic about it as long as they think that at least one of the arguments for the empty tomb is an interesting argument to look at. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamil: I want to highlight this because here we see Lydia McGrew and Timothy McGrew reporting something other than what Gary Habermas reported. So here we have an example of how information is distorted, when is what is retold like. The meaning is different and it's &lt;em&gt;substantively&lt;/em&gt; different. It's very important that the difference is not superficial. It's actually very, very important. There's a distortion of information that took place, even though we live in an environment where it's super easy and super convenient to get access to the text &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; as  Gary Habermas wrote it. Gary Habermas is still alive and I'm sure he would be able to answer any questions if they sent him an email. Now, imagine how much worse these kinds of distortions were in a society where people were not literate, they couldn't easily get a handle of the people who made the various claims that they are reporting.  They did not have instant access to texts as they were originally written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian: It's clear the McGraw's are right here because I don't hear Gary Habermas contradicting this and he'd be in a position to contradict this if it were actually incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/yeCBpO7pSRM?t=13685"&gt;Time stamp 3:48:05&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James:  there is a massive confusion between textual independence and independence of the witnesses that allegedly underpin that text. So it could be the case that I mean, obviously the Synoptics are not textual independent, but suppose that John and the Synoptics  are textually independent. And what I mean by that is that they sat down to write their text separately from each other that hadn't seen. Obviously, Mark hadn't seen John, but John hadn't seen the Synoptics  before (hypothetically). That would make them textually independent. But even if even if all four were textually independent, somehow that wouldn't make them independent of the underlying eyewitness testimony, which was based on a set of people who mostly experienced Jesus together, who talked to each other, as it says, even in the Gospels, and who allegedly came up with a creed that stated in propositional form some of the key beliefs that they had and passed it on to Paul and then that was disseminated in the other church. That is not what independent testimony looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamil: So you're saying something like the group appearances are actually evidence &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; the resurrection because like, it would be much more powerful if Jesus appears to people like individuals independent  of each other?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James: Yes, absolutely. That would be far more convincing, especially if they're in different cultures, that would be very much more convincing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pasted image 20220526063028.png" src="https://bblais.github.io/images/Pasted image 20220526063028.png"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Pasted image 20220526063110.png" src="https://bblais.github.io/images/Pasted image 20220526063110.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/yeCBpO7pSRM?t=13955"&gt;Time stamp 3:52:35&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nathan: On the other point, as well as to when they say the tensions in the narrative are evidence against copying, for example, because anyone who was copying could have gone. "I'm not going to introduce tension because that will make people further down the line think that, you know, like the stories don't cohere. But what if the later author, who had access to some earlier texts, actually disagreed theologically with something, is copying, but then decides, actually, I want to emphasize a different theological point. And so moves around the ordering of a story or maybe changes something. I mean, I think that stuff happens.And that introduces for us a tension story. And I don't think that that precludes copying. That would just be the motive that that would so they would have copied.  The case that there's a tension doesn't rule out copying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James: I wonder how it rules out &lt;em&gt;embellishment&lt;/em&gt;. They say it rules out embellishment the fact that they include different details. But that's exactly what embellishment is, right? That's particularly bizarre. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="on-the-contradictions-as-evidence"&gt;On the contradictions as evidence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James: And so I don't see why you would expect this at all if I imagine that you were interviewing witnesses to a crime or some other event like and they tell you accounts that are somewhat similar. But the people that are involved are different and only partially overlap, and they're coming at different times. And there's all these other details as the McGrews acknowledge here, they give some examples that don't seem to obviously make sense and seem quite different. You would think that, well, look, maybe something happened here, but that these people are not terribly reliable,  they don't quite remember things properly or  they weren't really paying attention. Something's going on there, right? You wouldn't just think, Wow, this is really, obviously good testimony because, yeah, because they contradict. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James: And the short ending of Mark has basically nothing in common with the other accounts, except for the fact that the tomb is empty, like the women see it and then they're scared, and they and they run away and don't tell anyone.   That  has nothing in common with the others which say that they told the disciples and the disciples came, at least one of them did, and then that Jesus appeared to the disciples. How can you say that those are just circumstantial variety? There's massive differences in the account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James: And it's not like people deliberately make these things up. It's like "it must have been". This is this is what Modern-Day  evangelicals do when they write their their harmonizations - "it must have been" then it turns into a new fact. So I think that that's probably like Well, "it must have been" that the women found it, but because no one would have taken them seriously, they didn't tell anyone --  because it accounts for why no one's heard of it before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamil: This is actually very consistent with our background knowledge about how, like ancient historiographers put together their accounts because it's often the case, some  historiographical  accounts are actually just very plausible reconstructions of what must have happened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamil: for example, imagine that the author of The Gospel of Luke, a belief that Jesus was raised from the dead, [...] And based on those beliefs he created  a speculative version, what he perceived as as a plausible way the  resurrection appearances would play out. And this is why we actually have the text and it is not because there were actually people in history who experienced Jesus.  Plus, I think he was doing a lot of theological work as well. Like it specifically says that Jesus ate a piece of fish to rule out  believing that he's a ghost or phantasma, I think it says in Greek, which is a counter apologetic against people who believe that Jesus didn't have a physical body when he was around on Earth.  And I think the text being a product of this kind of historiographical practice is massively more inherently probable than Jesus &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; being raised from the dead, &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; appearing to people and &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; eating fish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian: Is it reasonable as a possibility that Mark, for instance, the women finding the tomb only because someone would make the argument that he wouldn't have put it in there unless it were true. And so this is a way of kind of making his stories sound more true, almost like I think the preface in Luke is kind of like that, where you  insert something that makes it sound like it's  legit. I think Lovecraft used to do that, throwing things in a fictional place (like a statement from a real journalist) to make it sound more legitimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian: Now, another another possibility, then, is if this argument has some weight that essentially having women testimony, it would be embarrassing and wouldn't be in it unless it were somehow legitimate, then you could think of almost textual or oral tradition evolution, where those stories that included that detail would be the ones that would get passed down.  It's an evolutionary argument for why we we end up with a text that has it, because that's the story that would have been told again and again, and it had this extra little element of, "Oh, and it's got to be true because..."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamil:  That's a really interesting hypothesis, one possible hypothesis would be that this is a double bluff. Right? The author realized that, "Oh, if I put this detail, it's going to make it look more historically reliable precisely because it's counter intuitive". But this is another alternative that it's a process of natural selection, which selects for stories that look authentic, even though historically, they are not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James:  Well, look, the reason like this is why it says this is because people hadn't heard about this before. So they all thought the gospels need to explain why no one's heard about it before, at least why it's not more widely known, perhaps. So they're saying, Well, look, it was women and no one believed them or that the disciples didn't initially believe them. So maybe they didn't know about it, something like that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamil: Well, on my hypothesis, it actually becomes super, super easy to understand. By the time the gospel of Matthew is written, the author has not encountered the objection that the story is unreliable. By the time the gospel of Luke is written, this counter-apologetic is already the case. So there needs to be a counter-counter apologetic baked into the narrative to explain away or to invent additional data points to overcome the apologetic against the story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James: One thing that the McGrews never do is ask the question, let's suppose the resurrection really did happen[...] four people who were there, or at least people who based their accounts on four people who were there, wrote down an account of Jesus life, what would we expect those accounts to look like?  How does that then compare to what we actually have?  It's obviously going to be speculative, but I think it captures rather poorly.  You just look at the resurrection accounts as an example of that, that they're so different.  And the McGrews try to explain this to explain this away by just, well, you know, they could choose to talk about whatever they want, right? They don't have to say everything. Just because they don't say it, doesn't mean that they're saying it &lt;em&gt;didn't&lt;/em&gt; happen.  But that just seems to me a really lazy argument.  The fact is that you would expect, I think, to have a stronger concordance of what they actually do say and of what the events that actually happen. That itself wouldn't prove that they're historical because you still have issues of copying. But I don't think what you would expect to see is these sharp divergences between what you see in Mark and what you see in Matthew, say, and what you see in John, where they're so different.  There's different theological overtones, there's different ordering of events, there's different things happening in different places. Is that really what you would expect to see? And I don't think it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamil: how how plausible it is that if it's the case that both the appearance in Galilee and the appearances around Jerusalem happened in history, how plausible it is that we would get one gospel mentioning only Galilee and the other gospel mentioning only Jerusalem. This is super easy to explain or my hypothesis, right?  [...]  It's not the issue of how much they explain, how much they narrate. It's the issue of there not being any overlap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, Timothy McGrew, when he gave a talk, he used a really interesting analogy to neutralize this kind of objection and it utilizes the fact that Lydia McGrew happens to be an orphan who was adopted to foster family. And he says, "Look, you could give two completely different accounts about Lydia, which both are going to be factually accurate. It's just they're going to be different because in one of them, you will be only talking about her original family and you will omit all the details about her being adopted, and the other account you will only talk about her adopted family, and you will omit the detail that she was adopted". And in that talk, he says, "when I present people with this they can't believe that it's actually describing the same person, even though it is."  And I'm thinking, Yeah, my point, exactly.   Why is it the case that people are surprised that it's not describing the same person? Well, because that's not how people narrate stories!  The surprise of people, is evidence for that being really, really implausible.  It's really implausible that you would narrate the two different accounts. Basically, they would only have appearances at one place, and the other appearances in a different place if both sets of appearances actually took place. This is the same with the birth narrative of Jesus. Right? But there is almost no overlap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pasted image 20220710120154.png" src="https://bblais.github.io/images/Pasted image 20220710120154.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James: the accounts say that the women told them that Jesus had risen.  Peter runs to the tomb and sees that it's empty and then Jesus appears to him. So I think you've got a case where the women tell the disciples, Hey, Jesus has risen, and then the disciples are now in a state of expectation and I presume excitement as well.  I just think that this is not even consistent with the accounts, assuming all the details of the accounts are accurate, which I don't. But even if you just take it on face value, that isn't what the accounts say. There's no instance in where Jesus appears to all of the 11 prior to having appeared to at least one of the women or and or a single disciple beforehand. And that person, having told the rest of them, there's always an individual appearance, which is then reported to the group first, which is exactly consistent with my account, which says that there was a contamination effect, that an individual hallucination or some other experience which was reported to the group led to an expectation that prompted collective experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nathan: I think of that there's a Netflix documentary released recently on supernatural claims and there are a lot of people in that who  had children who had died and they were grieving in those states. And then whenever a medium would tell them I've contacted and I'm talking to your child. Initially, the initial contact, someone would kind of be like, "Yeah, I'm skeptical. I'm skeptical. I have always thought of myself, you know, I'm an atheist, a freethinker, So I'm really skeptical of things like this." But then when they're told that, they sort of they dwell on it for like a week or so afterwards, and all of a sudden it becomes more plausible because of the hope that it kind of gives them that that child is somewhere that can be contacted and isn't isn't gone. And then they use that initial skepticism as evidence that they must be correct because, "I was such a skeptic, I would not have concluded that this is a case of truth."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James:  So that point about the saying that they were skeptical. That's called avowal of prior skepticism. We've talked about this in my book before. I cite in my book how this is a known and is a discursive strategy that people use to try to highlight the paranormal activity taken seriously. Both in paranormal and religious experiences it's very common.  It's interesting to me, having actually looked at some of this literature that so many of the things that are appealed to as sort of features are actually known in the broader literature as strategies or tendencies. So one is the avowal of prior skepticism. Another one is irrational belief persistence,  concocting ever more elaborate explanations for why the belief should be held. Memory contagion would be another one that seems relevant here, trying to develop a just-so account as well. This is how it must have been kind of thing. So I think this article is similar to many others in that they just pretty much ignore most, if not all, of this sort of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian:  I think earlier on in the text, we  saw that they were just going to take all these statements as essentially given - everything in the text we can just take as true. Why would they consider these other things, when they're just going to take every single statement in the Gospels as true?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pasted image 20220710121603.png" src="https://bblais.github.io/images/Pasted image 20220710121603.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James:  Imagine if Jesus said "blessed are those who proportioned their belief, according to the evidence?", of how different would things have been if he'd said something like that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nathan: how do we know that they were dying &lt;em&gt;for that claim&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James: How could you establish someone who's willing to die for something -- that it's literally, specifically for that claim?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nathan: think about the persecution of Muslims by China.  It's not specifically, the Chinese government is like, "Oh, what's your theology? What are the propositions in your theology?" It's just that they belong to that group.   I suppose we're talking about Jewish persecution and Roman persecution. The Jewish kind of persecution is just going to be anyone who deviates from the prevailing theology that the relevant power groups have. And then the Roman kind of persecution is kind of going to be similar, but it's just a different set of beliefs. And it doesn't it doesn't mean that it's specifically for because of the truth of this claim that Jesus had risen again, that that might be one of the claims that they believe it could just be for being associated with this group preaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James:  the Romans wouldn't care less whether the Christians believe that Jesus or the dead, what they cared about was that they wouldn't sacrifice to the emperors and that they were spreading a religion that was therefore politically destabilizing. So if they recanted that, I mean, the Romans couldn't have cared less about that. [...] did anyone actually persecute them specifically because of the particular theological belief of the bodily resurrection? I'm not convinced that that was the case. What's the evidence of that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James:  The point is that to say that we know that 13 of them were willing to die for a specific claim. First of all, we don't even know much of anything about what happened to most of them. Second of all, we don't know that they were willing to die, because how do you establish that even if someone actually dies, you can't establish that they were willing to die because it might have happened just to try to avoid it? I don't know how you establish that, but let alone establish that they were willing to die &lt;em&gt;specifically&lt;/em&gt; for that proposition, as opposed to a whole bunch of other things that they may be willing to die for, just as like the general belief that Jesus was the Messiah, for example. So apologists just push this so hard when there's actually so little evidence for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamil: The Jews were persecuting Christians on the basis of the Mosaic Law and the Mosaic Law. The prescription for blasphemy is death, and it doesn't matter if you're sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pasted image 20220710123547.png" src="https://bblais.github.io/images/Pasted image 20220710123547.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamil: So apologists use this line of this detail in the Gospel to essentially establish that the disciples would not believe in Jesus's resurrection unless Jesus really appeared to them physically, unless they had  visual, auditory and tactile experiences of his body because they were aware of things like ghosts which don't have physical bodies. The point is that on the background knowledge, ghosts don't have physical bodies, so they had to experience something that would rule out that explanation. That's the apologetic line of reasoning. Because if it was the case that they didn't experience Jesus having a physical body, they would just conclude that that was a ghost that wasn't actually bodily resurrection. But if you look at the relevant background knowledge, you find no shortage of ancient accounts where ghosts, phantasma, spirits, these kinds of entities actually do appear to have physical bodies. For example, they fight people, they have sex, and they eat.  There was an apparation of Helen in some of the retellings of the Trojan War while the actual Helen was in Egypt the whole time. And the apparition tricked everyone into believing that Helen is in Troy for 10 years. While she ate, supposedly had sex with Paris and then the second husband. So this apologetic actually doesn't work about Jesus. Having a physical body would not convince people in the first century that he's not a ghost, because in the first century, we have ghost stories about ghosts having physical bodies.  For [Luke], it's important for Jesus to have a physical body for theological reasons. 
 Because then that means people are going to be given resurrection bodies after the general resurrection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James: "inspiring, kindly and helpful"  He's portrayed consistently by the same author.  How could that have happened unless it was so?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nathan: "a touch of amusement in his tone" I mean, again, it just seems exactly like narrative devices like when I was doing high school English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James:  We started talking about the appearances are reasons to think the source of the appearances date back to eyewitness testimony. That is, that they're genuine accounts of the disciples having related these experiences, not them having been developed later.  So when that's your goal and the best thing you can come up with to say is, well, it's consistent with how Jesus is treated in the earlier part of the gospel that also narrates the appearances.  It's the just-say-anything response. [...]  I think what they're really saying is that it &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; convincing to them,  It &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; genuine so therefore it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James:  why is it that if something was if "the experience was based on some sort of spiritual rush of enthusiasm that led to a group experience of risen Jesus", blah blah blah that that would somehow preclude them claiming to have "extensive and direct personal communication with the risen Jesus"?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamil: this makes sense on the assumption that the content of the gospel is just written down what the disciples really sincerely believe they experienced. But of course, on our hypothesis, what the content of the post-resurrection narratives in the Gospels  has almost nothing or very little to do what actually, the followers of Jesus experience shortly after he was crucified and died - those are two completely different stories. And the reason why the text is that way has nothing to do, almost nothing to do with what was actually going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nathan:  Sorry, I was just an irrelevant conversation about why would you wear a mask when you're vaccinated Having these kind of conversations about religion always brings out people with like crap epistemology about other beliefs as well.  Oh, you're skeptical about the vaccine? And you also have a bad epistemology when it comes to assessing resurrection evidence -- I could have never have guessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James:  Well, this is the dangers of propagating bad epistemology. I've said that it leaks over into other areas, and I've been talking about this for years, and I think that the coronavirus has given us a really good example of that. How crappy ways of thinking about some things can lead you down to really harmful results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamil:  there is this counter-apologetic, which I think it was worth mentioning. If you assume that in the Book of Acts is literally what happened to history, then why is it the case that there wasn't any manhunt for? There wasn't any question about what actually happens to the body, right? Because is there was a body missing, which would mean for non-Christians at the time that either Jesus wasn't really crucified, which means he's an escaped convict or that he actually died and someone stole the body, which was a criminal offense under both the Jewish and the Roman law. So why is it the case that there wasn't any investigation done about what actually happened to him? I'd like, I think, if something like that happened in history, and if it's the case that Peter was, for example, arrested as a known associate with of Jesus, I think he would be investigated as a suspect in body death. Right? But that's not what's depicted in the book of Acts. It's actually interesting if you read the book of Acts,  it almost proceeds as if the empty tomb didn't exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pauls-conversion"&gt;Paul's Conversion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James: So we know that Paul converted, but we don't really know much more than that. And the account that's given in Acts doesn't really find much corroboration in Paul's actual letters, which itself is odd. Like, you would've thought he would talk about that more. I suppose you could say, Well, that's an argument from silence, but they use that when it suits them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nathan: "we shall place no weight on the experience of the companions" Wouldn't discrepancies be evident, like shouldn't we take that into account when we're trying to assess the evidence for it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian: So we have the posterior ratio there on the left, the probability the resurrection given all the facts compared to probability of not resurrection, given all the facts. And then we have the prior ratio, which they ignore. They carry it around for a little while, then they get to drop it and then we have the likelihood ratio. So the likelihood is generally like assuming your model is true. What was the probability of the various facts? And that's that that term is what we call the likelihood. It's that first thing they're writing down is a likelihood ratio. And if you're ignoring or if you basically say that priors are equal. That's another way to do it.  If the priors are equal  then the posterior ratio is the same as a likelihood ratio, but they're just essentially ignoring the priors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian: Most of those techniques, things like the AIC and the BIC, are approximations of the full analysis where you have a model that has some flexibility to it, so you have models that have a range of parameters, and what you do is sum over all of the different parameters weighted by the prior probabilities of those of those parameter values.  And what you get kind of automatically is a penalty for more parameters that doesn't increase your fit and they're sometimes called the Occam factors.  And it's also why they talk about simplicity in a model. And simplicity doesn't have to do with the number of parameters or the number of components, it has to do with how flexible your model is and  what kind of range of values that it can have. So this is one of the things I comment on in my writings is that theists will often talk about the concept of God being simple because they only have very few components -- just one word. But complexity has to do with flexibility.   Because God can do anything at all that it's infinitely flexible and would receive essentially an infinite penalty -- probability would be near zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James:  All they're doing is multiplying a few numbers together, which they just sort of say, we're just going to assume they're independent because they don't really have any other way of dealing with it. So although they talk about Bayes as  a methodology, they're not really using any of those tools that Brian was just talking about, which is one of the reasons why I've said before that they could just jettison these equations  they wouldn't really lose anything.  It's dressing things up in the trappings of a probabilistic theory that gives it the veneer of scholarship that it doesn't genuinely have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian: I think there's that there's almost a psychological value in making things complex enough that no one's going to check your work and they'll just take your word for it because it's too detailed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James:  This summarizes the key terms here. So  are there is a resurrection hypothesis. So those are actually our priors, which remember they're kind of not actually interested in. But then we've got &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(W\)&lt;/span&gt; given &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(R\)&lt;/span&gt; over &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(W\)&lt;/span&gt; given not &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(R\)&lt;/span&gt;. So that's the women's testimony, right in the empty tomb. As Brian said, they sort of stick around for a bit and then kind of disappear and. But I mean, they're writing the full posteriors here. It's unclear why, because they're not actually addressing that.  Well, the second three terms are different parts of the likelihood. So they've been split up because they're assumed to be independent of each other, which as I'll comment on, this doesn't make that doesn't make any sense, but just to explain the terms.  So again, it's the women, the disciples and then Paul.  They are claiming here that they are all independent of each other, conditioning on the resurrection. So that amounts to the claim that given the women found the tomb empty and reported it, it is no more or less likely that the disciples would see Jesus, that they are independent of each other, right? Does that seem reasonable to anyone else because that seems completely ridiculous to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pasted image 20220710140514.png" src="https://bblais.github.io/images/Pasted image 20220710140514.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James:  How does it follow from the resurrection that women would find the empty tomb?  How does it follow that there would be an empty tomb, I'm not even sure that that follows from there being a resurrection. Could there be a resurrection and the tomb be lost or the tomb be taken up into heaven? Or even there could still be a body in the tomb, or just appears to be a body, I don't know, it's God, can't he do that if he wanted to? Already, I don't agree. Or they just find Jesus alive in the tomb. Yeah, that that's another possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pasted image 20220710140903.png" src="https://bblais.github.io/images/Pasted image 20220710140903.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James:  I thought we were not looking at prior probabilities, but now we are. This is what I mean. They do this &lt;em&gt;repeatedly&lt;/em&gt;.  I could say we can set aside the possibility of a resurrection because that has prohibitively low prior probability, but I guess that's question begging, and they're just looking at the likelihoods. But then they say exactly the same thing against the skeptic. It's unbelievable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James:  So we just get a whole bunch of assertions that the probability is low, like this is what I mean, this is consistently what these sections are about. It's them saying that it's implausible without actually giving really good or in some cases, any reason for actually thinking that it's not a good explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pasted image 20220710142442.png" src="https://bblais.github.io/images/Pasted image 20220710142442.png"&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James:  "is very difficult to see why Joseph of Arimathea would care enough about what happened to Jesus' body to provide his own new tomb for it immediately after Jesus' death, but then would want to move it out as quickly as possible after the Sabbath"  Interestingly, then, at the end, here we get precisely an explanation for that.  So the hypothesis that I was  novel to me that I discuss is that Joseph was prevailed upon by perhaps the Jewish authorities, or perhaps even the Romans who knows exactly, to temporarily store the body in his tomb because it was close by and it needed to be taken down on the Sabbath evening. That was part of Jewish law, and also because the Romans really didn't want Jesus's body to be disposed of in a public place where that there could be continual disorder. They wanted it to be put somewhere that was quiet and out of the way and private until things died down and then after the Sabbath, they could be moved. And I don't really think we get much here about why that is so implausible here. We're &lt;em&gt;told&lt;/em&gt; it is implausible multiple times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamil:  And Bart Ehrman says, OK, I don't know. I'm just going to make up something out of the blue. He didn't do any preparation. He just said, OK, let's assume that the relatives of Joseph of Arimathea who were not followers of Jesus actually found out that he was buried in the family tomb. They were really outraged. They didn't tell anyone that they have a problem with it. So they just decided to go to the tomb at night, take the body and bury it somewhere else. They were stopped by the Roman guards. They were all killed for body theft. And the three bodies were like, disposed of.  They were just thrown in a ditch. Nobody ever finds out. So this explains why the information wasn't then disseminated because everyone involved was killed. And the Roman guards didn't have any reason to tell anyone about it. Or even if, like days later, they heard about someone making it a Resurrection claim, they would have no reason to tie that experience with that specific claim. And he says, Do I think this really happened? No. Is it very probable? No. But it's more probable than resurrection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nathan: Am I just meant to sort of consult my intuitions about them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James: Well, no, because your intuitions could be quite different to theirs, they are just saying that that is their estimate? Right? There's no model here.  You can't really interrogate anything.  All you can say is given what they have said, do you agree with their assessment of 1 out of 100 roughly? And if you don't, well, then they say, well, there's nothing that they can say, or they can just say as they deplore your judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamil:  This is exactly one of the issues with, for example, Richard Carrier.  He gives the reasons for why he thinks that the the expected us of the evidence goes in either direction, for example, that this piece of evidence is what expected on historicity versus mysticism.  I cannot give this like a lower or higher estimate, than, let's say one in two in favor of historicity.  And the and then repeatedly throughout the book, he says, Well, if you have a different estimate, then feel free to publish your own like a work showing why the estimate should be different.  But the obvious issue is that the reasons why he gave gives at most point to in which direction the ratio should go, whether it should favor one hypothesis or the other. But there is no connection between the arguments and the evidence that he presents and the actual numerical value that he then gives. So one in three is just as arbitrary as one in five or one in 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian: You would think that in some cases, you might be able to have some kind of reasonable bounds.  If you're talking about a rare event of some kind then you know an upper bound of like one third might not be outrageous  -- it has to be less than half because we know that the event is somewhat rare, then conservatively you could do one third. And then there's going to be of a lower bound in terms of your ability to even estimate. And so you could follow through Bayes theorem with ranges to posterior ranges as well. They won't be very particularly narrow, but I could see one being able to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James:  So the fundamental problem here, as I mentioned before from my point of view, is that they are using the idea of Bayesianism in terms of subjective degrees of probabilities, multiplying probabilities together and so forth. But then that's all they've done. So in doing that, they can describe &lt;em&gt;their own&lt;/em&gt; degrees of belief. And in that sense, it's completely fine for them to just pull numbers out of wherever because they just describing what they believe, right?  And they can multiply those numbers together and get results as long as they're consistent with the probability axioms, that's fine. The question is whether they should have argumentative purchase on someone who doesn't already agree with them. What reasons should I have for accepting their analysis? And in my view, the only way that that's going to work is if they either provide base rates or they do some sort of actual modeling of some process, psychological or sociological, whatever and are able to use that to derive some estimate of some value, which they plug in to the model at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nathan: And this is why I think it's important not to ignore the base rates when it comes to doing something like this, because the base rate is  tethered to reality in a particular kind of way where I can't imagine my way out of it. Whereas it seems that this is entirely predicated on like how plausible, like how a story sort of makes me feel, like how it sits with my intuitions and by how imaginative I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James: this is just to set this up. So one possible explanation that's in the &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\sim R\)&lt;/span&gt; space is that it was they lied about it. They made it up. So that's what they're responding to here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nathan: it's like it's always if they're in a position to know that they were wrong, right? But it's like if they're in a position to know where they could have known they were wrong, then they would have known if they were wrong. But I just don't think that's right. The Muslims who flew into the twin towers, they're in a position in the 1990s to have access to enough information to know that the Koran, you know, like Koranic studies and like the metaphysics and all the problems if they're in a position to know that it's that Islam is false. Yet they still flew planes into the buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pasted image 20220712114244.png" src="https://bblais.github.io/images/Pasted image 20220712114244.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James: So then they talk about the possibility of some of the disciples stole the body, which I actually think is a possibility. They're not maybe that the disciples, but just some of the followers of Jesus stole the body for something similar to what Kamil said, but maybe for slightly different reasons. I don't see what's so implausible about that, but again, they kind of don't like that, but I don't think we can belabor that point there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pasted image 20220712114433.png" src="https://bblais.github.io/images/Pasted image 20220712114433.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James:  Now again, they don't explain why this is so bizarre. Is it more bizarre that someone had a twin brother who pretended to be them deliberately or maybe even kind of accidentally, or a man came back from the dead?  Which is more bizarre?  So they're also talking about priors there. Again, they keep going back to priors whenever it's convenient for the McGrews. What they're supposed to be addressing is the Bayes factor, which is the ratio of likelihoods, which has nothing to do with how plausible an explanation is. That's the prior. They can't seem to keep that straight in this analysis here. And also, they don't even do a good job explaining why things like that are implausible. They just say it's bizarre, so barely worth mentioning. Why is it bizarre? I mean, maybe it's a little unusual, but then isn't a resurrection bizarre in that sense as well? Why is that more bizarre than a resurrection?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian: So it really is amazing that  &lt;em&gt;every single one&lt;/em&gt; of their critiques of ideas that they disagree with, they argue against the prior and they don't talk about how well that particular explanation, regardless of how likely it is or how likely prior to the data, but how well it explains the observation. They just say, Oh yeah, this is just implausible. Every single one. And why is it OK for them to do that and it's not okay for the skeptic to do that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamil: It would be really interesting to ask them how to explain Jesus appearing in Christian literature, which they don't take as historically reliable.  For example, the Gospel of Peter. How would you explain it, like how is it the case that there is a gospel which explains the appearances of Jesus, which didn't actually take place in history?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian: The probability of a singing cross is high on the resurrection hypothesis and lower than not resurrection hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James:  I will never understand how an apologist can, on the one hand, say if God can create the universe and fine tune the constants, then a resurrection is child's play, which I've heard them say. And on the other hand, laugh and scoff with the audience at the idea of a singing cross. Why is that implausible if God wanted to do that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="on-mistaken-beliefs"&gt;On mistaken beliefs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pasted image 20220712115432.png" src="https://bblais.github.io/images/Pasted image 20220712115432.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamil:  All you need is a sincerely held but mistaken belief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James: Apparently that's not enough because that's what they're arguing here. So they compare it to the idea of religious zealots. Now, I'm not sure why the disciples don't count as religious zealots. By most standards, I think that they would count as religious zealots. Obviously, they're not going to like that language, right? But again, this is just loaded language that they don't define what what the criteria are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pasted image 20220712115619.png" src="https://bblais.github.io/images/Pasted image 20220712115619.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James:  But anyway, they talk about a gambler in a fit of frenzy may offer 100 to 1 odds that the roulette wheel will come up red, but the gambler is apt to sober up quickly and abandon his enthusiasm if his child's life is put on the line. What evidence is there for this? Like people never lose their house because of gambling? That just doesn't happen according to them.  Nathan: Oh, don't fly planes into the twin towers. James: It's just unbelievable. Like, where did they get this stuff from? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James: let's take it seriously. Their claim is that people in a state of religious frenzy or similar to that, whose judgment is clouded, sober up and think more carefully and critically when the stakes are high on the line and therefore unlikely to make those sort of mistakes. What is the evidence for that claim?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nathan: Well, I think the evidence is is exactly the opposite.  When these stakes become so high, there's like a sunk cost fallacy involved in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamil: I think the underlying assumption here, which I think is false, is that if someone believes something very strongly, it must be because they have very good reasons for it. And if they didn't have very good reasons for it that they wouldn't believe it, that strongly. But I think if anything in our background knowledge, it's the knowledge that this is not how people work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pasted image 20220712120337.png" src="https://bblais.github.io/images/Pasted image 20220712120337.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James: Yes, and the McGrews kind of anticipate this objection because they say in the next paragraph, it is sometimes urged that kamikaze pilot suicide bombers and Nazis are willing to give up their lives for what they believe to be true. So that's a sort of a subset of what we were talking about. What is their response to that? The answer is that this description blurs the distinction between the willingness to die for an ideology and the willingness to die in attestation of for a fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nathan: that's just begging the question!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James: But what they believed was a fact, I suppose. But what is an ideology other than facts that you believe, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nathan: Yeah, they're assuming that the conclusion that they want falls under the realm of facts, which is the very thing that the Bayesian analysis is supposed to be establishing, right? We haven't actually established that it is a fact. You can't appeal to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James:  What do you think that if you ask the disciples, are you willing to die or are you facing persecution because of your belief that Jesus died and died for your sins and all that, or because of the empirical fact that you believe you witnessed Jesus rise? Do you think that they would even understand the distinction you were trying to make with this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James:  The Nazi examples [...] so many people attested to the charisma of Hitler and his success empirically like, look at all what he did for Germany in recovering territories and building up the country -- those were empirical facts to them that they attested to, that supported their worldview of that Hitler, which they actually believed, was sort of ordained by Providence.     The point there is, I think that there absolutely are empirical facts that they would have pointed to in defense of or in justification of their views. And likewise, the disciples, I think, would have had empirical facts that I would have wanted to, but also that fits in a big ideology.  What the McGrews are going to do is just artificially distinguish, separate those things and say that it's if you're willing to die for an ideology that doesn't really count for anything. That doesn't mean you're likely to rationally critique it.  But if you're willing to die for any empirical fact, then you're going to rationally critique it and you're going to end it. You must have good reasons. There is no justification for that distinction. It's not clear that the distinction makes any sense at all. And it's not clear that it separates the cases that they want to, because I think that it would be both of it would be ideology and empirical facts. In all of the cases, they're just making things up. They're just making things up that sound the slightest bit plausible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;An "undesigned coincidence" is used in an argument for the reliability of the Gospels, notable by Jonathan McLatchie, Tim McGrew and Lydia McGrew, and &lt;a href="https://jonathanmclatchie.com/yes-richard-carrier-there-are-undesigned-coincidences-part-1/"&gt;is defined as&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have multiple (at least two) accounts that report an event where one account answers in passing a natural question raised incidentally by the other.  Such features are &lt;em&gt;evidence&lt;/em&gt; that a real event lies behind the reports found in the gospels — that is to say, the presence of an undesigned coincidence is more probable given the hypothesis of historicism than given the annulment of that hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I am exploring an "undesigned coincidence" &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/8BQDcl7nOX8?t=2880"&gt;as described by Lydia McGrew&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the grass being green mentioned in Mark at the time, and it's Passover time mentioned in John, and each of these is mentioned only in one Gospel.  This fits together because the grass would be green around that time in Galilee.  So an ur-source theory would be that there would be one source, not reality, that mentioned both that the grass was green and that it was Passover time.  And that John just put down part of that and Mark just put down part of that, but it all came from this sort-of thing which was some version of the story that had both details in it.  What Jonathan means about simplicity is basically what you've done is taken a hypothetical source and given it the properties of reality, and put it up there instead of reality and you have space between that and the alleged hypothetical source and reality where it could be false -- the source might or might not be telling the truth.  Whereas if we just  attribute these characteristics -- the grass and the time of year -- to reality it is simpler than attributing them to this lost documentary source.  And then as he was also pointing out we have apparent discrepancies between the different accounts of the feeding of the 5000 which doesn't fit at all well with the idea of a lost source that by-jove looks like reality and people just took different parts of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tracking this description &lt;a href="https://christian-apologist.com/2022/07/02/undesigned-coincidences-in-the-feeding-of-the-5000/"&gt;a little bit more&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Mark 6:30-43, we learn that the crowd sat down on “green” grass and in John, we learn there was “much grass.” In John 6:1-14, we learn the event took place when the Passover was at hand.
The green grass corroborates the timing because the event likely took place during Israel’s rainy season, which runs from October through April. During the Passover in April, the grass would be abundant and green as it had been raining for months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The argument seems to be that because Mark mentions green grass (which doesn't add to the plot of the story) and John mentions Passover and some grass, that the best explanation of this overlap is that the miraculous event of the feeding of the 5000 actually happened.  Further that an "ur-source" which has both green grass and Passover is less likely, because we then have to posit the existence of a text or oral tradition that we don't have direct access to.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am always supremely underwhelmed with these so-called coincidences, every time I've been presented with them -- they really do seem strained.  For example, here are a few possibilities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both the authors of Mark and John were there, noted the grass and Passover, and wrote their accounts from the shared experience (McGrew's theory)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There was a text or oral story which mentions both the green grass and the Passover&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There was a story (oral or written) that just had Passover, and no grass, and through the process of oral tradition people added the grass (green or unstated) to make the story a bit more interesting.  Note that this would be really easy, even if the event was an entire fiction, because those would know that Passover was typically green so adding that flourish would be natural.  It's like adding snow to a Christmas story (in the US at least) even if the original story doesn't mention snow.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There was a story where there was grass (no color given) and that it was Passover, and Mark adds the color as a literary flourish and doesn't mention the time because it was not important for that story&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There was a story about sitting on the green grass, and John (or his source) adds the particular festival for theological reasons, that Mark didn't seem to have.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The McGrews seem to think that the "ur-source" is positing a specific text that exists, rather than a process which produces texts.  It is not the simplest idea to say that the events happened as stated, when we have other reasons to doubt them (e.g. miracles are unlikely) when we also have many known processes which could produce them, both with and without a separate text or oral tradition.  I could probably envision several other possibilities for this "coincidence", but the point seems to be,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We don't know the authors of any of the Gospels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We don't know the details of the process by which they got their information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We &lt;em&gt;do know&lt;/em&gt; that several of them had copies of at least some of the direct texts, in addition to who-knows how many other sources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We &lt;em&gt;do know&lt;/em&gt; that there is strong indication that some of the Gospel writing was included for &lt;em&gt;theological&lt;/em&gt;  or &lt;em&gt;literary&lt;/em&gt; reasons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The actual posited coincidences are pretty weak. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last point needs a bit of unpacking.  The rainy season is stated to go from October through April, which is more than half the year.  If you included a story that had green grass, you'd be correct about the "time of year" more than 50% of the time.  John, in his story, doesn't seem to mention Passover directly.  In John 2:13 he mentions "When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover" and then between that and the grass incident, we have phrases like (emphasis mine) John 3:22 "where he spent &lt;strong&gt;some time&lt;/strong&gt; with them".  Then John 5:1 "&lt;strong&gt;Some time later&lt;/strong&gt;, Jesus went up to Jerusalem for one of the Jewish festivals." then John 6:1 we have "&lt;strong&gt;Some time after this&lt;/strong&gt;," before the feeding.  So, for the McGrews if the "undesigned coincidence" works in their favor, they can say there is an overlap.   If it didn't, then it probably wouldn't be noticed.  But even if noticed, it can be plausibly denied given the lack of specificity in the time on both sides of the story.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone who is convinced by these two passages as an "undesigned coincidence" I would be skeptical of many of their claims.  I don't have time nor the expertise to go through each and every one of the so-called "coincidences", but they all strike me initially as being completely -- and trivially -- understood as being produced by a common process and are not strong evidence that the events actually happened.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A larger point also, is that even if there is agreement on the time of year, or even specifically a day of an event,  that doesn't mean that the events actually occurred on that day -- it only implies that the &lt;em&gt;story&lt;/em&gt; occurs on that day.  It makes sense that Passover would appear importantly in many stories, both real and fictional, so "coincidences" which tie a story to that day do not say much about whether they are true or not. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="religion"></category></entry><entry><title>Sometimes more testimony is worse.</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2022/Jun/14/sometimes-more-testimony-is-worse/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-06-14T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2022-06-14T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2022-06-14:/posts/2022/Jun/14/sometimes-more-testimony-is-worse/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;When asked the question raised by McLatchie, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pasted image 20220614074246.png" src="https://bblais.github.io/images/Pasted image 20220614074246.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would have to say that new testimony does not raise my probability for a miracle, mostly because all prior attempts to do so have been debunked or at best shown to be profoundly unreliable.   This lowers my credence in the sources, even if I don't have time to investigate in detail the next new claim.  Am I being hyper-skeptical?  I don't think so -- I'm simply adjusting my beliefs to the evidence, and that evidence is that miracle claims have not met their burden of proof.  How could this problem be addressed for me?   In modern settings, having randomized-controlled studies of miracles would be the best  -- because those claims that use this process have shown themselves to be reliable, and thus &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(a\rightarrow 0\)&lt;/span&gt; in the model described below.  Given modern miracle claims, and their issues, I don't think that any ancient source could convince me of miracles -- their reliability on matters of the physical, chemical, and biological world has been shown to be terrible, thus &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(a\rightarrow 1\)&lt;/span&gt; in the model below.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this model is a simplification, it is useful to see that the adjustment of probabilities needs to be taken with care and that unintuitive and non-monotonic effects can easily occur (you can see another non-monotonic effect with the high-low-nines deck example &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2022/Jan/18/bad-apologetics/"&gt;shown here&lt;/a&gt;).  Even if for a single data point, the probability of a model increases, the same can't be said of an accumulation of data points unless one is sure that all of the simplifying assumptions are correct -- and they never are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to Paulogia's tweet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pasted image 20220614074210.png" src="https://bblais.github.io/images/Pasted image 20220614074210.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonathan McLatchie has a reply that got me thinking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pasted image 20220614074246.png" src="https://bblais.github.io/images/Pasted image 20220614074246.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It relates to an idea about testimonies I've heard around, but &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/GH11Ur8cjwM?t=931"&gt;clearly stated by Timothy McGrew&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pasted image 20220614073547.png" src="https://bblais.github.io/images/Pasted image 20220614073547.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the Math Means - A sufficient number of &lt;em&gt;independent&lt;/em&gt; testimonies, each of which has &lt;em&gt;at least a certain minimum amount of force&lt;/em&gt;, will overcome any finite presumption against a miracle.  Hume's "everlasting check" fails; a cumulative case can, in principle, make any miracle claim credible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a mathematical fact that if we have all of the following...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;several data points, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(D_1, D_2, \ldots, D_n\)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for each, the probability of the miracle, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(M\)&lt;/span&gt;, is greater than it's negation, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\bar{M}\)&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(M|D_i)/P(\bar{M}|D_i)&amp;gt;1\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the data are logically independent, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(D_i|M,D_j)=P(D_i|M)\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then we can look at the posterior odds for the miracle,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$
\begin{aligned}
 O &amp;amp;\equiv \frac{P(M|D_1, D_2, \ldots, D_n)}{P(\bar{M}|D_1, D_2, \ldots, D_n)} \\
 &amp;amp;=\frac{P(D_1, D_2, \ldots, D_n|M)P(M)}{P(D_1, D_2, \ldots, D_n|\bar{M})P(\bar{M})} \\
 &amp;amp;=\underbrace{\frac{P(D_1|M)\cdot P(D_2|M) \cdots P(D_n|M)}{P(D_1|\bar{M})\cdot P(D_2|\bar{M}) \cdots P(D_n|\bar{M})}}_{\text{cumulative testimony}}\times \underbrace{\frac{P(M)}{P(\bar{M})}}_{\text{prior odds}} \\
 \end{aligned}
$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
and the cumulative testimony can, in principle (for sufficiently large &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(n\)&lt;/span&gt;), overwhelm &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; small prior odds.  The McGrews use this fact in their article &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781444308334.ch11"&gt;The Argument from Miracles: A Cumulative Case for the Resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth&lt;/a&gt;, but definitely check out the &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2021/Aug/29/bad-apologetics-ep-18-bayes-machine-goes-brrrrrrrrr/"&gt;9-hour analysis of the problems with this article&lt;/a&gt;.  (&lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2022/Mar/30/bad-apologetics-on-bayes-part-1/"&gt;Part 1 of a summary can be found here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typical (and perfectly reasonable) responses to this are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the independence of the data are not established&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the data themselves are not what are often claimed -- the McGrews will often say that, for example, a data point is &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(D_W = \text{the women found the tomb}\)&lt;/span&gt; when in fact that data point should be &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(D_{TW} = \text{there is a text that says that the women found the tomb}\)&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the priors are overestimated, or ignored, and the likelihoods are overestimated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is no way to corroborate the data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I want to explore point 2 above, that we do not have a claim itself, but instead we have someone &lt;em&gt;making&lt;/em&gt; a claim.  This provides one extra level of indirectness to the evidence.  I want to discuss this, because I think this fact alone accounts for most of my own reticence in accepting extraordinary claims, why the methods of science work so well, and seems to show a naïveté in the apologists use of evidence.   I also think this point is rarely addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="setting-up-the-problem"&gt;Setting up the problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/etj.html"&gt;E.T. Jaynes&lt;/a&gt; book on &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Probability-Theory-Science-T-Jaynes/dp/0521592712"&gt;Probability Theory&lt;/a&gt; in Chapter 5 on peculiar uses of probability theory, he explores the idea of diverging probability assignments due to ones perspective on the source of the information.  This idea motivated my particular approach here.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have the proposition, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(M\equiv \text{a miracle occurred}\)&lt;/span&gt;, for which we have a prior, 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$\begin{aligned}
P(M) &amp;amp;\equiv m\\
P(\bar{M}) &amp;amp;\equiv 1-m\\
\end{aligned}$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Note, that for &lt;em&gt;miracle&lt;/em&gt; here you can substitute any extraordinary claim.  Our data consists not of extraordinary observations of the world but of a series of &lt;em&gt;claims&lt;/em&gt; about such observations.  This can include sources such as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;statements from people who made the observations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;texts, in this case ancient texts, which include the claims&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;second- and third-hand accounts of observations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the sake of concreteness, I'll say that the data is &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(C \equiv \text{person X has made a claim of } M\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the sake of charity, we will assume that if a miracle has occurred, then the person would make that claim with certainty, 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$
P(C|M)=1
$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Also for charity, we will ignore data that we'd expect under &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(M\)&lt;/span&gt; but do not observe.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the miracle did not occur, we might expect someone to make the claim that there was a miracle anyway.  This could be from a simple mistake, someone who interprets the world, in general, in terms of divine-action (e.g. rain is caused by the Gods, etc...).  It could be from outright lying.  It could be from lack of proper observational controls, or lack of information.  Any of these could lead someone to make a claim of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(M\)&lt;/span&gt; even if its negation, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\bar{M}\)&lt;/span&gt;, is actually true.  I simplify this to some constant probability,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$
P(C|\bar{M})=a
$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We can now write down with this simple model, the probability of a miracle given this data,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$
\begin{aligned}
P(M|C) &amp;amp;= \frac{P(D|M)P(M)}{P(D|M)P(M)+P(D|\bar{M})P(\bar{M})} \\
&amp;amp;=\frac{1\cdot m}{1\cdot m + a\cdot (1-m)} = \frac{m}{m+a\cdot(1-m)}
\end{aligned}
$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It's good to pause to see if this form makes sense.  If &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(a=0\)&lt;/span&gt;, which means that if there is no miracle, person &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(X\)&lt;/span&gt; will never make the claim that there is one.  This leads to &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(M|C)_{a=0} = 1\)&lt;/span&gt; which is what is expected -- the claim of a miracle can't be mistaken.   What if person &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(X\)&lt;/span&gt; always reports a miracle, even if there isn't one?  In that case &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(a=1\)&lt;/span&gt; and we get &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(M|C)_{a=1} = m\)&lt;/span&gt; which is our prior probability for a miracle.  Essentially, this person with &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(a=1\)&lt;/span&gt; gives no useful information -- they are the proverbial boy who cried miracle.  No new information means that our probabilities do not change and we are left with our original prior probability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can think of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(a\)&lt;/span&gt; as a measure of the reliability (or rather unreliability) of the source, with &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(a=0\)&lt;/span&gt; being completely reliable and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(a=1\)&lt;/span&gt; being (nearly) unreliable.  I say "nearly" because we are still assuming that person &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(X\)&lt;/span&gt; reliably communicates a miracle if it does occur.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing to note about our charitable choices in this model is that that the probability can never go lower than the initial prior.  This is clearly wrong, because one can potentially have disconfirming evidence for a miracle, but we are not considering this here.  Thus, at the outset, this model has a pro-miracle bias built in.  Even with this bias it will become clear how we can counter miracle claims by exploring the scientific process in a bit more detail below.  First, we reproduce the McGrew observation above using this model, by accumulating multiple independent claims, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(C_0, C_1, C_2, \ldots, C_n\)&lt;/span&gt;.  Following the process above (&lt;a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=w%3Dm%2F%28m%2Ba*%281-m%29%29%3B+x%3Dw%2F%28w%2Ba*%281-w%29%29%3B+y%3Dx%2F%28x%2Ba*%281-x%29%29%3B+z%3Dy%2F%28y%2Ba*%281-y%29%29%3B+"&gt;checking with WolframAlpha&lt;/a&gt;) we get&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$
\begin{aligned}
P(M|C_0, C_1, C_2, \ldots, C_n) &amp;amp;= \frac{m}{m+a^n\cdot(1-m)}
\end{aligned}
$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A couple of examples would look like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pasted image 20220614091756.png" src="https://bblais.github.io/images/Pasted image 20220614091756.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can show that, with a high enough &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(n\)&lt;/span&gt;, even a very low prior (&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(m \ll 1\)&lt;/span&gt;) and a really unreliable source (&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(a \sim 1\)&lt;/span&gt;) you can recover the probability of the miracle.  In the example above, I show for a slightly low prior for miracle (&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(m=0.1\)&lt;/span&gt;) and a marginally unreliable source (&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(a=0.8\)&lt;/span&gt;) we recover the probability of a miracle (&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(M|C_0, \ldots, C_n)&amp;gt;0.5\)&lt;/span&gt;) in about 10 data points whereas with a lower prior by a factor of 100 and a more unreliable source, it takes &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(n=66\)&lt;/span&gt; points.   One can question whether the claims-data used to support miracles rise to this number (I don't think it does), but that will not be my main point here.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="enter-the-methods-of-science"&gt;Enter the methods of science&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process of data and model comparison doesn't exist in a vacuum.  It's against a backdrop of science demonstrating that many (all?) of the claims for miracles and most extraordinary claims (e.g. UFOs, alien abductions, homeopathy, etc...) have been shown to be false or at best unsubstantiated.  It is my personal experience that none of the &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/search.html?q=miracles"&gt;miracle claims that have been presented to me&lt;/a&gt; withstand even the slightest level of scrutiny.  There's a &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2022/Mar/23/a-long-discussion-about-miracles/"&gt;very long discussion on the best cases here&lt;/a&gt; with the same result -- one problem after another.  How does this affect the model above?   Imagine the following process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Claim 1 &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\rightarrow\)&lt;/span&gt; debunking of Claim 1 &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\rightarrow\)&lt;/span&gt; Claim 2 &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\rightarrow\)&lt;/span&gt; debunking of Claim 2 &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\rightarrow\)&lt;/span&gt; Claim 3 &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\rightarrow\)&lt;/span&gt; debunking of Claim 3 &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\rightarrow \cdots\)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which pretty much describes my personal experience with the evidence for miracles (and most extraordinary claims).  Each time a claim is put up, and I investigate it, I find it lacking -- usually in pretty mundane and straightforward ways.  Either the claim is completely debunked or at a minimum shown to be not reliable.  What this process does is change how &lt;em&gt;reliable&lt;/em&gt; the sources are, so that next time, similar claims might be less likely. In the model, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(a\)&lt;/span&gt; is pushed toward the value of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(1\)&lt;/span&gt; each time a claim is dispensed with.  Mathematically, a simple way to accomplish this is to add to &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(a\)&lt;/span&gt; some fraction, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\gamma\)&lt;/span&gt;, of the remaining distance between &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(1\)&lt;/span&gt; and the current value of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(a\)&lt;/span&gt;.  In this way, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(a\)&lt;/span&gt; is pushed toward &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(1\)&lt;/span&gt; but will never reach or exceed it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$
a \rightarrow a+\gamma\cdot (1-a)
$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
thus the source-reliability, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(a\)&lt;/span&gt;, is no longer a constant but depends on how many (&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(n\)&lt;/span&gt;) claims have been presented (and dispensed with).  We can &lt;a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=a_n%3Da_n-1+%2B+gamma*%281-a_n-1%29"&gt;find &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(a\)&lt;/span&gt; as a function of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(n\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$
a(n) = (a_0 + \gamma -1)\cdot (1-\gamma)^{n-1}+1
$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
where &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(a_0\)&lt;/span&gt; is the initial assessment of the reliability of the source of the claims.  A quick pause to see that this makes sense:  if &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\gamma=0\)&lt;/span&gt; there is no change to the reliability of the claims, and we have our original value &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(a(n)=a_0\)&lt;/span&gt;.  If &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\gamma=1\)&lt;/span&gt; then even after the first claim, the source becomes completely unreliable, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(a=1\)&lt;/span&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new process gives us a messier posterior for the miracle,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$
\begin{aligned}
P(M|C_0, C_1, C_2, \ldots, C_n) &amp;amp;= \frac{m}{m+\left((a_0 + \gamma -1)\cdot (1-\gamma)^{n-1}+1\right)^n\cdot(1-m)}
\end{aligned}
$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But easy to look at numerically,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pasted image 20220614100045.png" src="https://bblais.github.io/images/Pasted image 20220614100045.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see the effect of claims being shown to be unreliable can make further testimony &lt;em&gt;less reliable&lt;/em&gt;, even in a model which has a definitively pro-miracle bias.  One can see in the curves on the left that the initial claims increase the probability of a miracle, but as they get debunked that initial increase in confidence is erased, and further testimony reduces the probability of claims back to the prior. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked the question raised by McLatchie, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pasted image 20220614074246.png" src="https://bblais.github.io/images/Pasted image 20220614074246.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would have to say that new testimony does not raise my probability for a miracle, mostly because all prior attempts to do so have been debunked or at best shown to be profoundly unreliable.   This lowers my credence in the sources, even if I don't have time to investigate in detail the next new claim.  Am I being hyper-skeptical?  I don't think so -- I'm simply adjusting my beliefs to the evidence, and that evidence is that miracle claims have not met their burden of proof.  How could this problem be addressed for me?   In modern settings, having randomized-controlled studies of miracles would be the best  -- because those claims that use this process have shown themselves to be reliable, and thus &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(a\rightarrow 0\)&lt;/span&gt; in the model above.

Even if for a single data point, the probability of a model increases, the same can't be said of an accumulation of data points unless one is sure that the simplifying assumptions are correct -- and they never are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's 9 hours long, but I am only on for the first 7 hours.  This isn't a complete log of everything said, but I tried to include the main points.  I also started with a transcript, and edited it for clarity (e.g. removing ums, and repetition) but there may still be some weird typos from the computer generated transcript that I didn't catch. I will try to quote Nathan, James, Kamil and myself if it comes from the episode.  All other text is mine, commentary either at the time or sometime afterward. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main issues are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ignoring priors because there's no prior probability in their calculation, so they really aren't doing Bayes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;inconsistent use of priors -- when they address naturalistic alternatives they say, this is implausible -- so they do consider priors, but only when it suits them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they don't support the claim that their preferred model (e.g. Yahweh raised Jesus from the dead) actually produces the evidence with the high likelihood&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they don't seriously consider alternatives, either natural or supernatural&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they don't motivate their numbers with comparable rare events, or they would have seen that their calculation of an odds ratio of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(10^{44}\)&lt;/span&gt; is ridiculous&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they uncritically take the claims in the New Testament as the actual data we have, as opposed to the fact that what we have are ancient &lt;em&gt;texts&lt;/em&gt; that contain those claims&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an uncritical view of New Testament documents, and an unprofessional response to traditional scholarship&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/yeCBpO7pSRM?t=229"&gt;Time stamp 3:49&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nathan opens up comparing the methods in this paper to looking at problem about gremlins in ones closet.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nathan: they basically compare the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis against the likelihood of the evidence given "not the hypothesis". And the reason I think that's a problem is because there's a bunch of risky claims like that. You know, the likelihood that there's noise coming from my attic, given that there are gremlins in my attic is like pretty high, right? But. That if you kind of flip that around and make it so what's the likelihood that gremlins are in my closet given that there's noise, it's not actually that high and they don't really seem to look at it that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By looking only at the likelihoods, one might contend that it is highly likely that there are gremlins in my closet given some noise in my closet because&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$
P(\text{noise}|\text{gremlins}) \gg P(\text{noise}|\text{not gremlins})
$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
or the likelihood ratio
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$
\frac{P(\text{noise}|\text{gremlins})}{P(\text{noise}|\text{not gremlins})} \gg 1
$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Essentially, if you ignore priors you can argue the most ridiculous things.  In McGrew's &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7Gv8Fw_fFE&amp;amp;list=WL&amp;amp;index=12"&gt;seminar here&lt;/a&gt; he actually makes that point -- that you need both the priors and the likelihoods.  Too bad he doesn't follow his own advice in this paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/yeCBpO7pSRM?t=297"&gt;Time stamp 4:57&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamil points out that they don't provide alternative explanations, the proposition &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\sim R\equiv\)&lt;/span&gt; "Jesus was not resurrected" is not really fleshed out, so it's hard to say what any of the probabilities are.  Also the proposition &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(R\equiv\)&lt;/span&gt;"Jesus was resurrected" is hard to deal with if you don't specify what that means.  The expectedness of this proposition will depend on our background knowledge, which includes the laws of physics, so if &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(R\)&lt;/span&gt; entails violating those laws or not then you run into problems defining what it means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamil:  it's very difficult to explain  what exactly you expect on hypothesis that Jesus's body didn't obey the laws of physics. If you start specifying it, then you run into the problem of baking the data -- the evidence that you are trying to explain -- into the explanation itself&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/yeCBpO7pSRM?t=496"&gt;Time stamp 8:16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James: And I made this point before that just because Jesus was resurrected, actually nothing follows whatsoever about who Jesus would appear to or let alone that Paul would be appeared to, but we'll come to that, but they don't really discuss this at all.  It's just an assumption the resurrection explains all the facts without even addressing it.  And then in opposition to that, they don't even pick a specific hypothesis or theory. They just talk about everything else, which makes it very hard to actually compare properly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/yeCBpO7pSRM?t=562"&gt;Time stamp 9:22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian: So my first thoughts on this is and we'll see a number of these points coming up, is that I find a lot of commonalities in different arguments that try to use Bayes in this way to support specifically religious arguments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Badly defined propositions, and I think that's what Kamil and James were getting at -- that they don't specify what these propositions actually mean or what they predict. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What I like to call &lt;em&gt;lack of imagination&lt;/em&gt;,  and that's basically just not really taking seriously all the various alternatives.  There is the denominator where you're simply dividing by all the different alternatives. So if you're not doing all the alternatives, you're going to have inflated probabilities because they should be scaled down the number of plausible alternatives. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They never deal with priors. Well, I'm sure we'll get to that&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The independence assumption, and I'm sure we'll get to that as well. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arbitrary numerical values where we'll see that they just are making up values up off the top of their head without really much justification. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then you can combine all those into a soup that makes a lot of this analysis kind of a mess. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="probability"&gt;Probability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/yeCBpO7pSRM?t=832"&gt;Time stamp 13:52&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James: maybe just to clarify a point there, so in using Bayesian approaches that the McGrews are doing a couple of things here. One is that they are describing their credence -- their degree of belief -- using numbers that have to obey the probability axioms that you mentioned Nathan. So that's fine. That gives a constraint on your reasoning and argumentation. But by itself, it's not actually clear what argumentative value that's going to have. So for example, if I say I hold the credence of 99.99 the God raise Jesus from the dead. And I could even go off and then calculate all the things from that by combining with other probabilities. That in itself doesn't actually tell you anything about what you should believe. I've just described my own subjective beliefs. That's what Bayesian reasoning involves -- it is understanding probabilities as descriptions of credence, as degrees of belief. So I think that there's  an issue in saying all they just making up the numbers, it's actually OK for them to just pull the numbers out of wherever if they're just describing their own degrees of belief, right?   But the question becomes, should I take that seriously? Do those numbers mean anything to me, or should I update my answers on the basis of those numbers? And if they're going to make that argument, they need to give us a reason as to why I, who, you know, have a different set of beliefs and different evidences that I should take those numbers seriously. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/yeCBpO7pSRM?t=1041"&gt;Time stamp 17:21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian: So, so my critique about that kind of arbitrary numbers is they don't make really much effort in constraining them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see probability coming from kind of the formalism that E T Jaynes sets out.  He has a set of axioms that that he uses to derive the laws of probability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Degrees of plausibility are represented by real numbers&lt;/strong&gt;. This is a choice of practicality. Perhaps there is some value in probability represented with &lt;em&gt;complex numbers&lt;/em&gt;, but so far no useful generalization has been found to my knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualitative consistency with common sense&lt;/strong&gt;. Specifically, the system must be consistent with standard Boolean logic - the logic of syllogisms and deductive logic. This is not a generic call to "&lt;em&gt;common sense&lt;/em&gt;" to base the system on, but rather the short-hand informal speech that Jaynes likes to use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internal consistency&lt;/strong&gt;. If a conclusion can be reasoned out in more than one way then every possible way must yield the same result.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Propriety&lt;/strong&gt;. We must take into account all of the information provided that is relevant to the question.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Equivalent states consistency&lt;/strong&gt;. Equivalent states of knowledge must be represented by equivalent plausibility assignments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My feeling is that that aside from the kind of quantitative aspects, it gives a nice structure to an argument where you can see where your inference might be coming from and what it might be affected by. You have to list off all your assumptions all at once, and in that way, you put everything out on the table and and someone can say, "Oh, look, this term I disagree with" and it lets you weigh different possibilities. It provides a structure where you can see how any new evidence might affect particular values. And that's where I see the kind of value in this. It's not the specific numbers that you're going to come out with, it is the structure that you use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/yeCBpO7pSRM?t=1194"&gt;Time stamp 19:54&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamil: I perceive it as a really useful tool for structuring thought and for avoiding a lot of the invalid inferences that people make in objective reasoning. And one thing that it does really well is that it solves one of the issues with the argumentation to the best explanation.  In argumentation to the best explanation, usually the idea is that you have a number of criteria of what constitutes a good explanation and that you're going through various competing hypotheses and you are trying to essentially to score them in terms of how well they perform on that criteria. Things like  explanatory power, plausibility, exploratory scope, explanatory value, simplicity and others like that.  But then the issue is it's usually not the case that the hypotheses either fits the criteria or it doesn't. That's usually a degree. So there is a degree to which a hypothesis has plausibility. There's a degree to which a hypothesis has explanatory power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see value in Bayesian reasoning in that it gives you a good method to take these various explanatory virtues into account all at once. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/yeCBpO7pSRM?t=1746"&gt;Time stamp 29:06&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James: I actually don't think the Bayesian approach as much at all to this article, you could get rid of it, and most of it would just be the same.
Kamil: If you watching this and you don't understand Bayesian reasoning, first of all, you apparently are not smart enough to get saved and go to heaven, but also that doesn't doesn't really matter.  This is not the most technical piece of literature. 
Brian: I think mostly because they never really deal with priors, and so once you're not doing half of the equation, then it really doesn't matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in the discussion, James points out that they do use the priors, just inconsistently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hume"&gt;Hume&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/yeCBpO7pSRM?t=1930"&gt;Time stamp 32:10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pasted image 20220325141826.png" src="https://bblais.github.io/images/Pasted image 20220325141826.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James: [on Hume].  I don't think it's trivial now, even if you know, Bayes because people make this mistake all the time.  Like with the the classic studies they do with doctors asking them about what's the probability that someone has the disease, given that they've tested positively when there's a high false positive rate? Doctors consistently ignore the base rate. And I think that you can interpret what [Hume] is saying as you've got to consider your prior &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; your likelihood. And if the prior is really, really low, like for a miracle, then you've got to have really, really strong evidence. You can't just be enamored with what evidence that looks strong if the prior is low. So I don't, even if that's all Hume is saying and that's disputed, I don't think it is a trivial result. I think it's a very important result. And in my opinion, he delivers that in an eloquent and memorable way. So yeah, I don't get the criticism either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/yeCBpO7pSRM?t=2037"&gt;Time stamp 33:57&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamil: I think there is just some weird, like idiosyncratic thing about how apologists argue, and it's that when they are trying to argue against like a body of work in a specific field of science, they always go after the person who first proposed it. Like, there is a lot of people who argue against what Charles Darwin wrote, and they think that if they poke holes in that, they somehow like, dismantle 150 or 200 years of evolutionary biology. The same is every time I see someone critiquing the documentary hypothesis and old testament studies from like a Christian apologists point of view, they always go after Millhouse. Then they don't engage with people who write about it today. And the same goes with Hume, right? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian: I don't like psychologizing these sorts of things, but I think the way theists think in terms of authorities, they see authority giving truth, right? They find it very hard to imagine anyone who just doesn't care about authorities. It's like it doesn't matter what Einstein said, it's just what the equations say that matters. And so attacking Einstein is not going to move us much. But they see it as the truth, the idea tied to the person because that's the way they think. Because that's the way that religions are structured. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="alternative-supernatural-explanations"&gt;Alternative supernatural explanations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/yeCBpO7pSRM?t=2196"&gt;Time stamp 36:36&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img alt="Pasted image 20220325142609.png" src="https://bblais.github.io/images/Pasted image 20220325142609.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nathan: So I think that this is what Brian was talking about in terms of lack of imagination because I can think of a ton of things that might occupy that probability space, right? Other than theism. So I mean, aliens, right? Maybe like juvenile aliens who are just messing around and wanted to like trick these random primates on some planet could  they not do it? And then I do think it is important because within that probability space, the key thing is it might occupy a chunk. And it was interesting because I asked Vi about this, and we both had wildly different like beliefs about this because I thought that theism was maybe like quite a chunky part of that space for myself, but for Vi, it was like quite a bit lower. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian: Every time they say &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(T\)&lt;/span&gt;=Theism, I find I just try to imagine every kind of crazy God that I can imagine -- Stephen Fry's, evil God, Cthulhu -- what's the probability of Jesus getting resurrected under any of those? It's basically zero or Zeus, right? It's because they don't take these seriously, and they've already assigned them really low priors, but they're not going to directly address that. They're just sweeping those under the rug. And so this is exactly what I was talking about in terms of lack of imagination, but also badly defined propositions. Theism isn't well defined which makes it impossible to pin it down in any real way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamil: They start bringing in implicitly assumptions from Christian theism specifically, or from a subset of it, let's say, classical theism. And I think it's much easier for them to get away with it, doing it implicitly because they use "capital G" God, which is normally how the Christian God is written.  This is why I'm personally very careful to always use that name the term Yahweh, because it brings to the attention that we are talking about a specific deity which has specific mythological baggage. We're not just talking about any God. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James: And later on in the article, they actually specifically mention the example of Zeus  resurrecting Jesus. And they basically just dismiss that as saying, "Well, there's no reason that Zeus would have to resurrect Jesus, right? So even if it existed, it wouldn't explain the evidence". My question would be what reason do we have thinking that Zeus has more reason to resurrect Jesus than Yahweh does? It actually seems to me that Yahweh has a lot of reasons to not resurrect Jesus because of the fact that the apologists usually mention that resurrection is supposed to happen at the end of the world, and the Messiah is not supposed to be resurrected, and the prophecies are not fulfilled in the Old Testament that the Jews talk about, whereas none of that seems pertinent to Zeus.  I mean, Zeus does what he wants like, why would he not resurrect Jesus? I mean, he'd just do it for a laugh. You know, Zeus is always causing trouble and mischief, so I don't see why he wouldn't want to resurrect Jesus. Seems that the probability he would resurrect Jesus is higher than the probability that Yahweh would resurrect Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/yeCBpO7pSRM?t=2633"&gt;Time stamp 43:53&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James: so there are actually so many options here, just to summarize, we've got&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zeus and other god&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ghosts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sorcerer &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;aliens&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some unknown natural principle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reincarnation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could just make things up all day about what it could possibly be if we don't have any constraints.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the question is, if we're going to actually do a Bayesian analysis to compare explanations, what non question begging reason do we have for saying that God is more likely to resurrect Jesus than any of the other ones that I just mentioned? I have not heard a clear answer to that question that doesn't already appeal to like a bunch of stuff in the Bible or whatever, which is what I mean by question begging. Why should we accept that? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="explanations"&gt;Explanations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""&gt;Time stamp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamil:  That would circle back to the issue that I mentioned initially of just defining our explanation in terms of the evidence that you're trying to explain. If you have a set of data and all that you're saying in the explanation is that "there are ghosts and they want to produce this sort of data". Now, first of all, there isn't really any constraint about what is a ghost, what it can do. It's really vague it doesn't say much. So it's really difficult to to estimate what's expected on the ghost proposition, right? Which I think is directly analogous to the resurrection because you don't know what is a resurrected body, what kind of properties it has like, does it interact with light? Does light reflect from it back to your eyes so that you can actually see it visually? It does, except when it doesn't, and it has solid substance, except when it doesn't like when he passes through locked doors.  So that's one problem. And the second problem is the ghost that wants to do exactly what the evidence is, right? Well, then you're not explaining you're just restating the data.
James: That's what theists explanations always are.   They say "God just wanted to do this" that's all the explanation is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James: But I think it's actually important to draw this out, that's what you get when you appeal to God's intentions or actions when you're explaining anything because there're no constraints on what God can do, and it's unclear where you get any constraints over what God even would do unless you have some sort of actual theology to appeal to, to say he would do this or would do that. So I think at the end of the day, you just get a list of "God did it" and he did these things right and that just all of the things that are necessary for your data like, Oh, God raised Jesus from the tomb, removing his body from the tomb. And then he appeared to the women so that they saw him and then the disciples, and then he appeared to Paul. That's just basically very close to a list of the data to be explained. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamile: But it's very, very important that when we explain evidence in terms of people having intentions, it's very important to to ask the question how plausible it is that the given people, in the explanation would have the intentions that they are hypothetically hypothesized to have. It's really, really trivial to imagine hypotheses that explain a set of historical data in terms of specific people having specific intentions, which are nevertheless really implausible given our historical background knowledge, or even just given simple things in our background knowledge, such as some general features of human psychology.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a-little-about-priors"&gt;A little about priors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian: One of the points I was thinking of when Nathan put up the form:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$
\frac{P(E|R)}{P(E|\sim\!\! R)}
$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So one of the problems with this is that you can have an explanation that doesn't fit the data quite as well, but it's far more plausible and that will outweigh in a Bayesian sense something that  explains it really well, but it's implausible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$
\frac{P(E|R)P(R)}{P(E|\sim\!\! R)P(\sim\!\! R)}
$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
with &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(E|R)&amp;gt;P(E|\sim\!\! R)\)&lt;/span&gt; (an explanation that doesn't fit the data quite as well as &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(R\)&lt;/span&gt;) but &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(R)\ll P(\sim\!\! R)\)&lt;/span&gt; ( it's far more plausible than &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(R\)&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so by ignoring the priors (&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(R)\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(\sim\!\! R)\)&lt;/span&gt;), which the McGrews do, they   pretty much throw out that entire part. For example, you may think that aliens doesn't explain the data all that well, but they're far more plausible than any kind of spiritual or supernatural explanation.   But then what it does is you then have the argument about priors.  I think this happened in the &lt;a href="https://capturingchristianity.com/cc023-the-historical-case-for-the-resurrection-of-jesus-part-1-of-5/"&gt;conversation with Max Baker-Hitch and Calum Miller&lt;/a&gt; It got to the point where they admitted that the naturalistic explanations were reasonably plausible but then we have to back it up to the evidence for theism directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pasted image 20220326165821.png" src="https://bblais.github.io/images/Pasted image 20220326165821.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James: The point there is that there's no priors there, right? So they're actually just saying that the evidence is confirmatory for the resurrection over, not R. Now what Kamil was saying is that they're ignoring priors, and this is the sense in which they're ignoring priors because there's no prior probability.  However, they are not consistent with this because, and we've already seen an example of this and we'll see it more, when they address naturalistic alternatives they say, this is implausible. Yet they don't say that it wouldn't actually explain the data. They just say it has a low prior, they say low antecedent probability.  So they are completely inconsistent with what they actually do in their argument. So I actually think that they do consider priors, but only when it suits them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamil: what I want to say is that this is an argumentative strategy that you see all the time in papers that use Bayesian reasoning. They will say we are not going to be looking at intrinsic probabilities. We are just going to compare expectedness of evidence.  And the idea behind that is that, first of all, it's really, really difficult to establish probabilities in general. And second of all, the argumentative strategy is very often to show that the likelihood ratio is just so high in favor of one hypothesis that in order to overcome that, we would have to imagine a really, really high difference in the prior.   I think this is perfectly fine if you stated in the paper that this is what you're doing explicitly.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lydia McGrew &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/rtwejTDjPA4"&gt;in a separate video&lt;/a&gt; admits to doing just that -- if you can demonstrate the likelihood ratio is high enough, it can overwhelm any reasonable prior.  So, if they are doing this, then they should state it up front and also never talk about the plausibility of any competing hypothesis because that would be irrelevant to this approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="r-vs-not-r"&gt;&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(R\)&lt;/span&gt; vs not &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(R\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/yeCBpO7pSRM?t=3872"&gt;Time stamp 1:04:32&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James: They've got conditional on &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(R\)&lt;/span&gt;, which is the resurrection hypothesis and then the same evidence, but conditional on not &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(R\)&lt;/span&gt; now. I think that that's a terrible way of trying to do this because I mentioned this before. The way that you would typically do Bayesian model comparison is by comparing one model to another. And when I say model here, I mean, like a theory. So like the resurrection would be a theory. An alternative theory would be something like Camille's explanation or my RHBS model or, you know, different a combination of both. They're not necessarily mutually exclusive, but you consider one model and then compare its explanatory value or, in other words, the probability of the evidence given that explanation and compare that to the resurrection. One trying to compare it to all of the others. I mean, in principle, like so "not &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(R\)&lt;/span&gt;" (&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\sim\!\! R\)&lt;/span&gt;)  would technically include every other explanatory option. But the problem with trying to do that is that it's so unconstrained because it's literally just everything that's not the resurrection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we'll see later, there's actually no constraints on what they can argue against. So they'll pick whatever counterexample that they like, like naturalistic theory for whichever part of that and argue against it when it's convenient. And then when a different one is convenient, they'll argue against that because it's just "not &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(R\)&lt;/span&gt;" like anything will do. And I think that this often leads to inconsistencies  and it gives the impression that there's not really any competing explanation because they're not considering a competing explanation. They just sort of picking from the set of every possible thing that's "not resurrection".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the strengths of Bayesian reasoning is it that it forces you to write down all of your assumptions up front, and all of the models that you're comparing it to.  Unless you truly have only two models, you just don't set it up like
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$
\frac{P(\text{my model})}{P(\text{not my model})}
$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
especially when "my model" is not well constrained, because the terms contain too many parts that you can either sweep under the rug or accidentally overlook because they are lumped into too big blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamil: That's like a general problem in things in a Christian apologetics.  One of their objections against alternative hypotheses is that they don't explain all of the data, they only explain some of the data. But the thing is that very often the explanations are intended to explain exactly some of the data.  They will say we can reject the swoon hypothesis because it doesn't explain the appearances and we can reject the hallucination hypothesis because it doesn't explain the empty tomb.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's why &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/zNVQKUSn00Y"&gt;James's RHBS model&lt;/a&gt; has four parts -- reburial, hallucination, memory biases, and socialization -- because it's likely to be multiple interacting phenomena to explain something as complex as the birth of a new religion.  But if apologists look at it one-by-one, they'd say the hallucination doesn't explain the empty tomb while reburial doesn't explain the appearances, and they'd think they were arguing against the model when in fact they aren't.  They could rightly complain that the conjunction of 4 different things is implausible -- the product of their probabilities would be lower than any individual one -- but each of these is so much more plausible a priori than a resurrection that this is not really an issue.  Every one of those parts concerns phenomena that we know happen, and in some cases (e.g. biases and socialization) happen &lt;em&gt;frequently&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/yeCBpO7pSRM?t=4099"&gt;Time stamp 1:08:19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian:  I find that this way of formulating it  kind of piles a bunch of things into th "not &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(R\)&lt;/span&gt;" part -- and even the "&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(R\)&lt;/span&gt;" part -- that they're not really explicitly doing. 
 Kamile said that they're two important parts of Bayes theorem but I would actually state that there are three.   I &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/3xAb3aVGVM0"&gt;gave a TEDx talk&lt;/a&gt; where I going to try to give an intuitive explanation of the structure of Bayes theorem: a belief in a particular explanation should scale with &lt;em&gt;how well that explanation fits the data&lt;/em&gt; (called the likelihood),  it should also scale with &lt;em&gt;how plausible that explanation was before you saw any data&lt;/em&gt; (the prior), and then the third part is the belief is scaled down by essentially all of the alternatives.  So the problem with the phrasing it in this "&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(R\)&lt;/span&gt; vs "not &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(R\)&lt;/span&gt;" comparison and not breaking it out into all the possibilities is that you end up not being specific about your alternatives of doing things like Kamile said, like ignoring things where an explanation is designed for only  part of the data.  It makes it a lot less constrained. And I think if they broke it out, they would see it would be less constrained. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pasted image 20220327154748.png" src="https://bblais.github.io/images/Pasted image 20220327154748.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="on-the-expectedness-of-r"&gt;On the expectedness of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(R\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/yeCBpO7pSRM?t=4375"&gt;Time stamp 1:12:55&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamil:  So if you are a Christian first and you want to maintain that, it's really, really plausible, given some general considerations like philosophical and theological considerations that a God would want to raise someone like Jesus from the dead. Then it becomes really, really plausible at the same time that someone like Jesus's disciples would conclude that Jesus was actually raised from the dead, even though he wasn't, &lt;em&gt;precisely because&lt;/em&gt; they also had access to those philosophical and theological considerations, right? Like if Swinburne is really correct, that it's very, very plausible  that, for example, someone like Yahweh would want to raise someone like Jesus from the dead, then no wonder that someone like Jesus's disciples were falsely convinced that Jesus was raised because in their mind, it was just so damn plausible, right? So they just formed a false belief based on that high possibility. This is again like a fatal flaw. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, and I think that the problem is exactly that. Christian theists want to have it both ways. They want to say at the same time that the plausibility of the resurrection is really, really high. So we don't really have to worry about that huge difference in plausibility ratios. But at the same time, the evidence that the disciples had access to must have been really good in order to overcome the unexpectedness of something like the resurrection on their existing religious milieu.  But yeah, I think there is a massive tension between those two ideas, either it's plausible -- so it's likely that you would be falsely convinced of it -- or it's implausible -- in which case that is the problem with the prior probability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamil's point is worth pausing and understanding what it means for apologetics for the resurrection.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nathan follows this with exactly the problem with looking at likelihood ratios instead of posterior probabilities.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nathan:  the fact that they're ignoring the base rate rate seems to mean that you kind of lose all of the benefit, in my view, of doing that Bayesian analysis.  That example James gave before of  doctors diagnosing people and the kind of  heuristics that we use. So for example, if you say you've got a positive test for HIV in the UK or something, you might think, "Well, given that I'm a doctor, right? And this person is here presenting with these symptoms and they've got a positive test. And it's that evidence is really, really likely on the hypothesis that they've got HIV vs the hypothesis that they've not got HIV" and it would actually win out, I think, on this analysis. But when you take into account that base rate, which is the number of people with HIV in the UK, which is really, really low like naught point naught naught naught one percent something, then boom. All of a sudden the probability of having HIV given the positive test it's something naught point four or something. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is exactly right.  If you ignore the priors (base-rates) then you can convince yourself of a false claim following our (flawed) intuitions.  The calculation would go as follows.  I use small numbers to make things more intuitive.   The disease is 1 out of 200 in a population of 3000, and we have a test that is 99% accurate.  You test positive, and want to know whether you should think you have the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bayes' Recipe proceeds as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specify the prior probabilities for the models being considered&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our case we have
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$
\begin{aligned}
P(\text{disease}) &amp;amp;= \frac{1}{200}\\
P(\text{no disease}) &amp;amp;= \frac{199}{200}
\end{aligned}
$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
2. Write the top of Bayes' Rule for all models being considered&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "models" in this case really is binary: you either have the disease or you don't. Unlike in the case for the resurrection where there is more than one way to have the model "resurrection" happen and more than one way for "not resurrection" to happen.  The top of Bayes theorem has the likelihood and prior for each model, so we'd have:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$
\begin{aligned}
P(\text{disease}|\text{positive test}) &amp;amp;= P(\text{positive test}|\text{disease})\times P(\text{disease}) \\
P(\text{no disease}|\text{positive test}) &amp;amp;= P(\text{positive test}|\text{no disease})\times P(\text{no disease})
\end{aligned}
$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The likelihood terms come from the test
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$
\begin{aligned}
P(\text{positive test}|\text{disease})&amp;amp;=99\%\\
P(\text{positive test}|\text{no disease})&amp;amp;=1\%
\end{aligned}
$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So the top of Bayes for each model would be
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$
\begin{aligned}
P(\text{disease}|\text{positive test}) &amp;amp;= 0.99\times \frac{1}{200} = 0.005 \\
P(\text{no disease}|\text{positive test}) &amp;amp;= 0.01\times \frac{199}{200} = 0.0099
\end{aligned}
$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add these values for all models&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$
T=0.005 + 0.0099 = 0.0149
$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Divide each of the values by this sum, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(K\)&lt;/span&gt;, to get the final probabilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$
\begin{aligned}
P(\text{disease}|\text{positive test}) &amp;amp;= 0.005/0.0149 = 34\% \\
P(\text{no disease}|\text{positive test}) &amp;amp;= 0.0099/0.0149 = 66\%
\end{aligned}
$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which means that if you have a rare disease, you are very unlikely to have it &lt;em&gt;even given a 99% accurate positive test for it&lt;/em&gt;!  This is a seriously unintuitive result, so it is helpful to visualize it in another way to build your intuition.  One way to see this result is to visualize it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pasted image 20220327183151.png" src="https://bblais.github.io/images/Pasted image 20220327183151.png"&gt;
The disease is 1 out of 200 in a population of 3000, and the test is 99% accurate.  This means about 15 sick people and about 2985 healthy people.  If all of the sick people test positive, and 1% of the healthy people test positive due to the 99% accuracy, we would have 15 sick and 29 healthy people who all test positive.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This effect depends on the rarity of the disease (the more rare, the less likely) and the false positive rate (the number of healthy people who test positive anyway).  This will vary depending on the disease and the test, but can lead to this unintuitive result, and thus can lead one to make poor medical decisions.  It also means that by ignoring priors one opens oneself up to these kinds of errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not earlier that Lydia McGrew &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/rtwejTDjPA4"&gt;in a separate video&lt;/a&gt; justifies ignoring the prior because they supposedly demonstrate that the likelihood ratio is so high as to admit no reasonable prior, even if low.  They don't, however, state that in this paper and they aren't consistent in their approach to priors as &lt;a href="#a-little-about-priors"&gt;James points out earlier&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/yeCBpO7pSRM?t=4585"&gt;Time stamp 1:16:25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamil: Well, I think the this is why we said at the beginning that framing this article in terms of Bayesian reasoning is superficial.  For the reason that you can just take the equations and the Bayesian fluff out.   This is essentially very similar to, for example, of what Mike Licona is doing.  Mike Licona is not a Bayesian.   He goes for good old argumentation to the best explanation.  The conclusion that he gives is that the resurrection hypothesis has much better explanatory scope and explanatory power. But when it comes to plausibility, he says, "A historian cannot, in their professional capacity, evaluate whether miracle took place or not. So I'm just going to leave the plausibility cell in the table of hypothesis virtues empty. So I will be essentially agnostic or undecided about whether the resurrection hypothesis is plausible. And he says, "Look, we have all of these alternative hypotheses that don't have exploratory power, or they don't have explanatory scope or they don't have plausibility. And then that is mine that has explanatory power and explanatory scope but it has not been established that it has low plausibility because I just didn't do anything with plausibility. So that's the best explanation, right?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the obvious objection against that is, if you don't do anything about plausibility and if you're essentially agnostic about whether it's high or low, then you should not say that it's the best explanation. You should say it's unknown whether it's the best explanation or not, because if it's the case that the plausibility is low, then it's a worse explanation and if it's the case that it's high, it's a better explanation.   He doesn't use Bayesian reasoning, but the structure of the argument, I think, is very, very similar. And that just shows how,  superficial the Bayesian approach is here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamll: there's a really interesting interview that I actually did review on Doug's channel, and that's Lydia McGrew having a conversation with AJ Thompson. And in that interview, she says explicitly, "Look, when we started working on this chapter for the Blackwell's companion to natural theology, we realized very quickly  that unless we can establish that the Gospels, were written either, by eyewitnesses themselves or they were sourced by eyewitnesses, then it's actually very, very difficult to establish that this ratio of expectations on the evidence is very high."" Because, obviously, if you believe that there were people in the first century who were sincerely convinced that they lived with the resurrected Jesus for 40 days and that he talked to them, they touched him, they saw him eat fish, etc... Then those kinds of experiences are going to be very, very difficult to explain on the naturalistic hypothesis.  But the naturalist is obviously going to explain those data points, like the contents of Acts 1, as not being people who had those kinds of experiences in history in the first place but by positing that what Acts 1 depicts is a literary creation that does not correspond to anything that happens in history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian: I think this one of the things that becomes clear here, and they could have dealt with this in the Bayesian framework if they wanted to, is what counts as data. So they  have something like a claim that "Jesus ate dinner with the disciples after the three days"  That's the data, or what they are taking as data. Whereas really, the data is we &lt;em&gt;have a written document written 50 or so years later&lt;/em&gt; that has this story. And so it's a claim about that -- a text. And so  you can put that into that formalism if you want to, but that's not what the McGrews are doing.  This sentence in the paper is essentially saying, we're going to ignore the text and just count as data, literally, the claims that are there in the story. And if you're going to do that, you may as well just say, well, then the data is, "they said that Jesus was resurrected" and we're done with this argument. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/yeCBpO7pSRM?t=5696"&gt;Time stamp 1:34:56&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamil: it's definitely the case with Brian said that when apologists read the passage that says that Jesus ate with Jesus with his disciples for 40 days after the resurrection, then the date relevant data is that there were people who experienced Jesus living with them for 40 days, right? Well, actually what the data is that there is a text that says that. And in this case, that's actually only in acts, right? That's not found in any of the documents that would be independent from acts, I think. [...] it's like a two step approach to this specific apologetic where they start. Like the step one is to actually establish that the Gospels and acts are historically reliable so that then (step two) they could treat the passage, saying that Jesus lived with his disciples for forty days as meaning or as implying that there actually were people who experienced that. [...] But the problem with that two step process is that assessing the historic reliability of the documents, I think is itself going to be conditional on the content of the documents specifically on them containing these kinds of miraculous claims, right? Like if you are a historian and you are trying to assess whether a document is historically reliable. One thing that is, I think should be at least somewhat important is evaluating what the document actually says. You cannot be just limited to external considerations like what is the attestation to the authorship by the early church and stuff like that.  You have to actually look at the content of the document. And no historian probably would conclude that an ancient document that contains so many, let's say, fantastical material or material with very low prior probability counts as historically accurate. [...] any historian that finds a text which says that someone walked on water is probably not going to think that the text was actually written by people who were there to see it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James: it's bizarre to say that we can assess the reliability of a text putting aside all of the non-plausible stuff and say, well, there's real places and real people and other stuff mentioned here. So therefore, all of the stuff that seems miraculous or seems to seems implausible or that would count against its reliability just sort of gets a pass.  That isn't, as Kamil says, how historians assess any other document&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James:  I'm not necessarily disagreeing with the fact that the arguments from silence are pretty tenuous. I'm highlighting that because we're going to later that when it suits them, they deploy arguments from silence a lot, arguing against hypotheses that they don't like.  So that's another one just to bear in mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James: Whenever the naturalist or just the skeptic about the resurrection postulates something, you know, Joseph of Arithamathea reburied the body or there were tomb robbers, or that there was a hallucination or whatever it is. They'll say, "Oh, he's got no evidence that that's just ad hoc". And then this is similar to, "oh,  you know, we can't speculate about the intentions of an author". But then they feel free to speculate about what God would want to do about resurrecting Jesus and about setting him to appear to Paul and other things like that. So I mean, what do we have more basis for speculating about -- what people would do or what God would do? It's just seems  entirely inconsistent to me. Plus, no one observed the resurrection. That's an unobserved postulate, right? The point is that the resurrection best explains the data, according to them. So why can't we postulate unobservables that explain the data? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James:How do historians usually react when they find a text which seems to correctly prophesy about an event that occurs in the future? What's the usual inference that's made there? 
Kamil: Well, they say that's amazing because we can actually date at the text really well. We can establish that it must have been written after the fact that it's prophesying took place, right?
Brian: Isn't that circular, though? I'm just trying to take their point here.
James:  So they claim to date the Gospels to before AD 70 on the basis of fulfilled prophecy is just too assume  philosophical naturalism. Now, whether that's true or not, I'm just making the point that they want the text to be treated like other historical text, right? That is how historians would treat any other historical text where there was something like this in it. So which is it? Do they want them to be treated special or do they want it to be treated like any other? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamil: Every single time when we see in ancient literature, these things that look like prophecies actually taking place, like coming true, and we can date the text using independent evidence we &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; find out that it's an accidental prophecy.  [...] based on that background knowledge based on the knowledge that every single time we've seen something like that, it turns out to be an accidental prophecy  from independent evidence. We can establish that this is probably going to be the case as well, right, and that's not a circular. That's not  assuming naturalism, that's not having an anti-supernatural bias. That's taking into account background knowledge, when we assess  evidence for a new claim, which is exactly what Bayesian reasoning is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="trustworthiness-of-the-early-church-tradition"&gt;Trustworthiness of the early church tradition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/yeCBpO7pSRM?t=7853"&gt;Time stamp 2:10:53&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamil: One thing that people don't appreciate about early gospel tradition is that everything that we can actually evaluate, everything that we can actually check about that early tradition turns out to be wrong. So, for example, we can establish it's not the case that the gospel of Matthew was written first, we can establish that the Gospel of Matthew was not originally written in Hebrew -- it was originally written in Greek, even though all of the early Christian authors who comment on that universally say that it was originally written in Hebrew and they believed that probably because it's a very Jewish Gospel in terms of what it says. That led them to believe that it must have been written in Hebrew and there may have been some other reasons -- that it gets complicated. So given that the early church tradition has a really bad track record when it comes to things that we can actually establish, I think that massively lowers our credence. If they get everything else wrong, why should we trust  what they say&amp;gt;
James: What you're telling me, Kamile, is that the early Christian writers didn't know &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; the Gospel of Matthew was written,  &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt; wrote it, &lt;em&gt;what order&lt;/em&gt; It was written relative to the other Gospels, or even what &lt;em&gt;language&lt;/em&gt; it was written in?  But they still knew enough about all of the other details to confirm that it was trustworthy, and that it had eyewitness testimony behind it and all of that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/yeCBpO7pSRM?t=8506"&gt;Time stamp 2:21:46&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pasted image 20220328150405.png" src="https://bblais.github.io/images/Pasted image 20220328150405.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James:  "Our point is not that these discoveries demonstrate the accuracy of all other portions of the Gospels." OK, fair enough. It doesn't. Rather, "it is the common sense principle that the authors who have shown to be accurate in matters that we can check against existing independent evidence deserve within reasonable grounds the benefit of the doubt when they speak of matters of putative public fact that we cannot at present verify." I think that's a completely ridiculous principle because we don't just assume that because there are certain things that people say are accurate, that therefore, you know, probably everything that they say is accurate, like, imagine applying that principle to books of works of fiction. Well, you know, then they go to Paris and visit the Louve. And, you know, as they mentioned, Churchill and World War, you know, those things are accurate. So you know, they must be like, Harry Potter must be real, then.  Just because real places and people are mentioned in Harry Potter doesn't mean that it's real. This seems to be a ridiculous principle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamil: Maybe to disagree a little bit, this principle would definitely hold when it comes to evaluating other ancient texts, especially texts of a historigraphical nature by contemporary historians. So when  historians are trying to assess the reliability of the text of some account, they look for whether the author gets historical details roughly correct in cases where we can actually establish that established independent of the text.  And if it's the case that they do, it's reasonable to believe the other things that they say.  [...] But it's important to realize to at least two considerations  First is that this kind of reasoning is motivated by pragmatic factors more often than not, because it's just the case that we have so little surviving literature from the ancient world, especially solely to surviving historiographical literature of the ancient world that it's just that we have to go with pretty much with what we have because there isn't anything else. And every responsible scholar is going to keep that in mind, and is going to nuance that in the text, in the literature that they are producing. And the second consideration is that we still have to take into consideration the prior or intrinsic probabilities of the claims.   Like if there is a chronicler that describes three battles and two of the battles, we can actually establish were the case from other sources maybe from archeology and stuff like that. But it's reasonable to believe that he also had accurate information about the third battle from a pragmatic point of view. given that we have no other sources from the ancient world about that particular event. [...]  So you wrote about who was elected in what position in that given year,  you wrote about important battles, you wrote about things like plagues, crop failure and stuff like that. But you would also dedicate sections to describing divine moments that were observed by people, by the priests, and they were actually reported to the priests like to the state in official capacity because that's very important because you believe that there are the gods.  [...] Contemporary historians obviously don't think that those divine omens happened, because that is the difference in intrinsic probability. And it's not their behaving like an anti-supernatural bias or assuming naturalism or  being biased against the Roman gods existing or something like that. That's just like doing basic history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/yeCBpO7pSRM?t=9025"&gt;Time stamp 2:30:25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James: If they then write elsewhere about a different event that has no particular connection to the first one, I may not necessarily assume that their account is accurate, especially if in a different place or a different time. The more different it is, basically, the less it seems to fit in the same reference class of things that they could know about, the less I'm going to appeal to that. And so in the case here, what we're talking about is that a certain temple had a certain  number of pillars or that a certain pool existed, and some other types of geographic and political references.  We're supposed to make some inference about that to details about the claims that the disciples made about their experiences. Those two things to me are completely separate from each other. And just because you're reliable about one doesn't really say anything about reliability on another. So that's the sense in which I just don't agree with that principle at all. It's not just an issue of whether it's the same author, it's about how they would have gotten that information and the plausibility of that information and the bias of the author and other factors like that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamil: it's really apparent that when it comes to this specific type of apologetics, Christian apologists often aim at quantity, not necessarily quality, because I think they realize that they're engaging with an audience either Christian or non-Christian that is in no position to evaluate how significant it is for the author to get that particular historical detail.  So they just go with having a lot of them because there is then this implicit  cumulative case.  But if you actually really go into detail one by one, as you are very well informed about  ancient history, you have  a robust background knowledge about that, then you will find more often than not that actually, there is nothing particularly striking about an author who wasn't an eyewitness to the events having access to that detail. 
[...]
You will very often see headlines in apologetic websites saying things like 84 things that the Book of Acts got historically correct and the  implicit inference that you're supposed to draw from that is, look, if it's the case that the author of Acts got 84 things correct then it's reasonable to believe that either he really was an eyewitness to Paul's life or his missionary journeys, or it's reasonable to believe that he also got the fantastical stuff right.  But if you actually look at those 84 things, there are things like there was a temple of Artemis at Ephesus.  Well, no surprise!  It was one of the seven wonders of the ancient world.   If this is actually something that I think almost is an argument against the book of Acts being historically reliable. Because if you imagine an author writing a fictional story taking place in a location that he doesn't really know anything about, the one thing that he's going to be talking about is the one thing that everyone knows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/yeCBpO7pSRM?t=9392"&gt;Time stamp 2:36:32&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James:  There's another issue about base rates.  So what is the base rate of correctly ascribing geographic or political or other details like this in fictional texts? We need to establish that if we're going to make claims about how likely it is that a text is accurate, given that it includes some of those details, you need to know what the base rate is, but that's neglected. And this is one of the points that I've continually made here, that they just pull these things out as if they are relevant. But they haven't actually established that they're relevant by looking at comparisons to texts, texts that we generally agree are not accurate. Well, how often do they include these sorts of details? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/yeCBpO7pSRM?t=9431"&gt;Time stamp 2:37:11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(this is the same clip as above, but Nathan reads from it here too)
&lt;img alt="Pasted image 20220328150405.png" src="https://bblais.github.io/images/Pasted image 20220328150405.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nathan:  "Numerous other discoveries indicate a level of accuracy incompatible with a picture of the development of the gospel as an accretion of legend over the course of two or more generations."  I think there's some ambiguity built into the alternative candidate explanations that they sort of set themselves up against here as well, because the gospels as an accretion of legend over the course of two or more generations could mean multiple things. I think that what they're levying and the kind of argument against is the idea that the thing is sort of almost purely fabricated, whereas I think there are quite a lot stronger versions of that where the scaffolding is actually completely historical but then the theological details are given the psychology of like a Second Temple Jew and type of practices to do with history and figuring out what might have happened and all the emotional details that might have been involved in the psychological makeup as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James:  do they know how much accuracy is incompatible with legendary development? Why wouldn't legends draw upon real places and real things as a way, as a setting for the legends? I'm not saying there were legends but they just make these claims as if they've established some sort of basis,  where they haven't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pasted image 20220329152639.png" src="https://bblais.github.io/images/Pasted image 20220329152639.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/yeCBpO7pSRM?t=10001"&gt;Time stamp 2:46:41&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamil: Because this is this is just a summary of what &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papias_of_Hierapolis"&gt;Papias&lt;/a&gt;.  So if you actually unpack that  the things that we can actually independently check about, those accounts are false.  Matthew wasn't the first written, Papias says it was written in Hebrew, which it wasn't. [...] I think they [the McGrews] have to basically be committed to  those views, even though they are fringe in New Testament scholarship for good reasons. Because alternatively you would have to admit that someone like Papias is wrong about all the things that we can check. But he happens to be right about who wrote it. It's like, you know how in the book of Acts, they want you to say, "Look,  the Book of Acts is reliable about all the things that we can check, so it's reasonable to assume that it's reliable." Well, here it's the other way around -- we can establish that Papias is wrong about all the things that we can check. So why believe him about the things that we can't check, which are exactly what's in question, the authorship?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mention Joseph Francis Burton's &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvRNWFZu_wX6pAYB_eOyFrFSdMDn5R9h2"&gt;excellent series going through Richard Bauchkam's Jesus and the Eyewitnesses&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/oC6lXVp9sNo"&gt;His third video goes through Papias&lt;/a&gt; and the evidence we have.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James: Why do we trust these early Christian authors so much -- they don't really justify this. It's not clear what information that they had. Why did they write what they did? Well, I say why did they wrote the gospels, but also why the early Christian authors who were commenting on the gospels wrote their texts? Were they unbiased? Did they follow modern scholarly practices? These are the sort of things that I've been wanting to know in assessing how trustworthy they are. Not just  did they write soon afterwards, and some of them is not even that soon afterwards.  I just find a total lack of criticism of critical evaluation of the patristic claims and all gospel author claims to be really telling in this section here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamil: This is massively ironic.  They say "imaginary strata in an imaginary source document". Do you know what's also an "imaginary strata in an imaginary source document"?   The pre-Pauline creeds.  We know of the existence of the creeds pretty much from the Pauline Epistles. And it's not certain that those specific passages that are isolated out of the Pauline epistles actually existed and were in circulation about people, you know, before Paul wrote that because it's the best explanation of various features of the text. [...]  There is no difference between saying that First Corinthians 15 is pre-Pauline creed and  saying that the Q document existed and this is the material from Q. In both cases, we are drawing inferences from from the literary features of the text that we do have about existence of texts that are not actually directly evidenced in the manuscript record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pasted image 20220330062711.png" src="https://bblais.github.io/images/Pasted image 20220330062711.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James: "eyewitnesses who could have contradicted such accounts" How do you know they didn't? This is the question that I always ask when they say so and so would have  told against it, would have pulled the body out, would have done whatever -- how do you know they didn't? We have no knowledge either way. &lt;/p&gt;

I've &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/search.html?q=miracles"&gt;written about miracles a number of times&lt;/a&gt;, but there always seems to something new to say.  In this episode, the skeptic is Michael Shermer whose approach by and large I don't like.  I find he isn't very direct, has long explanations and stories -- which is inefficient in this format -- and many of his responses are not actually relevant.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theists presented two main specific miracle claims:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pqj2i9gb8U&amp;amp;t=1s"&gt;Bruce Van Natta&lt;/a&gt; who had a truck fall on him, destroying much of his intestine, but shortly after prayer his intestine miraculously regrew.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0QtFCpFg9I"&gt;Chris Gunderson&lt;/a&gt; who was born with an incurable disorder called Chronic Pseudo Obstruction Syndrome, which was cured by prayer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and then they referred to the Heidi Baker ministries work in Mozambique healing many.  You can read about it in the &lt;a href="https://pcpj2.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/study_of_the_therapeutic_effects_of_proximal-5.pdf"&gt;journal article here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite my attempts, I can't find medical journal descriptions of the two cases for Van Natta and Gunderson.  However, I did find the original study on the work of Heidi Baker, but I had already &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2020/Jul/09/skepticism-and-dubious-medical-procedures/"&gt;responded to that source and those claims elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;. TLDR -- the study has serious problems and is unconvincing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's another way to put it.  What would we expect in a universe that is complex, that we understand reasonably well but with significant gaps in our understanding, but that we also tend to understand better over time?  What would we expect if there really is an agent that answers some requests, and has the ability to do truly miraculous things?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's the same sort of question one asks about alien abductions.  What would we expect in a universe where the aliens aren't here, and our own understanding and tech increases in time, vs if the aliens are here from time to time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both of these cases, we'd expect the situation without external agencies to be a smattering of weird cases that remain unexplained currently, but with no obvious pattern to them.  We'd also expect that we'd get &lt;em&gt;fewer&lt;/em&gt; of these cases (normalizing to population number and rate of information spread) over time. We'd expect geographical areas that have less access to our best understanding and technology to have more of these cases.  We'd expect that the more skeptical we look at the claims, the more closely we look at the evidence, that the evidence for the claims tends to evaporate.  It is no coincidence that UFO claims have gone down as we've put a camera in everyone's pocket.  This is the hallmark of a false claim.  The same occurs with miracle claims -- they have every hallmark of a false claim. The smattering of currently unexplained miracle claims lack available evidence to inspect, show no real pattern, and are against a backdrop of claims that have been debunked.   These miracle claims are also against a backdrop of nearly universal prayer across the population, with little to no effect.  Finally, where I have been able to find the evidence, the actual strength of the evidence on the ground is profoundly weak.  In all other cases, I have not been able to even find the evidence -- only the claims.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This backdrop of failed prayer and debunked miracle claims highlight the fact that miracle &lt;em&gt;claims&lt;/em&gt; are likely to be false, lowering their prior probability.  If prayer were a new claimed medical procedure, no one would take it seriously with such a false claim and negative result rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the guests, Craig Keener, stated that Heidi's Baker's miracles were happening regularly, yet none of the guests seemed willing to address why that might not be happening in a country with the technology able to discern false from true effects?  The single study they quoted is riddled with problems, and you'd think they'd want to perform a more detailed study here.  They claimed that miracles are hard to study, because miracles are rare events and can't be predicted ahead of time, but that seems a convenient excuse -- and not always the case, if Heidi Baker is to be believed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Craig Keener also hinted that there &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; a pattern to the miracles, but didn't come out and say what he was strongly suggesting, that Christian miracles were the ones that were mostly happening.  Any pattern that Keener might have been hinting at would be testable!  It certainly would go a long way to supporting the veracity of miracle claims if you could specify a pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find myself still unconvinced by the few claims, with little pattern or evidence, but perhaps as our understanding grows we'll get more confirmed cases, as we would expect for a true effect.  My bet is that these claims will continue to be in retreat just as the UFOs seem to have left us as our ability to detect them has increased.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="religion"></category><category term="unbelievable"></category></entry><entry><title>Sometimes there really isn't enough evidence to believe a claim</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2022/Feb/03/sometimes-there-really-isnt-enough-evidence-to-believe-a-claim/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-02-03T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-02-03T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2022-02-03:/posts/2022/Feb/03/sometimes-there-really-isnt-enough-evidence-to-believe-a-claim/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A particular response has now happened twice in an ongoing discussion about extraordinary claims, and I felt I needed to think about it more deeply.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2022/Jan/24/ongoing-conversation-with-jonathan-mclatchie/"&gt;My Response&lt;/a&gt;, along with a comment thread&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://jonathanmclatchie.com/bayesian-probability-and-the-resurrection-a-reply-to-brian-blais/"&gt;McLatchie's response&lt;/a&gt;, he said of my criticism of the claimed Barbara Synder healing, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it is a fallacy to say that, because we could in principle have better evidence, we therefore do not have &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;sufficient&lt;/em&gt; evidence. One can have compelling evidence even when a case could be rendered stronger with even more evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which I agree with, at least technically.  In the comment thread of &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2022/Jan/24/ongoing-conversation-with-jonathan-mclatchie/"&gt;my response,&lt;/a&gt; Caleb J writes,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems we disagree on how much evidence is enough. It's always possible to ask for more (Couldn't more doctors have seen it? Couldn't the medical records have been earlier?) but there comes a point when enough is enough. Exactly &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; this point is depends on considerations around prior probability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a reasonable question to ask -- how much evidence is enough?  It is also correct to say that it depends on the prior probability of the claim, but it also depends on other &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2019/Jun/16/probability-its-not-just-about-the-math/"&gt;desiderata of Jaynes&lt;/a&gt;, especially the ones dealing with consistency.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some of these cases, I'm expecting evidence that &lt;em&gt;should be there&lt;/em&gt; if the claim is true.  It's not just saying that the evidence provided is lacking, but there is missing evidence that would be expected on the truth of the claim -- making it an argument against the claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caleb was very nice in pointing out the &lt;a href="https://1c15.co.uk/barbara-snyder-barbara-cummiskey-snyder-healed-from-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;documentation for the Barbara Snyder case&lt;/a&gt;, and correcting me in its reading.  I commented about it like,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking about the Snyder "miracle", I do wonder why in these cases there isn't much more extensive medical documentation? It would seem that these people are constantly dealing with skeptics, and the easiest way to address it would be to get the pre- and post- medical test data rather than a summary by one doctor, after the fact. Is it possible she was misdiagnosed -- it wasn't MS, so looking for an MS recovery may be misdirected? Is it possible that there was MS and something else, in which case looking for a full recovery from MS is misdirected? Without further data, it is impossible to rule out these things, but you'd think the data would be available with something this recent?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how much evidence really is enough?  Can we come to any agreement here?  I think we can.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is trying to determine whether a particular action or treatment actually &lt;em&gt;causes&lt;/em&gt; the subsequent (positive) results.  It's not enough to be given the treatment and see an improvement afterward.  Why not?  Partly, because we are human and have many biases.  Further, the world is complex and any given effect can have many different possible causes, especially if we are talking about biological systems.  We therefore have to design our investigation to reduce these biases and rule out other possible causes.   &lt;em&gt;Sometimes there really isn't enough available evidence to substantiate a claim&lt;/em&gt;.  Even for much more modest claims than the ones made in the above discussions, randomized-controlled studies are the gold standard.  Check out &lt;a href="https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/?s=control&amp;amp;category_name=&amp;amp;submit=Search"&gt;https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/?s=control&amp;amp;category_name=&amp;amp;submit=Search&lt;/a&gt; to see the value of doing controlled studies in the field of medicine -- and where it goes wrong when people don't do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens if you don't have randomized-controlled studies in medicine?  What about single cases?  It is pretty clear that not much can be said confidently.  And certainly one shouldn't be willing to upend ones knowledge of how the universe works based on one report by one doctor on one patient.  Here's where consistency comes in and the  &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2019/Jun/16/probability-its-not-just-about-the-math/"&gt;desiderata of Jaynes&lt;/a&gt;.  If you are willing to believe the Barbard Snynder case, then you should be willing to believe  &lt;a href="Parkinson's healed with &amp;quot;Energy Healing&amp;quot;: https://crimsonpublishers.com/acam/fulltext/ACAM.000559.php"&gt;this woman was healed of Parkinson's with "Energy Healing"&lt;/a&gt; or you should believe in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates#cite_note-5"&gt;Golden Plates of Joseph Smith&lt;/a&gt; (making you a Mormon).  The latter has more eyewitness testimony than we have for Barbara Snyder.  It is quite clear that once you allow one miraculous healing in, using evidence of just one person, then one has to let in a whole host of others.  We can also ask how the miracle believer handles the many cases where seemingly miraculous things happen and no reported prayer, with &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20150306-the-mystery-of-vanishing-cancer"&gt;disapearing disease without treatment&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not just about the priors, it's the fact that &lt;em&gt;to be consistent&lt;/em&gt;, once you raise your prior for one sort of claim you're doing it for many others -- many claims that you probably don't want to accept.  Medical science has come a long way recognizing the fact that humans are easily fooled, they see patterns and agency where there isn't any good evidence, and biology is messy enough that uncertainty is always something to consider.  Even in seemingly obvious cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't believe Barbara Snyder was cured by the intervention of some agent outside the natural world.  If that agent were doing these kinds of actions we would expect to see a bigger effect, or that agent is being capricious.  It is &lt;em&gt;justified&lt;/em&gt; to demand better evidence, because we do that for even more modest claims, and we have centuries of data on the failings of human reasoning in inferring causes from effects.  We know better now, and we often know what the minimum amount of data is to justify a particular claim.  Data sets with &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(N=1\)&lt;/span&gt; are not convincing in any field.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;My two-part response &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2022/Jan/18/bad-apologetics/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2022/Jan/17/proton-decay-and-the-resurrection-of-jesus/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://jonathanmclatchie.com/bayesian-probability-and-the-resurrection-a-reply-to-brian-blais/"&gt;McLatchie's response&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I try to go through somewhat systematically, but by the end there are lot of interesting directions.  Hope some of this is fruitful!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given Blais’ apparent interest in the proper application of Bayesian probability theory, why does Blais not say a word about Dillahunty’s incredibly poor understanding of it, which was made plain at numerous points during his debate with me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this response, I went and rewatched the &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/a-wIaCRIdOA"&gt;Dillahunty debate&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EubkDIZ_AJI"&gt;debate review McLatchie had with Braxton Hunter&lt;/a&gt;.  I haven't gone back to do a detailed response to that debate, but in my OP I was simply referring to things I heard in that debate that I also heard in &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2020/May/29/jonathan-and-brian-in-conversation/"&gt;my own discussion with McLatchie&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href="https://www.premierchristianradio.com/Shows/Saturday/Unbelievable/Episodes/Unbelievable-Do-extraordinary-claims-require-extraordinary-evidence-Jonathan-McLatchie-vs-Jonathan-Pearce"&gt;discussion with Pearce&lt;/a&gt;.  I was focussing on the common points being brought up, and not addressed, and not on the score of any particular debate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a frequentist metric, this would be judged to be an extraordinary claim. However, in the case of spontaneous proton decay, there may be theoretical considerations that inform our background knowledge and therefore increase the event’s prior probability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hypothesis of spontaneous proton decay, despite its having never been observed, is not a wild guess, but rather has a theoretical underpinning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree here.  It is an extraordinary claim!  So we need, as Sagan says, &lt;em&gt;extraordinary&lt;/em&gt; evidence.  We can be more confident when there is a theoretical expectation, built on many other experiments that have been confirmed.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise with the resurrection, the idea that Jesus rose from the dead, even before consideration of the direct evidence, is not some wild guess without any relevant background considerations. Rather, it is made plausible by other background considerations, &lt;a href="https://jonathanmclatchie.com/extraordinary-claims-and-evidence-a-review-of-jonathan-pearces-book-on-the-resurrection-part-1/"&gt;as enumerated in my previous essay&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where the comparison fails -- it's the nature of the "background considerations" or "theoretical underpinning" that makes it strikingly different.  Both are incredibly rare events, by anyone's standard, and any evidence that could potentially be interpreted as the result of more common events should be suspect.  That's why science has controls for alternative effects, that's why science designs experiments to rule out alternatives by making &lt;em&gt;specific&lt;/em&gt; predictions of which events will happen under which circumstances, etc...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;considerations other than frequency can and do bear on the prior probability of an event occurring&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McLatchie is correct, but perhaps it's a little better to recognize that one person's prior is a previous person's posterior?   This is the nature of cumulative cases, I believe, which is what McLatchie typically espouses.  If we start from scratch, then both proton decay and the Resurrection of Jesus are rare events -- one might even argue that the proton decay, a-priori is &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; likely.  But now we start layering on our growing understanding of the world.  The Standard Model is the result of a century of painstaking experiments to construct an admittedly unintuitive yet outrageously accurate model of the world, which has been confirmed by more observations than I can count.  And it doesn't even predict proton decay!  It is in extensions of the Standard Model, all of which must be consistent with the Standard Model and General Relativity -- our best understanding of the universe -- which predict proton decay.  We are as confident in those claims as we are in the massive amount of supporting experiments and confirmed predictions.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we start doing the same for the Resurrection, we get a very different story.  We have a claim that directly violates our understanding of how the universe works, against a backdrop of many cultures making similar claims.  The best (only?) evidence we have are texts from a pre-scientific world, from authors we can only attempt to infer, with very little information of their providence.  McLatchie might be inclined to add evidence for intelligent design and fine tuning, but these concepts have not convinced the experts in those fields, so they are at best not well understood and do not count as significant evidence.  We also have many other cases of claims written in this text -- handling snakes, healing in Jesus' name, demon possession, etc... which have since been demonstrated to be false and not anything comparable that would indicate anything other than human construction.  This is similar to alien abduction cases never coming up with anything that would indicate &lt;em&gt;alien&lt;/em&gt; tech or &lt;em&gt;alien&lt;/em&gt; knowledge -- it's always completely consistent with the knowledge of the people at the time and place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The laws of nature, we must say, describe the ways in which the world — including, of course, human beings — works when left to itself, when not interfered with." - John Mackie&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a terrible way to view scientific explanations.  It tries to have a "get out of jail free" card for whatever one feels like injecting into the system -- fairies, gods, magic, etc...  But I can see the power of the analogy.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but McLatchie is seeing the world (i.e. universe) like a clock with lots of gears working together.  We can describe the workings of the clock perfectly, but then if some outside agent (e.g. a person) comes in to wind it, replace a gear, or make a something run backwards for a bit that isn't in the description of the working clock, so isn't a violation of that description?   I prefer to think "natural law" as the list of things that we have to describe what goes on in the clock, from the perspective of someone in the clock.  We can see some gears, we need to infer the existence of other gears that we don't see, in order to construct the workings of the clock.  Anything that breaks this pattern is a violation of something on that list.  The "natural laws" are &lt;em&gt;descriptive&lt;/em&gt; not &lt;em&gt;prescriptive&lt;/em&gt;.  We can propose that the observed violation is due to our misunderstanding of the gears, and propose some other configurations.  We can propose that there is some outside agent.  We can propose other things.  Here's where the analogy lands -- in every single case where someone has proposed an agent, and we've been able to conclusively show what the cause was, it was another gear and not an agent.  Every. single. time.  Trying to say that a miracle is not a violation of the laws of nature, I think, is trying to excuse oneself ahead of time for something that really should be dealt with upfront -- miracles are a violation of the patterns of causes and effects we have come to expect from the universe, and are thus extremely unlikely at this point given our understanding.  It is no coincidence, I think, that the strongest cases for theism still lie &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; in those fields where there is a lot of uncertainty -- origin of life, origin of the universe, etc... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="enter-jean-luc"&gt;Enter Jean Luc&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose you are walking in a forest and stumble upon a shack that, upon initial inspection, appears to be uninhabited. Nonetheless, you decide to investigate. As you open the door, you notice a table, upon which there is a tumbler containing Earl Grey tea, which is still steeping. Now, on the hypothesis that the shack is inhabited, does it predict with high probability the presence of the steeping Earl Grey tea on the table? Hardly! Nonetheless, this observation is &lt;em&gt;very strong evidence&lt;/em&gt; that the shack is inhabited, since on that supposition the presence of the tea (even though improbable) is &lt;em&gt;far, far more probable&lt;/em&gt; than it would be on the falsehood of that hypothesis. What is important, then, is the likelihood ratio of the probabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do have to watch out about reference classes here, but I like this picture.  It's not likelihood ratio that is always critical, as we see if I walk through the process.  We come onto a shack -- so we already know there was &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; human activity there at some point in the past.  We are considering two models -- inhabited (&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(H\)&lt;/span&gt;) or uninhabited (&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(U\)&lt;/span&gt;).   Given that the shack is out in the forest, perhaps our prior is somewhat low for inhabited, so we'd have something like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$
\begin{aligned}
P(H)&amp;amp;=1/10 \\
P(U)&amp;amp;=9/10
\end{aligned}
$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Upon entering, we have hot tea on the table.  Suddenly we have something like,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$
\begin{aligned}
P(H|\text{hot tea})&amp;amp;\sim P(\text{hot tea}|H) \times 1/10 \\
P(U\text{hot tea})&amp;amp;\sim P(\text{hot tea}|U)\times 9/10
\end{aligned}
$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The likelihood of tea given inhabited might be low, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(\text{hot tea}|H) = 1/1000\)&lt;/span&gt; as McLatchie says ("on the hypothesis that the shack is inhabited, does it predict with high probability the presence of the steeping Earl Grey tea on the table? Hardly!"), but is far higher than the  likelihood of tea given uninhabited might be low, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(\text{hot tea}|U) = 1/1,000,000\)&lt;/span&gt; and is plenty to overcome the modestly low prior,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$
\begin{aligned}
P(H|\text{hot tea})&amp;amp;\sim 1/1000 \times 1/10 = 1/10,000\\
P(U|\text{hot tea})&amp;amp;\sim 1,000,000\times 9/10 = 9/1,000,000\\
T&amp;amp;=109/1,000,000 \\
\end{aligned}
$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
yielding
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$
\begin{aligned}
P(H|\text{hot tea})&amp;amp;= 1/10,000/T = 100/109 = 92\%\\
P(U|\text{hot tea})&amp;amp;=9/1,000,000/T = 9/109 = 8\%
\end{aligned}
$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If course the numbers are probably off, but the structure is correct.  This seems to be McLatchie's point -- the likelihood ratio is the key factor!  However, notice that it is both the &lt;em&gt;prior&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;likelihood&lt;/em&gt; that come in.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think McLatchie and I are in agreement here, at least on this example.  Now, if we had considered an additional model, that "it was &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Luc_Picard"&gt;Jean Luc Picard&lt;/a&gt; had visited, and had dropped off his 'Earl Grey, hot' before beaming back to the Enterprise", we could use the same approach.  Under the Picard model (&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(J\)&lt;/span&gt;) we actually expect Earl Grey (hot) &lt;em&gt;specifically&lt;/em&gt; so it's likelihood is very high
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$
\begin{aligned}
P(\text{hot tea}|J) &amp;amp;= 1/3
\end{aligned}
$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So are we going to admit that it is far more likely that Jean Luc had visited?  Absolutely not -- because, prior to the data, we have a supremely low prior for him visiting.  Focussing on the likelihoods makes one much more susceptible to outlandish claims, and "just-so" thinking.  One can always come up with a model that predicts exactly the data one observes by just saying "it actually happened exactly this way", but this leads to fallacies because the priors are not handled well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="my-four-questions-and-perhaps-some-more"&gt;My Four Questions (and perhaps some more)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So then McLatchie responds to my four questions.  Those questions were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you make a &lt;strong&gt;prediction&lt;/strong&gt; of when miraculous healing, or any other miracles, will happen -- or is it always post-hoc?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you make any description of a measurement that could be done, no matter how impractical, for directly confirming any of the &lt;strong&gt;predictions&lt;/strong&gt; from the God-theory?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You mentioned a case of a healing of Irene McDonald with multiple sclerosis, but I can't find the medical details (i.e. the actual doctor's reports, the detailed timeline, etc...). Same with the case of Barbara Schnyder. Can you provide those? (note -- some of your other medical miracle claims were &lt;a href="http://localhost:8000/posts/2020/Jul/09/skepticism-and-dubious-medical-procedures/"&gt;suspect after I researched them&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How did you determine that these people were healed &lt;em&gt;by prayer&lt;/em&gt; and also &lt;em&gt;by God&lt;/em&gt;? You can't answer "because they prayed and she was healed after" (post-hoc fallacy) and you can't answer "because they prayed to the Christian God", because some other God may have answered, or some other thing. You have to, in your explanation, be able to distinguish from the prayers that haven't worked, the cases where healing happened without prayer or with prayer to another God. Without this, you can't make a reasonable claim that God-did-it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His answers, in short, were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it is not necessary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it is not necessary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it is not necessary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;correlation is good evidence of causation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He offers responses like &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If parallel examples exist with such complete and enduring healing from MS without the involvement of prayer, that would significantly undermine these examples as evidence for special divine action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but there isn't good evidence that the miraculous healing occurred in the first place.  How about this case:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greta Brandt was cured of Leukemia by aliens.  Her doctor, Dr. Frans Wenderoth, confirms that she had the lethal disease and "something miraculous must have happened" for her to not have it anymore.  She herself claims that she was abducted by aliens and while on the ship they cured her.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do I believe this?  Nope.  Do I even think that the doctor's testimony is to be trusted? Not without better documentation.  All we have are the claims.   I can find a bunch more like this, but it is a waste of time, really.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, if it is the case (as many atheists allege) that &lt;em&gt;unanswered&lt;/em&gt; prayer is evidence &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; the existence of God, then it &lt;em&gt;necessarily&lt;/em&gt; follows that &lt;em&gt;answered&lt;/em&gt; prayer is evidence that &lt;em&gt;confirms&lt;/em&gt; the existence of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's true, but it's terrible evidence.  We have so many claims of healings but we have way more people who pray and go unanswered.  Even with the claims of actual healings, there aren't many that could even in principle rule out natural causes.  Even in that subset of the ones that in principle seem to be unexplainable, none of them have the necessary documentation or skeptical inquiry that allow us to rule out natural causes or demonstrate directly something other than natural causes.  McLatchie isn't moved by alien abduction stories, but the same exact pattern exists there.  It's the pattern of typical human bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the shack example above was introduced to demonstrate that one does not need "high probability predictions in order for it to be well evidentially supported", I would say that from my perspective it &lt;em&gt;is necessary&lt;/em&gt; when one is comparing against models that do make high probability predictions.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="what-would-it-take-to-convince-me"&gt;What would it take to convince me?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This question came up in the Dillahunty debate, and is reprised in the Braxton discussion.  Dillahunty has his go-to response of "I don't know what would convince me, but God would".  In a sense, I understand his point of view.  What would convince me that String Theory is true?  I really don't know, but I know it will involve &lt;em&gt;specific&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;unique&lt;/em&gt; predictions that can be verified even if I can't tell you ahead of time what those predictions would be -- that's the job of the person putting forward the model.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also for me, it is usually (at least) a two-step process.  The first step is just to determine if there is a "there there" -- is there anything to even take seriously?  In the case of a miraculous healing claim or an alien abduction story, my first step is just to establish the facts of the story -- is there anything worth investigating, or anything even possible to investigate?  This has generally come up empty, which is why I ask for medical documentation -- stories aren't enough.  I've never gotten to the second step, where one has to explain the actual event, except in scientific contexts.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can have compelling evidence even when a case could be rendered stronger with even more evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually not, I think.  There is no way you could convince me of a miraculous healing without medical documentation at a minimum.  There is no way to convince me of a violation of physical law from historical documents alone.   There are just too many alternatives, and we are awash in claims of healings and miracle claims (as Keener points out) but mighty thin on the ground for actual corroboration.  The process of overturning our fundamental understanding involves &lt;em&gt;specific&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;unique&lt;/em&gt; predictions that can be verified, a back and forth of peer review and skepticism, an honest evaluation of the uncertainties, etc....  Historical data is just not sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like so many critics, Blais does not seem to appreciate the value of casualness in assessing historical reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree here -- I don't appreciate the inference from casual agreements, because it all seems so post-hoc and unconstrained.  At best, it is unclear.  In history, it may be a useful technique because one has nothing better.  To justify changing our fundamental understanding of the universe, it is thoroughly uncompelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a-direct-message-to-jonathan-mclatchie"&gt;A direct message to Jonathan McLatchie&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonathan McLatchie, if you've gotten this far, please read this (maybe I'll make it a separate post as well to make it more accessible).   You complained about some of Dillahunty's tactics in debate, and I agree for the most part.  I also think there is one that you display that you should be aware of.   It's not anything I think you do intentionally, but it has a particular effect you may not realize and I think it leads to frustration for you when others seemingly don't engage with your evidence.  Perhaps by pointing it out, it will help you communicate your points better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you talk about the Bible most atheists hear this as if you are a rabid Star Trek fan or Harry Potter fan.   You will have statements like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as Timothy McGrew &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/GH11Ur8cjwM?t=3423"&gt;observes concerning the claimed resurrection of Jesus&lt;/a&gt;, “The witnesses are not all confined to one vantage point, as they were in the case of the stage magician.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are actually various lines of evidence that support the historicity of Jesus’ death on the day of Passover, though time did not permit me to discuss them in the debate with Pearce. First, this is a detail attested by all four gospels and implied by Paul in 1 Corinthians 5:7. The evidence bearing on the substantial trustworthiness and scrupulousness of the gospel authors is also relevant here. This is &lt;strong&gt;not a detail that the gospel authors (or their sources) plausibly misremembered,&lt;/strong&gt; since so many details in the gospels are connected to Jesus’ death being at the time of Passover. [emphasis mine]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This still leaves a few loose ends that need addressing. First, what does John mean when he says, “for that Sabbath was a high day?” I would argue that he means that it was a particularly special feast day, not just any Sabbath day, but &lt;em&gt;Sabbath in Passover week&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since atheists are not convinced of the story, despite your confidence that it was written by truthful accurate (yet unknown) authors, many of your defenses sound like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course there is a three-headed dog, because the books are accurate on those points where we can confirm them (e.g. there is a King's Cross Station), and Hermione is always truthful and accurate in her descriptions.  The book describes multi-sensory experiences of the three-headed dog, by groups of people (Hagrid, Hermione, Ron, and Harry).  The second book has casual coincidences which show that the authors of the two books were independent.  There is no way that the experience they had of a three-headed dog could have plausibly been misremembered.  How could you explain the cut in Snape's leg if the three-headed dog didn't do it?   When Harry is at the zoo, and the snake winks to him, this may seem like a contradiction (snakes don't have eyelids), but when the author uses the word "wink" I'd argue that he means the definition of "To shine fitfully; twinkle.".  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sure you won't see these as parallel yourself, but this is &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; how I hear your defenses for the most part. So, quoting long sections of the Bible to support your claim is as effective as reading chapters of Harry Potter to me.  In a debate, when you read long passages in the Bible I take it as a huge waste of time and shows a lack of understanding of your opponents position.   I don't think it is intentional, because I think you do it to be thorough, but it has that effect and it comes off as a kind of a dodge -- wasting time to avoid more direct addressing of the problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this will help you understand where I'm coming from, which responses I can actually grapple with and which I just don't take seriously despite your confidence in them. &lt;/p&gt;

Jonathan McLatchie vs Jonathan Pearce&lt;/a&gt; I was struck by several claims and points, especially made by Jonathan McLatchie.   I went back and listened to two other debates with him, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/a-wIaCRIdOA"&gt;one with Matt Dillahunty&lt;/a&gt;  and &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2020/May/29/jonathan-and-brian-in-conversation/"&gt;one with myself&lt;/a&gt; and found some of the points Pearce made against McLatchie were things that both I and Matt had brought up -- mostly about McLatchie's apparent over-fondness for stories over real evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bayes-factors-and-confidence"&gt;Bayes Factors and Confidence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonathan McLatchie talks about cumulative cases, using the vocabulary of probability theory, such as,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have two pieces of evidence each with a base factor of 10 and then combined they have a cumulative base factor of 100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He thinks in terms of &lt;em&gt;independent&lt;/em&gt; data pushing the likelihoods up and down so that once you've used one data point to update the likelihoods, you can start with that updated likelihood with the next data point -- ignoring any possible dependency between one data point and another.  As we see below, it also ignores priors. This makes the process easy, but it leads to false positives which can be seen in a trivial example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in my book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2019/Jan/14/stats-for-everyone/"&gt;Statistical Inference for Everyone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, I use an example of drawing cards from a deck of (unusual) cards and trying to infer which deck.  At some point we have drawn a number of 9's (with replacement) in a row, and are trying to infer whether the deck is a so-called High deck (which has 10 10's, 9 9's, 8 8's, ... , 2 2's and 1 A ), a so-called Low deck (which has  1 10, 2 9's, ... , and 10 A's), and a so-called Nines deck (which has all 9's).  The Nines deck is a-priori a lot less probable, because we were simply told that there were two decks -- High and Low.  However, after many draws of 9 in a row that claim seems less likely.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://bblais.github.io/images/Pasted image 20220118061447.png" width=80% align=center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Bayes factors alone, the data would only support the Nines deck and miss the actual (correct) inference.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another problem with ignoring priors is that it commits you to believe many other crazy claims and would lead you to &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2010/Aug/28/the-non-psychic-octopus/"&gt;believe in psychic octopuses&lt;/a&gt;.  I made this point with McLatchie and so did Matt Dillahunty -- if you have a flawed epistemology then you will be forced to either believe in crazy things or be inconsistent and hypocritical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rarity-of-miracles-is-evidence-against-them"&gt;Rarity of Miracles is Evidence Against Them&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McLatchie states, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hypothesis that God has used miracles as authenticating signs predicts that they will stand out against the normal course of nature.  The fact that miracles do in fact stand out against nature cannot be taken as evidence against miracles because the hypothesis predicts very strongly that's what you'll find.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What McLatchie doesn't seem to see is that &lt;em&gt;regardless of the source&lt;/em&gt; any purported cause of an event which is rare &lt;em&gt;has a low prior&lt;/em&gt;, which should be used against it when comparing to other causes with higher priors.  Since God is supposedly using miracles as "authenticating signs", if you are going to interpret any particular event as a miracle you have to overcome the low prior -- "authenticating signs" would be rare -- support it with stronger evidence than would be needed for a more mundane explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would further ask McLatchie, why should authenticating signs be rare in the first place?  Why couldn't God make a miracle like his name written in the clouds every time the sun comes up, to authenticate his existence and power?  Also, would McLatchie have to be making arguments like this if God were a lot more obvious?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-prophecy-of-passover"&gt;The Prophecy of Passover&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one that really perplexes me is Jonathan's perspective on the prophecy that Jesus would be executed on Passover (or around Passover, depending on which Gospel you read).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;another example would be that jesus death coincides with the feast of passover so jesus dies [on Passover or around Passover] according to all four gospels [...] so jesus in the new testament is presented and portrayed as the fulfillment of that passover lamb that he is the ultimate passover lamb that the passover feasts pointed to and so it's quite a coincidence  it's quite fitting then that jesus death coincides with the feast of passover that's the strength [...]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are very good &lt;em&gt;story-reasons&lt;/em&gt; for having this be the case, the authors of the Gospels &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; the Old Testament stories, and could interpret the Jesus story in light of them and write the story accordingly.  This is so straightforward an explanation, with very little to counter it -- even if you believe the writers to be eye-witnesses.  All you'd need is for Jesus to be executed sometime in the vicinity of Passover, a short time of an oral tradition or retelling of the stories by the same people (which get naturally embellished) and you've got it.  McLatchie's argument is so uncompelling for anyone who isn't already convinced that it is remarkable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="undesigned-coincidences"&gt;Undesigned Coincidences&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another argument made by McLatchie is the supposed use of "undesigned coincidences" in the text.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="https://jonathanmclatchie.com/yes-richard-carrier-there-are-undesigned-coincidences-part-1/"&gt;one of his responses to Richard Carrier&lt;/a&gt;, McLatchie writes,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the most classic form (which Carrier is attempting to define) is when you have multiple (at least two) accounts that report an event where one account answers in passing a natural question raised incidentally by the other. Contrary to what Carrier asserts, the argument has never been that such features &lt;em&gt;prove&lt;/em&gt; there was a real story. Rather, such features are &lt;em&gt;evidence&lt;/em&gt; that a real event lies behind the reports found in the gospels — that is to say, the presence of an undesigned coincidence is more probable given the hypothesis of historicism than given the annulment of that hypothesis. Some undesigned coincidences contribute greater evidence than others. Carrier’s lack of nuance in his description of the basic argument does not get his article off to the best start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think my biggest problem with this line of thinking is that there are &lt;em&gt;major&lt;/em&gt; differences between the narratives in the Gospels.  For example, the nativity narratives are contradictory -- just try to map out the path Jesus' parents take.   The resurrection narratives too do not agree with each other, like the number of people coming and going, whether things were open or closed, or who actually saw Jesus.  When apologists have to make arguments (i.e. the text is not clear) to justify seeming discrepancies in large events, why should we pay attention to &lt;em&gt;subtle&lt;/em&gt; agreements?  Why should we be surprised that there are some agreements, when we know that there are literary and other source dependencies between the anonymous writings of the Gospels?  Again, McLatchie's argument is so uncompelling for anyone who isn't already convinced that it is remarkable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lack-of-priors"&gt;Lack of Priors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is striking how many recent apologists use Bayesian reasoning yet ignore the prior -- which means they really aren't using Bayesian reasoning but want to just &lt;em&gt;sound&lt;/em&gt; like they are.  This is a form of dishonesty, I feel, but at best it is a clumsy analysis -- and a problem that has been pointed out &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2021/Aug/29/bad-apologetics-ep-18-bayes-machine-goes-brrrrrrrrr/"&gt;for the McGrews&lt;/a&gt;, Calum Miller &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Jul/11/unbelievable-project-the-probability-of-the-resurrection/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/DRNIXn1xD_0"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2015/Aug/10/deduction-induction-and-abduction-oh-my/"&gt;Blake Giunta&lt;/a&gt;, and of course &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2020/May/29/jonathan-and-brian-in-conversation/"&gt;mentioned in my conversation with Jonathan McLatchie&lt;/a&gt;.    The use of Bayes Factors, which also ignores priors, is indicative of this approach. Why do apologists want to ignore priors?  Because what they are arguing for is, a-priori, seriously unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="religion"></category></entry><entry><title>Proton Decay and the Resurrection of Jesus</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2022/Jan/17/proton-decay-and-the-resurrection-of-jesus/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-01-17T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-01-17T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2022-01-17:/posts/2022/Jan/17/proton-decay-and-the-resurrection-of-jesus/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;Unbelievable&lt;/em&gt; podcast episode &lt;a href="https://www.premierchristianradio.com/Shows/Saturday/Unbelievable/Episodes/Unbelievable-Do-extraordinary-claims-require-extraordinary-evidence-Jonathan-McLatchie-vs-Jonathan-Pearce"&gt;Do extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence?

Jonathan McLatchie vs Jonathan Pearce&lt;/a&gt; I was struck by several claims and points, especially made by Jonathan McLatchie.   I went back and listened to two other debates with him, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/a-wIaCRIdOA"&gt;one with Matt Dillahunty&lt;/a&gt;  and &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2020/May/29/jonathan-and-brian-in-conversation/"&gt;one with myself&lt;/a&gt; and found some of the points Pearce made against McLatchie were things that both I and Matt had brought up -- mostly about McLatchie's apparent over-fondness for stories over real evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="proton-decay-and-rare-events"&gt;Proton Decay and Rare Events&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McLatchie says that the frequency with which we experience something is not always a good guide to its probability.  Although I'd suggest that it is &lt;em&gt;usually&lt;/em&gt; a very good guide, let's look at his example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McLatchie says &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_decay"&gt;proton decay&lt;/a&gt; has not been observed, but is predicted by most (if not all) grand unified theories of particle physics so frequency is not a good guide for prior probability.   He comments that the difference between a rare event that has a low prior vs one with a high prior, like that for proton decay, is that proton decay has a &lt;em&gt;theoretical underpinning&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it's not that this is just a random guess even though there's no precedent&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, he feels, the resurrection has no  precedent but also has a theoretical underpinning.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...] frequency  isn't the most helpful metric for assessing the prior probability you also want to look for whether there's a theoretical underpinning for this hypothesis and likewise with the case for christianity the case for the resurrection in particular i think that you can make a similar case from a theoretical underpinning a background information that stands independently of the extent to which there is precedence in our experience of the miraculous [...]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comparison is laughable to me, given the differences in the "theoretical underpinning" of each, but let's see how the comparison plays out.  The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model"&gt;Standard Model&lt;/a&gt; predicts that proton decay will not happen -- that it violates a conservation law --  however many models that build off of the Standard Model do include proton decay.   Given the state of affairs, I'm not sure if scientists put a large prior on proton decay anyway, but let's grant that -- say, we are reasonably confident that proton decay will occur.  What theoretical underpinning would we have to give us this confidence?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many times that science has predicted rare and unprecedented events or effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the motion of the Earth through the Ether (e.g. Michaelson-Morely experiment)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the bending of star light by a massive object (e.g. Einsteins GR prediction)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;civilizations on Mars (e.g. Lowell's canals)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the existence of the Higgs Boson (1967 work by many scientists, including &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/510036a"&gt;one of my former instructors, Gerry Guralnik&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;proton decay (predicted by many Grand Unified theories)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that several of these were not confirmed, yet at the time there were good reasons to think they were true.  Whenever science has predicted a rare, unprecedented event there have been common patterns.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the novel theory is consistent with &lt;em&gt;every other&lt;/em&gt; confirmed prediction from the other theories.  For example General Relativity describes gravity, predicts novel phenomena, but can be shown in certain limits to be consistent with Newton's Law of Gravity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the novel theory predicts &lt;em&gt;specific limits&lt;/em&gt; on the novel phenomena.  For example, General Relativity predicts the exact angle that starlight will bend passing by the known mass of the Sun, and specifically how accurately the measurements need to be made.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ones confidence in a novel theory's prediction, before the prediction is confirmed, comes down to how &lt;em&gt;much the other predictions of the novel theory have been confirmed&lt;/em&gt; -- especially if the theory has made several striking confirmed predictions.  For example, scientists were confident in the existence of gravity waves for a long time before they were observed, because General Relativity had passed every test to an accuracy as good as we could measure, and many of those tests were profoundly unintuitive and unexpected.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can be confident in the prediction of proton decay in as much as those theories that predict it have been confirmed to a great degree on other terms.  For example, &lt;a href="https://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/PT.3.2223"&gt;"the standard model predicts the electron magnetic moment to an astonishing accuracy of one part in a trillion."&lt;/a&gt;  The Standard Model is also consistent with every other theory within its domain, and doesn't violate any outside of its domain (the role of gravity, for example, is outside the Standard Model).  Grand unified theories all have to be as accurate as the Standard Model to be considered.  It is these factors that make us confident in the prediction of novel phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does the "theoretical underpinning" of the God-theory for the Resurrection stack up?  The things that McLatchie brings up are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keener's book of Miracles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is merit to Lewis trilemma (i.e. Liar, Lunatic, Lord)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;multi-sensory experiences, with groups, around the Resurrection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;prophecy such as Christianity becoming a global religion, predicted in the Old Testament&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus executed on/around passover, predicted in the Old Testament&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The episode dealt with these topics pretty well, and I've written a bit about some of them, including &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/May/21/a-little-about-miracles/"&gt;miracles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Mar/18/unbelievable-project-miracles-and-healing-is-it-evidence-for-the-truth-of-christianity/"&gt;healings&lt;/a&gt;,  and &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2020/May/29/jonathan-and-brian-in-conversation/"&gt;my conversation with Jonathan McLatchie&lt;/a&gt;.  But simply compare the theories around proton decay and those of the Resurrection.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one is consistent with &lt;em&gt;every other&lt;/em&gt; confirmed prediction from the other theories -- the other isn't.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one predicts &lt;em&gt;specific limits&lt;/em&gt; on the novel phenomena, including time frames and what &lt;em&gt;specific&lt;/em&gt; steps we'd need to confirm it  -- the other doesn't.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one has a pile of other novel &lt;em&gt;specific&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;quantitative&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;predictions&lt;/strong&gt; that have since been confirmed -- the other doesn't.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I want to ask Jonathan McLatchie a few questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you make a &lt;strong&gt;prediction&lt;/strong&gt; of when miraculous healing, or any other miracles, will happen -- or is it always post-hoc?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you make any description of a measurement that could be done, no matter how impractical, for directly confirming any of the &lt;strong&gt;predictions&lt;/strong&gt; from the God-theory?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You mentioned a case of a healing of Irene McDonald with multiple sclerosis, but I can't find the medical details (i.e. the actual doctor's reports, the detailed timeline, etc...).  Same with the case of Barbara Schnyder.  Can you provide those? (note -- some of your other medical miracle claims were &lt;a href="http://localhost:8000/posts/2020/Jul/09/skepticism-and-dubious-medical-procedures/"&gt;suspect after I researched them&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How did you determine that these people were healed &lt;em&gt;by prayer&lt;/em&gt; and also &lt;em&gt;by God&lt;/em&gt;?  You can't answer "because they prayed and she was healed after" (post-hoc fallacy) and you can't answer "because they prayed to the Christian God", because some other God may have answered, or some other thing.  You have to, in your explanation, be able to distinguish from the prayers that haven't worked, the cases where healing happened without prayer or with prayer to another God.  Without this, you can't make a reasonable claim that God-did-it.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methodological naturalism&lt;/em&gt; is the only choice we have available, because no one has demonstrated any procedure to distinguish supernatural claims. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To assume a naturalistic explanation in the future is simply the recognition that in &lt;em&gt;every single case&lt;/em&gt; where we have finally understood a topic, the best explanation has &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; turned out to be supernatural...&lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://disqus.com/by/r_morales/"&gt;R Morales&lt;/a&gt; replies that my response is a &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"bit like someone using a metal detector to [...] look for valuable natural resources such as gold, silver or gems, only finding valuable metals, and then concluding that therefore it is unlikely that there are nonmetal valuable resources in that mine, "&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've heard this analogy before, and I think it is worth responding to because on the face it does seem reasonable.  The second you restrict the target of a search, then it shouldn't be surprising that you don't find certain things, right?  As with all analogies, one has to make sure that the relevant components are considered.  Let me see if I can use the metal detector analogy to convey my original statement better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're on a beach, and other than sand, there are objects we might discover buried there. I note that there are some metal objects, and build a metal detector.  At first my metal detector is not terrific -- it can only find large objects -- but I keep improving it over the years to find smaller and smaller objects.  Now, my friend says that he sees plastic objects that I can't detect with my detector.  "Yay!" I say, and ask him for his plastic detector.  He doesn't have one.  He has provided no way to detect plastic, but says that he can see it.  "See that lump over there, it's hiding a plastic object".  I go over with my metal detector, and find that the lump is caused by a metal object.  He keeps doing this, pointing this way and that, and I keep detecting metal, and he continues to provide no method for detecting plastic despite his claims.  Further, every claim of a plastic object turns out to be metal.  Sometimes it takes a while -- the object is made of some unknown material, my friend insists it's plastic, and it turns out to be metal anyway.   This goes on for years and years.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if someone on the beach produces some unknown object, what are the chances that it is plastic?  How would you know?  If you were forced to bet, what bet would you do -- metal or plastic?  &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="religion"></category></entry><entry><title>Skepticism and Dubious Medical Procedures</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2020/Jul/09/skepticism-and-dubious-medical-procedures/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-07-09T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-07-09T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2020-07-09:/posts/2020/Jul/09/skepticism-and-dubious-medical-procedures/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In my discussion with Jonathan McLatchie on the Still Unbelievable podcast, I said that there hasn’t been a verified miracle claim even since Hume’s essay on miracles.

Jonathan then told me two: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Case report of instantaneous resolution of juvenile macular degeneration blindness after proximal intercessory prayer”, Clarissa Romez, Kenn Freedman, David Zaritzky, Joshua W. Brown. &lt;em&gt;Explore&lt;/em&gt;. Available online 28 February 2020 &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550830720300926"&gt;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550830720300926&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Case Report of gastroparesis healing: 16 years of a chronic syndrome resolved after proximal intercessory prayer”,Clarissa Romeza, David Zaritzky, Joshua W. Brown. &lt;em&gt;Complementary Therapies in Medicine&lt;/em&gt;. Volume 43, April 2019, Pages 289-294.  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965229918313116"&gt;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965229918313116&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when I looked at this, I kept finding those two and a third, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Study of the Therapeutic Effects of Proximal Intercessory Prayer (STEPP) on Auditory and Visual Impairments in Rural Mozambique”, Candy Gunther Brown, Stephen C Mory, Rebecca Williams, Michael J McClymond.  &lt;em&gt;South Med J&lt;/em&gt;. 2010 Sep;103(9):864-9 &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20686441/"&gt;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20686441/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These three kept popping up again and again.  The journals have dubious standards, and the authors work for the same institution (&lt;a href="https://www.globalmri.org/about"&gt;https://www.globalmri.org/about&lt;/a&gt;).  On their website there is the following request: “We’re always looking for new testimonies. Do you have a testimony that is medically verified?”.  Could you imagine a similar claim written about, say, a homeopathic remedy for cancer?  If you took our remedy, and improved, we want to hear from you.  Otherwise, not.  Regardless of the contents of the specific studies, this sort of fishing for positive results is thoroughly unscientific and casts significant doubt on any results from this institution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My suspicions were confirmed going to &lt;a href="http://sciencebasedmedicine.org"&gt;http://sciencebasedmedicine.org&lt;/a&gt; (a great resource) where they have an article about the 3rd study in the list above:  &lt;a href="https://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/proximal-intercessory-prayer/"&gt;https://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/proximal-intercessory-prayer/&lt;/a&gt;  Bottom line, this study has numerous, basic scientific problems with it and the results cannot be trusted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find that argument that a deity is better able to heal when the person asking them to do so is physically close to the person they are praying for absurd, lame, and convenient. It is a nice excuse to unblind the protocol, and nothing else –  a way of generating false-positive results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the process for collecting subjects used by these authors and supported by their institution,  in addition to their experimental design, is constructed with the sole purpose of bypassing the methods of science.  I was particularly surprised when I dug into the first study, went into their supplemental information, and saw a nice timeline of events (&lt;strong&gt;emphasis mine&lt;/strong&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[…]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;June 14 1960  Complete Neurological Examination Completely normal except for macular degeneration “cause undetermined”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1971 Examination confirms “ legal blindness” Recording of Visual Acuities - are consistent with legal blindness. No glasses recommended.  Degeneration and scaring (sic) of macula in both eyes &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1971-1974 Record of a series of Visual Acuities Visual Acuities consistent with legal blindness until record of 1974  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1/29/71  Visual Acuity  Right Eye- Finger Count  Left Eye - Hand motion- All without glasses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1-18-72  Right Eye - Hand Motion,  Left Eye - Hand Motion &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6-14-74 Right Eye - 20/100-1 Left Eye - 20/100-2  All (above) without glasses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1972 Learned to use a cane and read braille.  Blind Services: orientation and mobility skills and braille reading  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;02/18/1972-05/18/1972: Patient reports going through a Training Center to learn to walk with a cane and read braille. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1972   August Vision restored through PIP &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 4, 2001 Complete Eye Examination&lt;/strong&gt; VA 20/40 OD, 20/40-2 OS Corrected VA 20/40 OU None recorded Visual Acuity 20/40, 20/40-2.  Glasses -0.25 OD, -0.50 OS Normal eye exam except for evidence of dry eye early cataract changes. Optic nerves and maculae recorded as normal but also states + RPE dropout in macula OU.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;October 16, 2001  Return Visit. Treatment for Dry Eyes Provided&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;October 3, 2012.  Cataract surgery of right eye&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Etc…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the time between the prayer and the eye exam is…29 years!  This is “instantaneous resolution”?  Essentially, we’re taking this patient's word that their eyesight improved after prayer, but the authors (or anyone else) didn’t bother to test it for nearly 30 years.  This level of incompetence, poor design, and digging for positive results is staggering.  This is not the way one confirms medical claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second study seems at least a bit better, but with no controls, and knowing that the authors have a history of ludicrously bad design leaves me unconvinced.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I have tried to convey here is the process for investigating claims.  You look at the originals, you examine methods and possible ways the authors could have (deliberately or not) biased the results.  This is why we have blinding processes for medical experiments, and controls.  Otherwise you can always fall victim to false positives and rare one-off events.  We know that medical conditions can mysteriously improve (biology is complex and not entirely understood), so if you want to show your method of treatment actually works you do need to follow reasonable, skeptical procedures established by science.  It's certainly hard to do this, takes more time and work, but there is good reason why we trust science.  The lazy procedures of these authors -- including a self-proclaimed fishing for positive results -- is at best a cop-out and at worst a dishonest attempt to peddle bogus treatments.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="religion"></category></entry><entry><title>Probability of the Resurrection</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2019/Sep/03/probability-of-the-resurrection/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-09-03T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-09-03T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2019-09-03:/posts/2019/Sep/03/probability-of-the-resurrection/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In a recent discussion about the use of probability in a religious context I saw another poor job of a calculation of the Resurrection (I had read several others that …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In a recent discussion about the use of probability in a religious context I saw another poor job of a calculation of the Resurrection (I had read several others that had serious problems).  I then felt that it would be good to sketch out how it &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be done.  The goal here is not to come up with a single number, but to have a structure which invites discussion.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a-smaller-problem"&gt;A smaller problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are restricting the problem to the smallest possible case to most easily see the form that the calculation takes when done properly.  The problem is &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend of yours flipped a coin three times and got heads three times in a row.  Would this be good evidence for your friend having a coin with two heads compared to, say, a typical coin with 1 heads and 1 tails?  Here we have 2 models (&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(M_1\)&lt;/span&gt;, say, is for the 1-headed coin model and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(M_2\)&lt;/span&gt; is for the 2-headed coin model), and some observed data (heads, heads, heads in 3 flips).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to know the probability of each of the models given the data.  In math notation we use the vertical bar,&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(|\)&lt;/span&gt;, as the symbol for "given".  The "data" is summarized as "H H H" for three observed heads flips.  So we want to obtain,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$
P(M_1 | \text{H H H})  \text{ and } P(M_2 | \text{H H H})
$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
following Bayes theorem, we write the top of Bayes equation as 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$
P(M_1 | \text{H H H}) \sim P(\text{H H H}| M_1) \times P(M_1)
$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
and
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$
P(M_2 | \text{H H H}) \sim P(\text{H H H}| M_2) \times P(M_2)
$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Before continuing, let me point out a few things.  First, I'm not using equals here, but the &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\sim\)&lt;/span&gt; sign to denote that I'm writing just the top part of the equation first.  I'll add these two things up to get the bottom of Bayes in the next step.  I do it as a two-step process to make it easier to write down (i.e. it formats better in text) and to help when we generalize to more than 2 models, where Bayes can get a bit unwieldy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(\text{H H H}| M_1)\)&lt;/span&gt; is the probability we'd see the data if we knew (i.e. we're given) that model 1 is true.  Since &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(M_1\)&lt;/span&gt; is from a fair coin, we get 1/2 probability for each head independently and we don't have any extra counting term, so we'd get the &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(\text{H H H}| M_1)=\frac{1}{2}\times\frac{1}{2}\times\frac{1}{2}\)&lt;/span&gt;.  The term &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(\text{H H H}| M_2)\)&lt;/span&gt; is the probability we'd see the data if we knew (i.e. we're given) that model 2 is true.  Since &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(M_2\)&lt;/span&gt; is from a rigged two-headed coin, we get a probability of 1 for each head so we'd get the &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(\text{H H H}| M_2)=1\times 1\times 1\)&lt;/span&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The terms &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(M_1)\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(M_2)\)&lt;/span&gt; are the prior probabilities of the model - how much we should believe them before we saw the data.  This is probably the most contentious point, and worth dwelling on.  It's not 50%, just because there are two possibilities.  Do we even know if a two-headed coin exists?  Have you ever seen one?  The two models are not symmetric.  Turns out I have seen one!  There's one in my desk, which I love to bring out to fool my students.  :-)  It was found by accident with my daughter going through all of our loose change.  I have never seen one since, but if we just took my house as an example, it's no bigger than a 1/100 of all the quarters.  This can inform the prior as &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(M_1) = 0.99\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(M_2) = 0.01\)&lt;/span&gt;.  I would guess that this is a huge &lt;em&gt;over estimate&lt;/em&gt; for the &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(M_2)\)&lt;/span&gt; but it's good to run with.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting back to our probabilities, we calculate the top terms of Bayes, add them up, and then go back to divide each by that total.  Thus we get:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$
\begin{align}
P(M_1 | \text{H H H}) &amp;amp;\sim P(\text{H H H}| M_1) \times P(M_1) = \frac{1}{2}\times\frac{1}{2}\times\frac{1}{2}\times 0.99 = 0.124 \\
P(M_2 | \text{H H H}) &amp;amp;\sim P(\text{H H H}| M_2) \times P(M_2) = 1\times 1\times 1\times 0.01 = 0.01
\end{align}
$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
(adding them up) &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(T=0.124 + 0.01 = 0.134\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;finally getting (notice the equals now)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$
\begin{align}
P(M_1 | \text{H H H}) &amp;amp;=0.124/T = 0.124/0.134=0.925 \\
P(M_2 | \text{H H H}) &amp;amp;=0.01/T=0.01/0.134 = 0.075
\end{align}
$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, finally, we can have good reason -- by a long shot -- to &lt;em&gt;not believe&lt;/em&gt; that the person has a 2-headed coin.   Although we  have a nearly &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(8\times\)&lt;/span&gt; increase in the probability of that model, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(M_2\)&lt;/span&gt;, given the observed data of 3 heads, this doesn't bring our confidence up to the level of belief - you'd need more data for that.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This problem has exactly the same structure as the problem under consideration, trying to find the probability of the resurrection given the data we have and the number of possible models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-problem-at-hand-the-probability-of-the-resurrection"&gt;The problem at hand - the probability of the Resurrection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proper way to set the problem up, like the coin, is the following.  First, we start with the different models:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(R\)&lt;/span&gt; = Resurrection happened&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(M\)&lt;/span&gt; = Resurrection story made up entirely&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(V\)&lt;/span&gt; = Resurrection story incited by visions from early apostles and embellished&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;etc...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and then the math follows just like the example above,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;data = texts of gospels and Paul (and their history)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(R | \text{data}) \sim P(\text{data} | R) \times P(R)\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(M | \text{data}) \sim P(\text{data} | M) \times P(M)\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(V | \text{data}) \sim P(\text{data} | V) \times P(V)\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.... [insert more models if you'd like]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then add up to &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(T = \ldots\)&lt;/span&gt;, and divide all terms, just like the coin.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arguments over priors can ensue, but I think it would  be fair to say that &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(M)&amp;gt;P(V) \gg P(R)\)&lt;/span&gt;. Although one might question this order (e.g.  arguing that visions are more common than story construction) it is certainly true that resurrections are far less common than stories or visions.  How often do we see resurrections?  How often do we see God raising someone from the dead?  How often have we heard claims of people being raised from the dead, from God or otherwise?  These very simple questions bring the prior for the Resurrection &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; down.  The theist will typically counter with something like "I agree that resurrections through &lt;em&gt;natural&lt;/em&gt; processes are extremely unlikely, but if there is a God he could easily make resurrections through &lt;em&gt;supernatural&lt;/em&gt; causes likely."  I'll deal specifically with this objection in detail below but at this point the term &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(R)\)&lt;/span&gt; doesn't presuppose any mechanisms - it is just the probability of a resurrection before seeing any data and it should be agreed that this is much lower than visions or stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the prior, we note that terms like &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(\text{data} | R)\)&lt;/span&gt; have to balance both the positive claims and negative claims.  For example, we might say that this term is quite high from the positive claims -- if the Resurrection actually happened then it easily explains the stories of seeing Jesus afterward.  However, there are things that we probably should have seen -- but don't -- if the Resurrection actually happened.  Some includes the lack of an account of Roman stolen-body litigation (as would have been done to the disciples), the fact that Paul doesn't mention the empty tomb, and the guards at the tomb are only mentioned in Matthew are not mentioned in Mark, Luke, John, or even Paul.  These negative claims are easily explained with the other two models but are not easily explained from the Resurrection model making &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(\text{data} | R)\)&lt;/span&gt; much lower than is generally communicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="supernatural-causation"&gt;Supernatural causation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, what about the claim that the low priors are mitigated by the issue of God &lt;em&gt;supernaturally&lt;/em&gt; raising Jesus?  Here is where it gets interesting.  If you want to add the possibility of God raising Jesus &lt;em&gt;supernaturally&lt;/em&gt; from the dead we can do this with a process called &lt;em&gt;marginalization&lt;/em&gt;, which is a fancy term for adding up all of the possibilities.  Mathematically it looks like the following,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First define some symbols,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(+G\)&lt;/span&gt; = God&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(+S\)&lt;/span&gt; = Supernatural action&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(-G\)&lt;/span&gt; = no God&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(-S\)&lt;/span&gt; = natural action&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can then draw out the probability terms (which don't mention any specific methods of resurrections) into several terms, each for a different method, and then apply Bayes' rule yielding
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$
\begin{align}
P(R | \text{data}) =&amp;amp; P(R, +G,+S | \text{data}) + P(R, -G,+S| \text{data}) + P(R, +G,-S| \text{data}) + P(R, -G,-S| \text{data})\\
\sim &amp;amp; P(\text{data}|R,+G,+S)P(R|+G,+S)P(+S|+G)P(+G) + \\ \nonumber
&amp;amp;P(\text{data}|R,-G,+S)P(R|-G,+S)P(+S|-G)P(-G) + \\ \nonumber
&amp;amp;P(\text{data}|R,+G,-S)P(R|+G,-S)P(-S|+G)P(+G) + \\ \nonumber
&amp;amp;P(\text{data}|R,-G,-S)P(R|-G,-S)P(-S|-G)P(-G) 
\end{align}
$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This messy result lets us look at individual terms to see where we might have to examine the data more closely.  Theists state that terms like &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(R|-G,-S)\)&lt;/span&gt; are small (unlikely resurrection given no God and only natural action), and I'll grant you that.  How about &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P( R | +G, -S)\)&lt;/span&gt; or, in words,  why couldn't God have done the resurrection naturally?  How about  $P( R | -G, +S) $ or, in words, couldn't Satan or Stephen Fry's evil God have done the resurrection supernaturally?  How have theists ruled these out?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, by opening up some specific alternatives, one needs to follow all of those alternatives -- and their inverses -- through the entire calculation.  You then have to provide evidence for God's supposed actions (&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(+S|+G)\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(-S|+G)\)&lt;/span&gt;) reading his inscrutable plan.  You also have to demonstrate that there are not other supernatural agents at play, and that it is likely that God is the one acting. Given that theists have yet to provide &lt;em&gt;any way&lt;/em&gt; of testing supernatural claims &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt; it seems like a big feat.  In short, by introducing supernatural causation into the mix, theists have made their life harder -- not easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I finished this review it became apparent that there are two main audiences for what I wrote - those that have yet to read the book and those that have already read the book.  Therefore I decided to break the review up into two parts, one for each audience.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="for-those-that-have-not-yet-read-unbelievable"&gt;For those that have &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; yet read &lt;em&gt;Unbelievable?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id="context"&gt;Context&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been listening to &lt;a href="https://www.premierchristianradio.com/Shows/Saturday/Unbelievable"&gt;this podcast&lt;/a&gt; for years and even had a &lt;a href="http://bblais.github.io/search.html?q=unbelievable"&gt;project several years ago&lt;/a&gt; with the lofty goal of responding to each and every episode.  I did not achieve the goal, unfortunately.  The problem was two-fold:
1. There are too many episodes
2. Nearly every episode is so packed with interesting content that my responses were taking longer than a week to prepare, so I was always behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The podcast is a model of how discussions can go, even when the topic is contentious.  Justin Brierley is the epitome of civil.  Like a good moderator, it isn't always clear where he stands on the issue - it's even easy to ignore the fact that he's a believer himself!  He does an amazing job in the podcast of rephrasing what even his opponents state - skillfully  &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man#Steelmanning"&gt;steelmanning&lt;/a&gt; the entire time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book, &lt;a href="https://www.premierchristianradio.com/Shows/Saturday/Unbelievable/Unbelievable-the-Book"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unbelievable? Why After Ten Years of Talking with Atheists I'm Still a Christian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has all the best of the podcast in book form.  It's a plea for a return to civil discourse on hard topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Having conversations as one of the most important things we do in life“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Many conversation descend into the equivalent of verbal hand grenades being lobbed over the barricades of our carefully erected worldviews.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brierley demonstrates how you can respect a position that you disagree with and how you can -- without fear -- present someone else's argument even better than they can.  I can't help but think that this book was aptly timed for this age of quick sound-bites and tweets.  We live in a culture where it seems to be acceptable to malign your opponent without addressing their concerns or characterize their positions in such uncharitable ways that everyone speaks past each other.  It is a ray of light that this book - despite the fact that I disagree strongly with its conclusions - reaches across the aisle gently and respectfully with an invitation to engage in the discussion openly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is for this reason, out of respect, that I take a thoughtful, thorough approach to this review.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="structure-of-the-book"&gt;Structure of the Book&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the first chapter on &lt;em&gt;"Creating Better Conversations,"&lt;/em&gt; the book's chapters walk the reader through all of the standard arguments for God and Christianity, sprinkled with anecdotes from Brierley's interviews.  The book reads very nicely and has a conversational tone, introducing the reader to some of Brierley's original reasons for believing - from personal experience and revelation - and many other reasons to support which belief that he admits came later along.  The book is remarkably complete and as far as I can tell, hits all the major apologetics' points - including some arguments that have been circulating in the Christian community literally for thousands of years.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brierley explains the Cosmological Arguments and the Fine Tuning Arguments in the chapter &lt;em&gt;"God Makes Sense of Human Existence."&lt;/em&gt;  The Moral Arguments, likewise, are addressed in the chapter &lt;em&gt;"God Makes Sense of Human Value."&lt;/em&gt;  He continues with arguments from purpose, the existence of Jesus, the evidence for the Resurrection, and suffering. Brierley finishes the book with a pragmatic explanation of living in the "Christian Story" and the benefits of choosing to live in that way.  For anyone not familiar with the standard arguments for Christianity, &lt;em&gt;Unbelievable?&lt;/em&gt; is a great introduction and summary of the primary arguments.  For anyone who cares about civil and intelligent dialog, this book is for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="for-those-that-have-read-unbelievable"&gt;For those that have read &lt;em&gt;Unbelievable?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I am not convinced by these arguments and Brierley is where is the divide?  I will hopefully address this question in the rest of this review.  I break each of my responses into the appropriate topics, essentially following the order of the book, discussing where I disagree with Brierley's conclusions at many places.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must admit that most of the chapters present so much of &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; sides of the arguments that the book is unusually balanced for its genre.  It also means that this review is quite a bit longer than I would do for other books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="personal-experience"&gt;Personal Experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Brierley, by his own admission, personal experience is the primary reason for his &lt;em&gt;original&lt;/em&gt; conversion.  He refers to a personal experience in a youth retreat in 1995, calling it a “moment of surrender“ where God "showed up," noting that most if not all Christians would probably relate to this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I suspect that something similar is true for most people who call themselves Christians.  It's not that they can necessarily pinpoint a 'moment of surrender' like mine, but their faith is nevertheless grounded in an experience of God's presence in their lives, perhaps in some emotionally tangible way, or simply as a deep-down 'knowing' that has been there as long as they can remember." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've never had such an experience, at least not tangibly, so I can't address Brierley's experience directly.  However, we have learned from science that personal experience that isn't accessible to others doesn't typically track reality - it tracks subjectivity.  People have profound experiences quite often and then interpret these experiences in all sorts of ways.  This does not mean that those interpretations are correct, even if the experiences themselves are real.  It is only through an honest exploration of the possible explanations, through prediction and skepticism, that we can achieve something close to the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think Brierley would disagree with this - which is why he goes to great pains to explore the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="second-law-of-thermodynamics"&gt;Second Law of Thermodynamics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My dad also said something else. As a scientist he found it intriguing that the emergence of life on our planet seems to disobey one of the fundamental laws of nature. The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that, when left to their own devices, all closed systems (such as our universe), will move towards increasing 'entropy' -- the scientific word for disorder.“ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every physicist will tell you why this is an incorrect statement - because the earth is not a closed system.  Under the logic of this quote, even something like frozen ice would not be produced on the earth because it is a lower entropy state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've had a bad experience with this particular argument in University.  The correction to the argument is both easy to find.  Further, unlike other such arguments, you won't find any disagreement with any physicist you ask.  It is the fact that the answer is so easy to find and consistent with the experts that there really is no excuse left to keep using this argument.  Even so, I have seen Christians use it &lt;em&gt;even after being corrected&lt;/em&gt;.  The claim is so outlandish, from a physical point of view, that if a scientist actually believed it, they would have to admit that a frozen pond (also a decrease in entropy) would be impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The claim presented in this quote represents a pervasive lack of imagination on the part of the theist where they seemingly can't wrap their brains around the idea that complexity can arise from natural processes.  This lack of imagination infects not just this argument, but the fine tuning argument, other arguments from design, and even the moral argument. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fine-tuning"&gt;Fine Tuning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sean Carroll, an outspoken cosmologist from CalTech, says that &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0qKZqPy9T8&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=2305"&gt;the Fine Tuning Argument is the "theist's best argument"&lt;/a&gt; and it is well communicated in "&lt;em&gt;Unbelievable?&lt;/em&gt;."  The problem is that, despite the confident claims of many theists, the physicists are not at all clear how much fine tuning there is or if there is any at all.  The way fine tuning is demonstrated starts with noticing that there are some &lt;em&gt;seemingly arbitrary&lt;/em&gt; constants in our physical laws (e.g. speed of light, expansion rate of the universe, etc...).  These constants if &lt;em&gt;varied independently&lt;/em&gt; lead to conditions where life &lt;em&gt;as we know it&lt;/em&gt;  couldn't form.  The emphasis here is to point out the problems with making confident claims about these observations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the constants may be determined by other laws we don't know right now.  This has happened already for the expansion rate of the universe, which can be specifically derived from Einstein's equations - and shown to not be fine-tuned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the constants may not be independent, so changing one may necessitate changing another by a specific amount negating the effect&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we don't understand the conditions &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; for life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these objections, it seems premature to make any strong statements about fine tuning even if you are convinced it is there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="something-out-of-nothing"&gt;Something out of nothing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is telling, I think, that the primary scientific arguments for God rely on the fringes of the known science into the unknown.  William Lane Craig makes a great deal out of the absurd notion of something "popping into existence" from nothing - and to allow even one instance of it would allow things like bicycles to appear out of nothing.  However, he doesn't address Sean Carroll directly who shows that models of the origin of the universe have some things able to appear out of nothing and other things not.  These models actually make &lt;em&gt;predictions&lt;/em&gt; for things we may observe, e.g. correlations in the microwave background, values of the early universe entropy, etc...  What &lt;em&gt;predictions&lt;/em&gt; do the theistic models actually make about the properties of the observable universe?  None to my knowledge.  It is clear that science and religion are playing by different rules here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="contingent-vs-necessary"&gt;Contingent vs Necessary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brierley comments about the argument from contingency, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I've been struck by the obvious yet remarkable fact that there is &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; at all. [...]  Like Leibniz, I can see that it's perfectly logically possible that there could have been nothing at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not a philosopher and am unconvinced by words like &lt;em&gt;contingent&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt;.  For example, I do not see any support for the claim that there are &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; objects, or that a &lt;em&gt;being&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;mind&lt;/em&gt; could satify the requirements to be &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt;.  Maybe the only things that can be &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; are things like laws of logic, and that objects don't fit that criterion.  I don't know!  But until these are actually &lt;em&gt;demonstrated&lt;/em&gt; and not just &lt;em&gt;asserted&lt;/em&gt;, all of the arguments based on them have no content.  In the same way, perhaps the concept of "&lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt;" isn't well defined and can't manifest in reality, so the question "why is there something rather than nothing" is answered simply with "because 'nothing' isn't realizable".  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s nothing about our universe to suggest that it had to exist rather its existence is contingent. It needs an explanation of his existence.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would add as an analogy that there’s nothing about our experience on the Earth to suggest that the Earth is round or that it orbits the sun.  It may be &lt;em&gt;logically&lt;/em&gt; possible to have a flat planet, but not &lt;em&gt;physically&lt;/em&gt; realizable in our universe (note: the spherical nature of planets is due to the spherical form of the law of gravitation).  Our intuitions do not always track the truth, and truth should be our goal.  As a scientist, I am accustomed to cases of seemingly obvious things being false, and of seemingly impossible things being true irrespective of our intuitions.  Thus, strictly &lt;em&gt;philosophical arguments&lt;/em&gt; are not enough to demonstrate the existence of something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="language-of-the-universe"&gt;Language of the Universe&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is the universe written in the language of mathematics? Brierley says,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who want to ask `Why?', atheism's only answer seems to be that it is a massive coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t see it as a coincidence I see it as a requirement. In &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; universe that has any patterns at all such that life could possibly exist - no matter what form of life - then those living beings would discover those patterns as the "mathematics" of that universe.  It doesn't surprise me that there are patterns in the universe, but I still agree with Brierley that it is an amazing thing that the universe exists at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"So does science provide iron-clad proof for God's existence? No.  Could the scientific consensus change in the future?  Of course it could.  Is this all there is to say on the subject?  Certainly not.  The case for God is a cumulative one that reaches well beyond science..."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I can quibble about the use of "proof" here (science doesn't deal in proof, only evidence) I'd rather take the time to extend the notion of "science" to include things like history as well as the study of morality, which moves into the next chapters.  Really, what I am thinking is that rational discourse combined with skeptical attitudes are the components that include science and these other topics.  In the case of the universe existing, perhaps an "I don't know" is the best answer we have right now, until someone is imaginative enough to find a way to determine it.  To posit the answer "I know, and it is God" requires a level of explanation and prediction far above what any theist seems able to give.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="moral-argument"&gt;Moral argument&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In discussing human value, Brierley writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It was grim stuff, admittedly, but it was a moment which exposed the problem for atheists who affirm the subjective nature of morality but then find themselves in a bind when it comes to truly horrendous acts.  They don't just feel wrong.  They &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; wrong.  Period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He concludes the chapter with,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I have tried to persuade you of two things in this chapter.  First, that humans have a real inherent worth and dignity that transcends a purely evolutionary story of how morality came to be.  Second, if humans have such a value then it only makes sense if there is someone beyond nature who can assign them such value, the God who created them in his own image.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not generally swayed by the moral argument for a few reasons.  First, I think that much is made out the subjective/objective dichotomy that someone like Sam Harris already handles consistently.  In &lt;em&gt;The Moral Landscape&lt;/em&gt;, he is able to define morality as the concern for the suffering and well-being of conscious creatures which, even if done imperfectly, coincides well with all of the sorts of problems we associate with moral choices.  In this way, he describes an &lt;em&gt;objective&lt;/em&gt; basis for morality without resorting to outside agency.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My second issue is that the supposed solution - "God did it" - fails the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthyphro_dilemma"&gt;"Euthyphro dilemma"&lt;/a&gt; - the question whether something is good because God wills it or whether God wills it because it is good.  In the former, we get the repugnant conclusion that if God commands murder it is necessarily good (the good of a dictator).  In the latter, the good transcends God so we don't need God for the existence of the good.  The only way out of this dilemma that I have ever heard is the claim that "the standard of the Good is God’s very nature" (William Lane Craig) or something similar.  This seems to me to be word games to define your way out of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My final issue with the moral argument is that it seems to me that, like the argument from personal revelation, the argument itself relies on the &lt;em&gt;intuitive&lt;/em&gt; notion that there are some things that are &lt;em&gt;objectively&lt;/em&gt; wrong: things like murder and rape are objectively wrong, to deny this seems abhorrent, and everyone has this intuition.  Since, in other contexts (e.g. flat unmoving Earth), we have already seen that our intuitions fail in many situations, is it possible that it is failing here and we just don't see it?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore this line of thinking, one should notice that in the moral argument the usual extremes are always trotted out - murder and rape - and not something a bit more ambiguous. Since this argument holds a lot of emotional weight, perhaps we can explore this in a different way, and leave ourselves at least agnostic on this issue.  We have here some models of the source of morality - and I am neither promoting or denying any of these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Model 1: an external agent has imprinted some specific objective standards on everyone (perhaps imperfectly, like the sense of sight is imperfect). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Model 2: a naturalistic process is responsible for the &lt;em&gt;perceived&lt;/em&gt; standard through evolution. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Model 3: a naturalistic process is responsible for the standard (perceived or real) based on suffering/well being. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be others, but let's stick to these for a second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, all three models explain the &lt;em&gt;perception&lt;/em&gt; that murder and rape are objectively wrong. It would seem obvious from an evolutionary perspective that for social creatures, murder and rape would &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; objectively wrong. These three models all predict that we would have some divergence on more subtle issues, although I think not to the same degree. Model 1 would further imply that even on these more subtle aspects of morality there should eventually be convergence - the moral status of same-sex couples, for example. Models 2 and 3 would imply that there would be huge cultural differences between groups on the more subtle questions. Given our observations, this would seem to be evidence against Model 1 and the moral argument for God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In either case, if you have Models 1-3, a scientist would require further predictions that would help us actually distinguish between an agent-imparted standard and one without, even when both are consistent with our intuition about the extreme moral questions.  To say more would be presuming what the data would be without actually testing it.  We land, then, at least on the side of unconvinced but perhaps hopeful for the moral argument. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="human-purpose"&gt;Human purpose&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You and your beliefs are the product of a long chain of inevitable physical events. [...] It's all just a series of physical events - billiard balls bouncing off one another.  They aren't the least bit interested in the truth or falsity of the thoughts they are producing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the self-defeating nature of the naturalist worldview was a penny-dropping moment for me.  It meant that seeking meaning of any sort was a self-defeating enterprise for a thoroughgoing atheist.    Just as the collisions of the balls on the billiard-table only mean anything if there is a player who intended them to find a pocket, so we must be more than the matter that makes up our brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here again, I think Brierley is failing from a lack of imagination.  Meaning is a structure we attribute to actions and events in our lives. It seems to follow naturally from our pattern-seeking tendencies combined with our goals to increase well-being.  I find nothing too problematic with this view, even if we don't currently understand the detailed nature of consciousness.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a downside to notice for the "meaning from God" perspective, and that is the fact that the notion of eternal life in heaven makes &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; life not have any meaning, due to its finiteness.  Even if this life is supposedly a test for admission, the fact that the current life is &lt;em&gt;finite&lt;/em&gt; compared to the &lt;em&gt;infinite&lt;/em&gt; afterlife is enough to rob it of any significant meaning.  Clearly there are arguments on each side for this, but I just wanted to point out that it isn't completely clear even on the theistic perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="historical-arguments"&gt;Historical arguments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brierley nicely summarizes the historical arguments, both in the establishment of the existence of Jesus and the arguments of the Resurrection.  My largest concern with these arguments is the amount of trust that is placed in historical methods.  When confronted with the idea that we can't know the details of historical events to the level of repeatable, physical experiments, most people don't seem to take issue.  However, the claim that someone rose from the dead is something that - in a modern context - we'd want medical records, corroborating physical evidence, and we'd still be pretty skeptical that someone was putting us on.  Placing these events two thousand years ago, written decades after the events, by largely anonymous sources should make us &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; confident in the claim, not more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;minimal facts&lt;/em&gt; approach to the historicity of the Resurrection seems to be a major selling point for Christian apologists.  Although not a historian myself, I have read enough to see that this approach seems to never be used for any other historical event - why the special case?  I have personally found that &lt;a href="https://celsus.blog/2013/06/29/knocking-out-the-pillars-of-the-minimal-facts-apologetic/"&gt;the response by Matthew Ferguson&lt;/a&gt; - who is a historian - is as complete a response that one will ever find, and haven't seen anything even remotely convincing as a reply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-atheists-greatest-objection-suffering"&gt;The Atheist's Greatest Objection - Suffering&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll start my response here to point out that the argument from suffering is not the atheist's greatest objection.  &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRB0TDq8tWE"&gt;Like Matt Dillahunty&lt;/a&gt;, in my opinion the greatest objection to the theistic claim of the existence of God is from &lt;em&gt;hiddenness&lt;/em&gt;.  True to Brierley's form, he grapples well with all sides of the issue of suffering, bringing in all of the typical theistic counter arguments - but they are all indirect.  He implores us to appreciate how the preponderance of the other arguments for God "tips the scale towards belief in God."  He puts forward the idea that the objection is baseless because of the lack of objective morality under the atheist worldview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"it's  difficult to see how the reality of a world of moral right and wrong can exist in the absence of God. But the question being asked by the atheist is a fundamentally moral one."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He appeals to mystery,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"it is a mystery we believe will be answered in a day of final justice and joy when Jesus Christ sets the world to right."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and free will, hidden purpose of suffering, and an allegory.  Books have been written on this problem, and this chapter summarizes the topic nicely.  I am not moved by it because it feels to me - like all treatments of this topic - one excuse after another with nothing to pin it down.  As Sam Harris says, one can always answer the question "is suffering and evil consistent with God?" with a "yes" - the better question to ask is, "does the suffering we observe in the world &lt;em&gt;suggest&lt;/em&gt; there is an all-knowing, benevolent God?"  To that, the answer is clearly "no".  Sure!  You can always come up with reasons for the former, but the later is much clearer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hiddenness"&gt;Hiddenness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The really big objection, in my view, is hiddenness - the lack of obvious indicators of a divine presence.  If God actually wants a &lt;em&gt;relationship&lt;/em&gt; with people then God's lack of obvious existence is completely inconsistent with that, in a way that appealing to free will, the purpose of relationship, allegory and mystery just don't work.  If you look at nearly every one of my responses, it really comes down to not being convinced due to the lack of unambiguous evidence.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusions"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could go on with this review, but it is long enough as it is.  I applaud Brierley's efforts in summarizing 10 years of conversations on this topic.  I totally endorse his goal of improving conversation on difficult topics; and his tone in this book and the podcast should be a model for everyone.  Perhaps Brierley's book is just one more data point of confirmation bias, and perhaps my review is also.  How do we get past that?  The best way is to have the conversations, honestly and completely, and to constantly question your own perspective.  I want to thank Brierley for his fine work and hope he continues these efforts far into the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="religion"></category></entry><entry><title>A Cookbook Response to Jordan Peterson</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2018/May/22/a-cookbook-response-to-jordan-peterson/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-05-22T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-05-22T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2018-05-22:/posts/2018/May/22/a-cookbook-response-to-jordan-peterson/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've reproduced below Sam Harris' incredible example of interpreting texts.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://memoirsofanamnesic.wordpress.com/2010/07/01/interpreting-cain-and-abel-pt-i/"&gt;https://memoirsofanamnesic.wordpress.com/2010/07/01/interpreting-cain-and-abel-pt-i/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you read Harris' Cookbook exposition, you never see Peterson the same again.  Peterson claims that he only believes those interpretations that can be tied to four difference levels of understanding simultaneously, but I think that ends up being a smokescreen and that the same linguistic gymnastics can be done even in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="from-sam-harris-the-end-of-faith"&gt;From &lt;a href="https://samharris.org/books/the-end-of-faith/"&gt;Sam Harris, &lt;em&gt;The End of Faith&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with such hermeneutical efforts [...] is that they are perfectly unconstrained by the contents of the texts themselves. One can interpret every text in such a way as to yield almost any mystical or occult instruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A case in point: I have selected another book at random, this time from the cookbook aisle of a bookstore. The book is &lt;em&gt;A Taste of Hawaii: New Cooking from the Crossroads of the Pacific&lt;/em&gt;. Therein I have discovered an as yet uncelebrated mystical treatise. While it appears to be a recipe for wok-seared fish and shrimp cakes with ogo-tomato relish, we need only study its list of ingredients to know that we are in the presence of an unrivaled spiritual intelligence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;snapper filet, cubed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 teaspoons chopped scallions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;salt and freshly ground black pepper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a dash of cayenne pepper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 teaspoons chopped fresh ginger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 teaspoon minced garlic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8 shrimp, peeled, deveined, and cubed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1⁄2 cup heavy cream; 2 eggs, lightly beaten&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 teaspoons rice wine; 2 cups bread crumbs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 tablespoons vegetable oil; 2 1⁄2 cups ogo-tomato relish&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;snapper filet&lt;/em&gt;, of course, is the individual himself —you and I— awash in the sea of existence. But here we find it cubed, which is to say that our situation must be remedied in all three dimensions of body, mind, and spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Three teaspoons of chopped scallions&lt;/em&gt; further partakes of the cubic symmetry, suggesting that that which we need add to each level of our being by way of antidote comes likewise in equal proportions. The import of the passage is clear: the body, mind, and spirit need to be tended to with the same care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Salt and freshly ground black pepper&lt;/em&gt;: here we have the perennial invocation of opposites—the white and the black aspects of our nature. Both good and evil must be understood if we would fulfill the recipe for spiritual life. Nothing, after all, can be excluded from the human experience (this seems to be a Tantric text). What is more, salt and pepper come to us in the form of grains, which is to say that our good and bad qualities are born of the tiniest actions. Thus, we are not good or evil in general, but only by virtue of innumerable moments, which color the stream of our being by force of repetition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A dash of cayenne pepper&lt;/em&gt;: clearly, being of such robust color and flavor, this signifies the spiritual influence of an enlightened adept. What shall we make of the ambiguity of its measurement? How large is a dash? Here we must rely upon the wisdom of the universe at large. The teacher himself will know precisely what we need by way of instruction. And it is at just this point in the text that the ingredients that bespeak the heat of spiritual endeavor are added to the list—for after a dash of cayenne pepper, we find two teaspoons of chopped fresh ginger and one teaspoon of minced garlic. These form an isosceles trinity of sorts, signifying the two sides of our spiritual nature (male and female) united with the object meditation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next comes &lt;em&gt;eight shrimp—peeled, deveined, and cubed&lt;/em&gt;. The eight shrimp, of course, represent the eight worldly concerns that every spiritual aspirant must decry: fame and shame; loss and gain; pleasure and pain; praise and blame. Each needs to be deveined, peeled, and cubed— that is, purged of its power to entrance us and incorporated on the path of practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That such metaphorical acrobatics can be performed on almost any text—and that they are therefore meaningless—should be obvious.&lt;/p&gt;

Two questions were raised as evidence for God that I think are telling:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how do you get life from non-life?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how do you get the personal from the impersonal?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answers to these questions points to the properties of God, as traditionally understood.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first reaction is, even if we didn’t know the answers to these questions we would still not be in a position to make a positive claim for the explanation (e.g. God) without making the further step of obtaining evidence for the positive claim.  This is a God-of-the-Gaps move.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, although neither question is understood in sufficient detail, we have made substantial progress in understanding the &lt;a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/abioprob/"&gt;origin of life&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness#Scientific_study"&gt;origin of consciousness&lt;/a&gt;.  Far more progress than is made by assuming an agent simply created it.  We should avoid jumping to a positive claim without the evidence for that claim, and note our tendency to do just that in the face of mystery.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="religion"></category><category term="Unbelievable Project"></category><category term="religion"></category></entry><entry><title>Getting the Definitions Right</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2018/Feb/18/getting-the-definitions-right/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-02-18T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-02-18T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2018-02-18:/posts/2018/Feb/18/getting-the-definitions-right/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I posted before about  &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/3-reasons-why-belief-in-god-makes-sense.html"&gt;3 Reasons Why Belief in God Makes Sense&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="https://www.premierchristianradio.com/Shows/Saturday/Unbelievable" title="Unbelievable Podcast"&gt;Unbelievable Podcast&lt;/a&gt;.

In &lt;a href="https://www.christiantoday.com/article/3-reasons-im-not-an-atheist-and-im-still-a-christian/111411.htm"&gt;another article&lt;/a&gt;, Justin Brierley comments on some of his observations as the moderator of atheist-theist debates.  Some of his observations, unfortunately, are wrong.   For example,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Almost every atheist I meet wears the spectacles of 'naturalism'. It's the view that there is no supernatural dimension to existence. All that really exists is physical matter in motion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sounds suspiciously like “philosophical naturalism”, to which I know of &lt;em&gt;no one&lt;/em&gt; who ascribes.  There is &lt;em&gt;“methodological naturalism”&lt;/em&gt; which simply states that we may assume, for the moment as a practical matter, that there isn’t a supernatural realm.  We’ll continue to assume that until someone can demonstrate the supernatural.  This isn’t as much wearing “spectacles of ‘naturalism’” but the only pragmatic choice an honest inquiry can support.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way to look at it is to notice that science evaluates &lt;em&gt;well-defined claims&lt;/em&gt;. We know of no method which can handle non-well-defined claims and we have yet to see a &lt;em&gt;definition&lt;/em&gt; of supernatural that is well defined.   Is there one?  Until someone puts forward something useful, we can proceed without including it in our descriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Consequently, there is no realm of right or wrong to be discovered in life, no overarching purpose to things, no ultimate meaning to reach for in the universe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is also possibly wrong, and I dealt with it in the &lt;a href="https://bblais.github.io/3-reasons-why-belief-in-god-makes-sense.html"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;.  Even if you’re not convinced of this argument, you have to admit there is - for some people - a reasonable argument for morality under naturalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When BBC broadcaster and atheist scientist Jim Al-Khalili came on my Unbelievable? show he acknowledged: 'It's a huge philosophical question: why does nature speak the language of mathematics?'. Nobel Prize winning physicist Eugene Wigner termed it 'the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics', describing it as a 'wonderful gift we neither understand nor deserve’.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Are we to simply say 'pass' on this question?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this is a necessary fact?  Perhaps there is an explanation, but we don’t have access to it?  God, however, is no explanation.  As Robert Price notes, you’re trying to explain unknown X with unknown double-X!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our belief in the intrinsic dignity and worth of human beings is best explained by Christianity. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights tapped into a foundational view of humanity established by our Judeo-Christian heritage, one which we jettison at our peril. Our belief in the intrinsic value of humanity can't be explained by atheism. But if we are made in the image of God, as Christianity claims, then that gives every human being inestimable value.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except, the Bible itself clearly delineates superior and inferior people!  It specifies, in great detail, how one should treat slavery depending on whether they are the chosen people or not.  Furthermore, Jesus - despite some of his better messages - never speaks against that and tacitly endorses it with the &lt;a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/5-18.htm"&gt;“not one jot of the law will be abolished”&lt;/a&gt; statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All-in-all I find Justin’s claims here, despite his good intentions, to be a testament to confirmation bias - which perhaps I am suffering from as well?  How can I tell?  &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="religion"></category></entry><entry><title>3 Reasons Why Belief In God Makes Sense</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2018/Feb/06/3-reasons-why-belief-in-god-makes-sense/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-02-06T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-02-06T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2018-02-06:/posts/2018/Feb/06/3-reasons-why-belief-in-god-makes-sense/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In a new book, Justin Brierley of the very good &lt;a href="https://www.premierchristianradio.com/Shows/Saturday/Unbelievable" title="Unbelievable Podcast"&gt;Unbelievable Podcast&lt;/a&gt; writes about &lt;a href="https://www.premierchristianradio.com/Shows/Saturday/Unbelievable/Articles/3-Reasons-Why-Belief-In-God-Makes-Sense"&gt;3 Reasons Why Belief in God Makes Sense&lt;/a&gt;.

These reasons aren’t particularly compelling to me.  They are the following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="god-makes-sense-of-human-existence"&gt;God Makes Sense Of Human Existence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, Justin cites the Fine Tuning Argument, which has its best take-down in the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R97IHcuyWI0"&gt;Sean-Carroll/William Lane Craig debate&lt;/a&gt;.  It’s really an argument from physics, and the physics isn’t at all clear on whether the effect is there, or whether the interpretation of the effect is even reasonable.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="god-makes-sense-of-human-value"&gt;God Makes Sense Of Human Value&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, Justin states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why exactly do we believe that human life should be valued? Why did Jaime do the right thing – the human thing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find it very hard to come up with an answer on an atheistic world view. Why should humans have any more claim for special regard on the biological tree of life than a louse? There’s nothing intrinsically special about us in a universe that is blindly obeying the laws of nature. Any beliefs in objective human rights, values and morality are ultimately an illusion, a side-effect of our evolutionary history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I think &lt;a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/sam_harris_science_can_show_what_s_right"&gt;Sam Harris has the best word&lt;/a&gt; for this but &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq2C7fyVTA4"&gt;Matt Dillahunty also does quite well&lt;/a&gt; with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="god-makes-sense-of-human-purpose"&gt;God Makes Sense Of Human Purpose&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Justin states, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atheism and Christianity tell two very different stories – one is of ultimate purposelessness and the other is of ultimate hope. Hope that there is a reason for our existence, hope that our lives mean something, the hope that death is not the end. Is it a delusion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word “purpose” I think is a little less defined than I’d like, but it seems that if heaven exists then there really is no purpose for this life.  I am also not convinced that purpose requires an infinite time - that if you exist for a finite time then you can have purpose.  It may also be the case that there is no purpose - but how we feel about that should have no effect on the truth.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="religion"></category></entry><entry><title>Matter, Energy, and the Spirit</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2018/Jan/31/matter-energy-and-the-spirit/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-01-31T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-01-31T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2018-01-31:/posts/2018/Jan/31/matter-energy-and-the-spirit/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Theists seem to critique naturalism with the claim that there is more to the universe than just "matter and energy".

However, even physicists have in their models certain entities which cannot be categorized as either matter or energy. The quantum wavefunction is one clear example. There is also a history of introducing entities into models which later turn out to be unnecessary - "Vis viva" (i.e. life force), "phlogiston" (i.e. heat fluid), and "celestial matter" (vs terrestial matter). It is not that scientists are dogmatically against such entities, it's just that they should be dropped when they don't explain and predict anything or alternative explanations are simpler and more direct. We don't use agency to explain the motion of the planets anymore, for example, but we once did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other entities in models which serve as placeholders for the unknown, for example "dark matter". No one seriously thinks labeling the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_rotation_curve"&gt;gravitational effect observed from galactic rotation curves&lt;/a&gt; is better understood once we label it "dark matter". It is just a placeholder, until we figure out what dark matter actually is - neutrinos, black holes, altered gravitation on large scale, etc...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given this backdrop, what explanative and predictive power do the terms "spirit" and "supernatural agency" have anymore? Can we name anything that we understand better with their inclusion than we do without? What direct observations make these entities useful in any model of the universe, beyond as a placeholder for the unknown?  &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="religion"></category></entry><entry><title>Naturalism Defined</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2018/Jan/22/naturalism-defined/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-01-22T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-01-22T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2018-01-22:/posts/2018/Jan/22/naturalism-defined/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The question of supernatural vs. natural has come up a lot in discussions with Christians.

Such quotes as "&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalism_(philosophy)"&gt;Naturalism&lt;/a&gt; is ambiguous. What is nature and what isn't nature?", "Naturalism is vacuous. It's only tenet is an entirely reactionary one - no theology", and "Naturalism is unable to ground its own intelligibility which means it collapses into nihilism" abound.  Philosopher  Alvin Plantinga has an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_argument_against_naturalism"&gt;Evolutionary argument against naturalism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way I see it is the following.  There used to be a distinction between "terrestrial" and "celestial" matter. Then it was determined that the planets obeyed the same rules as the apples falling from trees and the need for the distinction disappeared. "Celestial" matter disappeared as did "terrestrial" matter leaving just "matter". Since then, we have determined, that pretty much everything we can observe follows the same rules - although some get blurred at different scales (microscopic vs macroscopic, for example). Naturalism then is simply the recognition that the stuff we see day-to-day operates on the same principles as the stars in the early universe, and the galaxies far far away. So if you can show us something that is observable yet doesn't follow these rules - something which follows a separate set of rules - then perhaps it might be time to introduce the distinction between natural and supernatural. Otherwise, there is no need for the added concept of the supernatural. Is there such an observable? What are its rules?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a side-note, this means that naturalism need not "ground its own intelligibility". It is just the recognition that we can develop rules using the material on the Earth and make predictions over a wide range of time and space. There really isn't anything more we could ask of it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="religion"></category></entry><entry><title>Where probabilities and theology meet</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2018/Jan/09/where-probabilities-and-theology-meet/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-01-09T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-01-09T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Brian Blais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2018-01-09:/posts/2018/Jan/09/where-probabilities-and-theology-meet/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;We start with the article &lt;a href="https://calumsblog.com/2012/02/18/resurrection-for-theism/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why the resurrection data can be evidence for theism, and why arguments for resurrection need not presuppose theism – formal demonstrations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We start with the article &lt;a href="https://calumsblog.com/2012/02/18/resurrection-for-theism/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why the resurrection data can be evidence for theism, and why arguments for resurrection need not presuppose theism –
formal demonstrations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="summary-of-the-article"&gt;Summary of the article&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(T\)&lt;/span&gt; = theism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(R\)&lt;/span&gt; = the resurrection of Jesus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(D\)&lt;/span&gt; = specific historical data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some definitions, and initial probability assessments.  The numbers are not meant to be precise but to convey overall qualitative estimates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(T) \ge 0.01\)&lt;/span&gt; which includes natural theology &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(\sim T) = 1- P(T) \le 0.99\)&lt;/span&gt; - prior on atheism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(R|T) \approx 0.0001\)&lt;/span&gt; - unlikely but not extraordinarily so&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(R|\sim T) \approx 0.00000001\)&lt;/span&gt; - very unlikely&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(D|R) \approx 0.75\)&lt;/span&gt; - relatively high&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(D|\sim R) \approx 0.00000001\)&lt;/span&gt; - very unlikely&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now some calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Probability of the data on atheism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
P(D|\sim T) &amp;amp;=&amp;amp; P(D| \sim T \cdot R)P(R|\sim T)+P(D| \sim T \cdot \sim R)P(\sim R|\sim T) \\
&amp;amp;=&amp;amp; 0.75 \cdot 0.00000001 + 0.00000001 \cdot 0.999999999 \\
&amp;amp;=&amp;amp;0.00000007501
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Probability of the data on theism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
P(D|T) &amp;amp;=&amp;amp; P(D| T \cdot R)P(R|T)+P(D|T \cdot \sim R)P(\sim R|T) \\
&amp;amp;=&amp;amp; 0.75 \cdot 0.0001 + 0.00000001 \cdot 0.9999 \\
&amp;amp;=&amp;amp;0.00007501
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From which follows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
P(T|D) &amp;amp;=&amp;amp; \frac{P(D|T)P(T)}{P(D|T)P(T)+P(D|\sim T)P(\sim T)} \\
&amp;amp;=&amp;amp;\frac{0.0000751 \cdot 0.01}{0.0000751 \cdot 0.01 + 0.0000000751 \cdot 0.99} \\
&amp;amp;=&amp;amp;0.977
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
where the prior probability for theism was &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(T)=0.01\)&lt;/span&gt; - definitely an increase in probability given the data!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point of this argument is to "&lt;em&gt;serve as a rejoinder to those philosophers of religion who do not see the argument from miracles as supporting theism at all, or who think that one need to presuppose theism to argue for a miracle&lt;/em&gt;".  Further, "&lt;em&gt;I am not intending to argue that the probabilities given at the start are correct, only that it is in principle very much possible for one to argue to theism from miracle evidence&lt;/em&gt;" and "&lt;em&gt;that it is also possible to argue for a particular miracle without presupposing theism.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="two-concerns-with-this-argument"&gt;Two concerns with this argument&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lack-of-well-defined-propositions"&gt;Lack of well-defined propositions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probability theory only applies to well-defined propositions.  Something like &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(T)\)&lt;/span&gt; may not mean anything if the proposition &lt;em&gt;theism is true&lt;/em&gt;, shortened to &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(T\)&lt;/span&gt; is not well defined.  If we are opening it up to all possible theisms, then we have to include deism, good gods, evil gods (think Cthulhu), chaotic gods (think Zeus), multiple gods (think Hinduism), gods as nature (think paganism), etc...  It is unclear to me that, if you include all of that, that you can easily estimate &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(T)\)&lt;/span&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, quantities such as &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(R|T)\)&lt;/span&gt; become much lower if you include all of those other pieces of theism, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(T\)&lt;/span&gt;.  I may in the future go through the calculation explicitely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lack-of-a-connection-from-data-to-propositions"&gt;Lack of a connection from data to propositions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What counts as "data" here and how does it connect to the propositions?  For example, the only "data" I know concerning the resurrection are &lt;em&gt;claims&lt;/em&gt; from people, &lt;em&gt;years&lt;/em&gt; (possibly decades) after the event, from non eye-witnesses.  So when Calum writes &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(D|\sim R) \approx 0.00000001\)&lt;/span&gt;  (very unlikely), he is clearly wrong.  This sort of terrible evidence for the event is exactly what we'd expect if the event didn't happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also part of the "data" has to be what we &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; see - official reports from Romans, mentions (either positive or negative) from contemporaries, physical evidence of &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; kind, etc...  When Calum states something like &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(D|R) \approx 0.75\)&lt;/span&gt; (very likely), he isn't taking this into account at all.  If the resurrection had actually happened, and the body was in fact missing from a guarded tomb, I would expect Paul to mention it and the trials in Acts to mention it.  Here, the missing data works &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; the claim and the proposed probabilities.  &lt;/p&gt;
