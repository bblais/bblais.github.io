&lt;p&gt;Here is the summary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He …&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A short video by Fr. Robert Barron, to start off the new year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zMf_8hkCdc&amp;amp;w=560&amp;amp;h=315]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the summary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He starts by referring to what "serious theists" think about the
    word "God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Points out that many use the word very differently, calling
    attention to differences between the usage by atheists and those by
    "serious" theists&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He talks about the "genus of being", and that atheists believe that
    God is the supreme instance of that...but that is exactly what God
    is not...according to Aquinas, God is not a being, a thing, or
    individual&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He is the "subsistent act of to-be itself", the "great ocean of
    existence from which the world in its entirety comes"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;he contrasts this with gods, which are the supreme existence of
    being, and exist within nature...God does not exist within Nature&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"The sciences in principle cannot eliminate God, because God is not
    an item within the natural world.  God is not some event or
    phenomenon which can be examined by the physical sciences."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He claims that you don't produce evidence for the creator of the
    universe, like you would for Yeti...this is a category error.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"authentic religion" begins with the extraordinary experience of the
    contingency of the world - the deep intuition that the world exists
    by doesn't have to exist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"We know there is some reality whose very nature is 'to be' -  that
    infinite source of reality that grounds and gives rise to the whole
    nexus of conditioned things...in you we live and move and have our
    being...that's God."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He ends with criticizing atheists for suggesting that the universe
    pops out of nothing, and accusing theists of magical thinking.  He
    accuses atheists of dropping the question (claiming "I don't know")
    when the question gets really interesting - why is there something
    rather than nothing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a number of responses to parts of this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He claims that Aquinas is particularly clear, and then quotes
    Aquinas as saying that God is the "subsistent act of to-be itself"
    amongst other things.  Sorry, that's word soup, and doesn't mean
    anything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He is correct that science cannot disprove such a nebulous
    definition of God.  If everyone simply took this definition, and
    went no further, they'd be deists.  If every religious person became
    a deists, the atheists would have no work to do.  The problem is
    that religious people do not stop with deism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If God isn't a "being", then what does it mean for God to speak to
    people?   What does it mean for God to be three persons?  What does
    it mean for God to intercede in the world?  A personal God?  I think
    this guy believes, when convenient, in nebulous deism and, when
    convenient, medieval and Bronze age superstition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"We know there is some reality whose very nature is 'to be' -  that
    infinite source of reality that grounds and gives rise to the whole
    nexus of conditioned things...in you we live and move and have our
    being...that's God."  - Notice how easily he moves from nearly
    content-free deepity speak, and then slides in "...in you..."
    implying a mind, a person, a relationship.  This is the jump where
    he is claiming to know things he cannot know.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'd further add that the entire claim in the previous point is
    something he cannot know.  He refers to philosophical &lt;em&gt;intuition&lt;/em&gt; of
    the contingency of everything (including the universe) but has not
    demonstrated it to be true.  Until then, "I don't know" is the
    proper response.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The only reason anyone speaks like this at all is because religion
    has lost its authority on nearly every level (medicine, history,
    astronomy, physics, biology, etc...), so that no one can take the
    stories seriously anymore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just because something lies outside of nature, if it affects nature
    at all it can be tested.  This has been done with "miracle" claims
    (healings, visions, resurrections, etc...), efficacy of prayer, and
    models of the cosmos - and they have been all shown to be wanting.
     Thus, it reduces the probability of this interventionist God claim.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to retreat to a non-interventionist God, in principle immune
from science, no problem...but stop claiming that that is somehow a
victory.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="wordpress_migration"></category><category term="Religion"></category></entry><entry><title>Religion and the Illusion of Moral Authority</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Dec/18/religion-and-the-illusion-of-moral-authority/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-12-18T14:06:00-05:00</published><updated>2013-12-18T14:06:00-05:00</updated><author><name>brianblais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2013-12-18:/posts/2013/Dec/18/religion-and-the-illusion-of-moral-authority/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This post in response to a &lt;a href="http://brianblais.wordpress.com/2013/12/01/a-story-of-humanity/#comments"&gt;comment I received about the source of

morality in society&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I realize religion, even with its negatives, remains a net
positive in human endeavors because it supplies something that cannot
be supplied by any other…a body of moral precepts that humans can
rally around and use to guide behavior in society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't believe this, and neither do most people if they thought about
it for a little while.  On a practical level, how do we figure out what
is good and what is bad?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's focus just on the Christian message, which is informed from the
moral statements in the Bible.  This includes things like the Golden
Rule, the Sermon on the Mount, and the Ten Commandments...or does it?
 Here are a few quotes from the Bible, both Old and New Testament, and I
ask which ones are good and bad, and how do you know?:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deuteronomy 22:20-1 If, however, the charge is true and no proof of
the girl’s virginity can be found, she shall be brought to the door of
her father’s house and there the men of her town shall stone her to
death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deuteronomy 20: However, in the cities of the nations the Lord your
God is giving you as an inheritance, do not leave alive anything that
breathes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exodus 21:20-21 If a man beats his male or female slave with a rod and
the slave dies as a direct result, he must be punished, but he is not
to be punished if the slave gets up after a day or two, since the
slave is his property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Peter 2:18 Slaves, submit yourselves to your masters with all
respect, not only to those who are good and considerate, but also to
those who are harsh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 5: 31 “It has been said, ‘Anyone who divorces his wife must
give her a certificate of divorce.’  But I tell you that anyone who
divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, makes her the victim
of adultery, and anyone who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leviticus 24:16 “And he that blasphemeth the name of the Lord, he
shall surely be put to death”  - penalty for breaking one of the ten
commandments&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.5;"&gt;Matthew 12:32 “Whosoever speaketh
against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this
world, neither in the world to come”. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.5;"&gt;Now, I am not making any claims here that
any of these are good or bad (although personally, I do have opinions on
them).  What I am saying is that people look at some of these and say
they are bad, some are just fine, but &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;whatever reason people
use, they aren't using the religion as the authority to
decide&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.5;"&gt;.  That's the point.  People
already pick and choose messages from the Bible, taking some of the more
unpleasant things as anachronistic or metaphorical, other unpleasant
things as exaggerations, and keeping the seemingly good things.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.5;"&gt;In all of this, the religion isn't the
thing giving them guidance in their moral decisions.  The religion is
simply giving a vocabulary to summarize the moral perspective someone
has for non-religious reasons, in much the same way that the
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bartleby.com/119/1.html"&gt;Robert Frost poem "The Road Not
Taken"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.5;"&gt; summarizes the feeling many
have of being better choosing a more difficult path in life.  However,
we come to that feeling for "non-Frostian" reasons.  It could even be
said that for some, reading the Frost poem motivates them to see value
in a difficult decision.  However, there is something "non-Frostian"
motivating the decision to draw inspiration from this poem, and not
another one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can take our moral messages from many sources, and in practice we do
that.  Although many people claim that religion gives us our morality,
or moral guidance, in reality it does nothing of the sort.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="wordpress_migration"></category><category term="Religion"></category></entry><entry><title>A story of humanity...</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Dec/01/a-story-of-humanity/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-12-01T00:03:00-05:00</published><updated>2013-12-01T00:03:00-05:00</updated><author><name>brianblais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2013-12-01:/posts/2013/Dec/01/a-story-of-humanity/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Carolyn Porco always finds a way to inspire...&lt;/p&gt;

Church&lt;/a&gt;, but could well be from any Christian Church):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trinity is One. We do not confess …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I hear things like this (taken from the &lt;a href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_P17.HTM#1FT"&gt;Catechism of the Catholic
Church&lt;/a&gt;, but could well be from any Christian Church):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trinity is One. We do not confess three Gods, but one God in three
persons, the "consubstantial Trinity".83 The divine persons do not
share the one divinity among themselves but each of them is God whole
and entire: "The Father is that which the Son is, the Son that which
the Father is, the Father and the Son that which the Holy Spirit is,
i.e. by nature one God."84 In the words of the Fourth Lateran Council
(1215), "Each of the persons is that supreme reality, viz., the divine
substance, essence or nature."85&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;254 The divine persons are really distinct from one another. "God is
one but not solitary."86 "Father", "Son", "Holy Spirit" are not simply
names designating modalities of the divine being, for they are really
distinct from one another: "He is not the Father who is the Son, nor
is the Son he who is the Father, nor is the Holy Spirit he who is the
Father or the Son."87 They are distinct from one another in their
relations of origin: "It is the Father who generates, the Son who is
begotten, and the Holy Spirit who proceeds."88 The divine Unity is
Triune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what I hear:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}
a&amp;amp;=&amp;amp;b=c\\
a&amp;amp;\neq&amp;amp; b\\
a&amp;amp;\neq&amp;amp; c\\
c&amp;amp;\neq&amp;amp; b&lt;br&gt;
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then when I hear a Christian say something like this, which was on
the Unbelievable Facebook forum,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We [...] stress the Trinity a lot, not only because we think it is
true but because it explains some things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one thing, it means that the ideas of personal relationship and
love are built into existence and have always been. For another it
helps us understand how God can be completely transcendent (the
Father) and yet reveal Himself to us (via the Word and Spirit).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I hear is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We [...] stress the X a lot, Not only do I think&lt;br&gt;
\begin{eqnarray}
a&amp;amp;=&amp;amp;b=c\\
a&amp;amp;\neq&amp;amp; b\\
a&amp;amp;\neq&amp;amp; c\\
c&amp;amp;\neq&amp;amp; b&lt;br&gt;
\end{eqnarray}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is true, but it explains a number of things. For one thing, it means
that  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So where am I going wrong here? Where does the analogy break? If you say
that the Trinity is a "mystery", that is simply an admission that the
Trinity is incoherent. If you say that I am not using the word "is"
correctly, then please enlighten me as to the proper definition, but
make sure it is well defined.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="wordpress_migration"></category><category term="Religion"></category></entry><entry><title>Science as Entertainment</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Nov/12/science-as-entertainment/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-11-12T13:30:00-05:00</published><updated>2013-11-12T13:30:00-05:00</updated><author><name>brianblais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2013-11-12:/posts/2013/Nov/12/science-as-entertainment/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This past weekend I was at a Girl Scouts "Mad Science" program, not as

an instructor but as a parent.  There was a lot of interesting things
presented, and the girls all seemed to have a good time, but I
constantly felt that there was little real science being done.  I've had
that feeling with some "science" shows on television, and this was
another example of what I think of as "Science as Entertainment": lots
of cool-wow eye candy, but little content.  Now, I recognize there are
some real constraints in doing programs like this, and I don't want to
be negative, so I've been thinking of ways to improve a program like
this.  Some of the constraints are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you don't often have scientists running the individual activities,
    even if you might have a scientist organize it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the people running the activities are either older girl scouts or
    parents who are scout leaders - thus, there needs to be a bit of a
    script to follow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you need to have the eye-candy to keep some interest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you have limited time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given these constraints, I'd offer this major suggestion:  the
activities should start with a small cool-wow demo, followed by a
question like "I wonder how this works?" or "I wonder what this is
sensitive to?".  Then do a followup activity (or more) where one
addresses these questions, always focussing on the "how do we know what
we know?" overarching theme.
 &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline;"&gt;That's what science is really
about!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me give some specific examples, taken from the activities actually
done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="static-electricity-demo"&gt;Static Electricity Demo&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this activity, the scouts did a number of observations of static,
including rubbing balloons in the hair and picking up pepper, attracting
ping-pong balls, and sticking the balloon to the wall.  Although all
cool, it would be good to start with one, and ask "what's going on
here?"  The example which was missing here is the &lt;em&gt;repulsion&lt;/em&gt; from the
charge, giving the impression that static is always attractive.  All it
would take is to put two balloons together (or try!) and see that they
don't &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; each other...this leads to the two-charge model.  One could
even add/replace one of the activities with the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_electricity#Charged_adhesive_tape"&gt;scotch-tape
version&lt;/a&gt; of the experiment, and then ask if the charge on the balloon
is the same/different than the scotch tape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="making-bubbles"&gt;Making Bubbles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the scouts made a bubble mixture from household ingredients (i.e.
dish soap, corn syrup, etc...), took them outside and played with
bubbles for a while.  A good question would be "which ingredient gives
which property?"  With all the scouts there, throughout the morning, one
could do a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of trial and error, even make it a contest for the
biggest bubble, the longest lasting bubble, etc...  Does dish soap work
alone?  Does corn syrup work alone?  Why do both work?  One could tie
this to a TV show like &lt;a href="http://www.americastestkitchen.com/"&gt;America's Test Kitchen&lt;/a&gt;, where they do tests
like this all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="balance"&gt;Balance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, there was a series of gravity-type experiments with free-fall, but
then at the end they did an activity about balance: leaning against a
wall with your right shoulder and head, and trying to lift your left
leg.  Again, the sorts of questions that one could follow with is "why
is it hard to lift your leg?", "under what conditions would this be
true?", "could you come up with another pose that does something
similar?", etc...  Personally, this would be a awesome place to do the
&lt;a href="http://youtu.be/Piu75P8sxTo?t=2m30s"&gt;energy bracelet demo&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusions"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each case, the point is to do a demo, ask some leading questions
related to "how do we know what we know", and structure the activities
to answer the questions.  I would also add that the person overseeing
the activities should be encouraged to say "I don't know", and to know
that it is a perfectly fine answer.  It should be followed up by a, "I
wonder how we could figure out" statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The danger in presenting science and anything that looks/sounds sciency
without any content is is primes kids to accept the latest
pseudoscience, just because it sounds technical.  It also makes kids
start thinking that science is just about the technicalities, and not
about the general questions relating to knowledge and belief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another danger is that several times I heard an "explanation" of what
was going on in the activity that did not really match what was actually
observed.  I know this is from following a script, but it is very
damaging. It gives kids the impression that one should believe in
science authorities, even in the face of contrary evidence.  It also
increases confusion about what is actually happening.  Cases like this
should bring up the idea of repeatability, variability, and careful
measurements.  A response like this would be more appropriate:
"hmmm...that's odd, I don't know why it isn't working like I think it
should...how can we figure this out?" Even if there is no time, or
equipment, to do the proper job it is still useful to outline how
one &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; do it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="wordpress_migration"></category></entry><entry><title>Knowledge, Faith, and Belief</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Oct/24/knowledge-faith-and-belief/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-10-24T19:30:00-04:00</published><updated>2013-10-24T19:30:00-04:00</updated><author><name>brianblais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2013-10-24:/posts/2013/Oct/24/knowledge-faith-and-belief/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Words have meaning, and if we are going to communicate with each other

we need to make sure to use words as carefully as we can.  Otherwise,
misunderstandings abound.  It seems very common that a word like "faith"
is used by different people for different ends, and the definition
shifts even within an argument.  Take for example, this video:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UH8np-WBa_o"&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UH8np-WBa_o&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here there is a distinction drawn between "faith" and "belief", using an
analogy of a roller-coaster - belief in the ride being safe vs trusting
it being safe enough to ride on.  As with many things, I find it far
more useful to describe terms in probabilistic vocabulary.  Let's start
with belief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We say we believe a proposition A when P(A)&amp;gt;0.5.  We say we believe
&lt;em&gt;strongly&lt;/em&gt; in a proposition A when P(A)&amp;gt;0.95 or some other, somewhat
arbitrary, high number.  The strength of a belief is a &lt;em&gt;scale&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is knowledge?  I've heard philosophers give the following
definition of knowledge:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowledge is justified true belief. [note: bad definition, IMO]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not satisfied with this definition because, it seems to me that, in
order to justifiably label anything as &lt;em&gt;knowledge&lt;/em&gt; with this definition
we'd need to be able to independently determine that the proposition is
true.  This  presupposes that there is some "outside" knowledge, which I
feel comes too close to assuming a religious justification.  I do
believe that there is probably a truth to be known, but that we can
never truly know what it is for certain - but this is not a problem.  It
is a red herring to bring up 100% certainty for knowledge, because it is
never achievable, and isn't what we practically call knowledge.  I
prefer a definition inspired by Stephen J Gould:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In science, 'fact' can only mean 'confirmed to such a degree that it
would be perverse to withhold provisional assent.' I suppose that
apples might start to rise tomorrow, but the possibility does not
merit equal time in physics classrooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where it says "fact", read "knowledge".  Where it says "science" read
"life".  We label things as knowledge in our lives when they are
"confirmed to such a degree that it would be perverse to withhold
provisional assent."  Thus, &lt;em&gt;P(A)&amp;gt;0.9999 \~ 1&lt;/em&gt;.  Notice that we don't
need 100% certainty to claim knowledge, and that it is possible for the
"knowledge" to be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about faith?  Is faith "belief without evidence", as atheists like
to suggest?  Is it "trust", as in the video above?  We could start with
the Biblical reference,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrews 11:1, “Now faith is confidence in what we hope for and
assurance about what we do not see.” [NIV]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which I read as a synonym for "wishful thinking".  Others may read it as
"trust".  Still others as "belief without evidence", and perhaps there
are more.  The problem here is that it doesn't have a clear definition,
so it fails in its usefulness.  What are people really claiming here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's go back to the roller-coaster example.  I would submit that, in
this case, strong belief must be a prerequisite to "faith" in the sense
he's using it.  If you don't believe the roller-coaster is safe, or you
don't believe the roller-coaster exists, then you cannot have trust it
in.  Once you believe it is safe, do you trust it to ride?  This brings
in decision theory, where we mix probabilities with utility measures.
 You could believe it to be safe at the &lt;em&gt;P(&lt;/em&gt;safe&lt;em&gt;)=0.9&lt;/em&gt; level, but still
not trust it "with your life" because of the &lt;em&gt;cost&lt;/em&gt; associated with
being wrong.  So trust requires  both belief and a sufficiently positive
net utility.  Placed in these terms it is much more clear how the
argument is set up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when the religious say that "faith" is like "trust", they are
    already approaching the problem with strong belief, and are
    assessing utility - and they rightly claim that belief is not
    enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when the atheists say that "faith" is "belief without evidence",
    they are addressing the strength of the evidence to obtain strong
    belief - and saying that it is not sufficient.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when the religious say that "faith is rational" they are either
    talking about utility, not belief, or they are claiming that the
    evidence is in fact good enough for strong belief, and then
    consequently high utility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all cases, it seems as if for the religious, utility and belief are
muddled when using the word "faith".  For the atheist, "faith" is always
about belief.  Perhaps if we ditch the term "faith" altogether and focus
on what we're actually claiming it would make communication a lot
easier!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="wordpress_migration"></category></entry><entry><title>Nobel Prize - The "Higgs" and Predictions</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Oct/09/nobel-prize-the-higgs-and-predictions/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-10-09T16:57:00-04:00</published><updated>2013-10-09T16:57:00-04:00</updated><author><name>brianblais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2013-10-09:/posts/2013/Oct/09/nobel-prize-the-higgs-and-predictions/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So around 50 years ago a number of scientists made a prediction for an

unseen particle (typically referred to as the 'Higgs boson' but also
sometimes as the 'God particle' - a silly name if I ever heard one)
which, if it existed, [helped to fill in an explanation of the
fundamental laws of the universe][].  It took 50 years, thousands of
people, and millions of dollars to directly confirm this prediction
but&lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-18702455"&gt;it was done last year&lt;/a&gt;...and thus is &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/09/science/englert-and-higgs-win-nobel-physics-prize.html"&gt;deserving of a Nobel
Prize&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nobel Prize can only be give to at most three scientists, so the
letter-of-the-law committee &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/peter-higgs-francois-englert-win-nobel-prize-in-physics/2013/10/08/1d96aa72-2f98-11e3-8906-3daa2bcde110_story.html"&gt;omitted three other scientists&lt;/a&gt; who also
contributed to this prediction.  I had the fortune to take high energy
physics with one of these, Prof Gerry Guralnik, at Brown University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To think that we, as a species, are able to predict something so subtle
in the universe, decades before our ability to actually confirm it, is
truly astounding.  In times like this I have a feeling of optimism for
our species, an awe for the amazing structure in the universe that we
have uncovered, and an excitement for the things that we have yet to
discover.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="wordpress_migration"></category><category term="Science"></category></entry><entry><title>The Fallacy of All-Natural</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Sep/26/the-fallacy-of-all-natural/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-09-26T14:33:00-04:00</published><updated>2013-09-26T14:33:00-04:00</updated><author><name>brianblais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2013-09-26:/posts/2013/Sep/26/the-fallacy-of-all-natural/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was&lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jj-keith/vaccines_b_3829948.html"&gt;reading an article&lt;/a&gt; about the anti-vaccine movement, encouraging

one seems to know quite how it will play out.  After sitting in on
several of these, I've come to find (at least for me) that they are the
treadmill of education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try to keep up a running schedule, which I've been able to do during
the spring and summer, but have always fallen off the wagon in the
winter.  In the winter, the dark and the cold makes it hard to run
outside and the academic schedule makes it hard to run during the
daylight hours.  I hope to overcome this, but it means running more on
my treadmill (which I have).  The difference between running outside and
running on a treadmill is psychological - if you run a mile and don't
feel up to the second mile you can get off the treadmill and go back
upstairs for a break.  The same thing happens with a MOOC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've "attended" a few of these classes, but never really finished.  This
is due to time and motivation, because the classes generally were pretty
good.  However, given pressing time of things that I &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to do, it is
hard to push my way through assignments that I might &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; to do.  In
addition, I find it hard to find time to sit and watch a video, instead
of reading or listening to audio books, seminars and podcasts which are
all more convenient (at least for me).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this is my particular failing, but I wonder how common this
perspective is.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="wordpress_migration"></category></entry><entry><title>What to do when you're not an expert</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Sep/19/what-to-do-when-youre-not-an-expert/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-09-19T10:47:00-04:00</published><updated>2013-09-19T10:47:00-04:00</updated><author><name>brianblais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2013-09-19:/posts/2013/Sep/19/what-to-do-when-youre-not-an-expert/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I was listening to the very interesting discussion between William

in modern science sounds crazy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what do I do?  Mine is closer to Craig's, but I take it a step
further.  When I hear a claim, I try to find someone claiming the polar
opposite.  I then read each of their supporting arguments, and the
refutations of the other sides.  I look, then, for a specific claim that
each side disagrees with, but can be easily checked - and I try to check
it.  This usually involves going back and forth between the two sides a
bit, because of the qualifications to the arguments.  Someone claims
that the Bible condones slavery, another doesn't.  I hear the quotes
from each side, and the context, and then I go to the text to look at a
couple of the passages - the ones I think are most critical.  I may then
go back to the arguments, to see if what they are saying matches what I
read, etc...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also look at the style of the arguments.  One of the reasons I switch
from being a global warming alarmist to a luke-warmist was because of
climateaudit.org.  I could tell that they made a big deal about putting
the data up, and turn-key scripts to do the analysis, so it was
completely straightforward to check every step.  I didn't need to check
every step myself, but the effort to make things transparent was quite
evident.  If I see people dodging the meat of a challenge, or not being
transparent, or engaging in special pleading, I need not have to
evaluate the argument in quite so much detail to be reasonably convinced
that there is a problem with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the habit of examining the opposing view, even - and especially
- when you agree with the original view is extremely important, and
something that many do not do.  They follow blogs that agree with them
only, read newspapers that agree with their point of view, listen to
podcasts that agree with them, etc...  That's one of the reasons I
really like the &lt;a href="http://www.premierradio.org.uk/shows/saturday/unbelievable.aspx"&gt;Unbelievable podcast&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="wordpress_migration"></category></entry><entry><title>Origins of Religion - Two Hypotheses</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Sep/13/origins-of-religion-two-hypotheses/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-09-13T09:30:00-04:00</published><updated>2013-09-13T09:30:00-04:00</updated><author><name>brianblais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2013-09-13:/posts/2013/Sep/13/origins-of-religion-two-hypotheses/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In one of &lt;a href="http://donjohnsonministries.org/the-don-johnson-show-2/"&gt;Don Johnson's podcasts&lt;/a&gt;, he gave some "data" which he

claims is supported by the theistic worldview and not the atheistic
worldview.  The points he raises are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;everyone has a moral code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;all cultures have essential monotheism (one main creator god, with
    lesser gods) and that humans are separated from the creator god&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no atheist cultures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't done the research to confirm point (2), so I'll accept it for
the sake of argument.  Points (1) and (3) I think are almost certainly
true (there are some exceptions for point (1) - sociopaths).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what would an atheistic explanation for this data?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​1. The moral code is exactly what one would expect for social
creatures, developed through a blind process of evolution.  Social
creatures, by definition, need to work together to survive.  Thus,
concepts such as fairness, supporting the weak members of the group,
caring for others, etc... would be a direct consequence of this process.
 We'd also expect a conflict between biological drives for individual vs
group survival, variation in the altruism of the members,  and evidence
of moral behavior in our nearest social species - all of which can be
seen experimentally.  If this code is something uniquely human, which
the theists claim, then we shouldn't see it in other animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​2. Answering a question with a question: how many societies have there
been without a hierarchical governing organization?  It seems clear to
me that the structure of monotheism matches pretty well the development
of human cultures and the organization of those cultures.  As they say
on the &lt;a href="http://freethoughtblogs.com/reasonabledoubts"&gt;Reasonable Doubts podcast&lt;/a&gt;, "God thinks like you".  I'd also
add that, unless you had a totally democratic pantheon, you'd end up
with one "most powerful" god, and probably fall under Johnson's
"essential" monotheism.  In other words, the category of "essential
monotheism" may include nearly every possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​3. Atheism is not obvious, and we have a biological tendency to agency
detection.  In addition, science is hard.  It takes work to be
skeptical, against our many biases, etc...  Finally, apparent design in
biology is so obvious that without the theory of evolution, the belief
in divine design is a completely reasonable position.  Darwin did not
disprove God, but he made it possible to be an intellectually consistent
atheist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I think these responses are far more compelling than:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​1. God gave us a moral code (even with the inconsistencies between
individuals, and the immoral actions condoned and commanded in the
Bible)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​2. All cultures believe in God , therefore it is true (even with the
inconsistencies between the different depictions of God, and the
observations that all cultures have had witchcraft without that being
true)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​3. There are no atheist cultures because God is so obvious to everyone
(even though when we actually start figuring out how things really work,
God gets less and less obvious).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="wordpress_migration"></category></entry><entry><title>The Supernatural and the History of Cosmology</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Sep/04/the-supernatural-and-the-history-of-cosmology/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-09-04T20:20:00-04:00</published><updated>2013-09-04T20:20:00-04:00</updated><author><name>brianblais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2013-09-04:/posts/2013/Sep/04/the-supernatural-and-the-history-of-cosmology/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I hold the view that the term "supernatural" is simply an incoherent

concept. No one has been able to demonstrate that that the set of
"supernatural" things is not empty, or how you would be able to tell!
 Still, if we presume that there is a coherent definition, and there is
at least one thing in that set, and that one thing is a god which can
interact with the world, then at least the effects should be testable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was thinking about this term "supernatural" recently, and it occurred
to me that this term is really a label-of-the-gaps and, because the only
denizen of the supernatural is purported to be God: the term
"supernatural" is a mask for the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_the_gaps"&gt;God of the gaps&lt;/a&gt;.  This came to me
when I realized that the ancient Christians did not believe in the
supernatural!  Their cosmology was weird (by modern standards), where
they imagined different materials - both earthly and heavenly.  Thus,
God was in what they would call the universe, but located within a
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Heavens"&gt;divine part of the universe&lt;/a&gt; (somewhere within the Moon and the other
planets).  See a few ancient writings, like the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascension_of_Isaiah"&gt;Ascension of Isaiah&lt;/a&gt;,
for a tour.  One of the issues the Church had with Galileo was that,
with his telescope, it became clear that the Moon looked just like an
ordinary rock and not something perfect, made of divine materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we falsified the ancient cosmology, the "heavens" had to move
somewhere else. Essentially, it has to move beyond where we can directly
observe, which inconveniently for the theists, is nearly everywhere
these days.  Thus, the only place to go is the (undefined) region of the
"supernatural".  Notice that the influence of God has also followed this
 path, with the &lt;a href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Scientific_evidence_for_God's_existence"&gt;strongest arguments for God&lt;/a&gt; lurking in the ultimate
origin of the universe (through the so-called fine-tuning of the
physical constants), the origin of life (not the development of species,
because once the first replicator is formed, evolution explains the
resulting diversity), and ancient history (because modern history
doesn't show the evidence of God's influence) - all out of reach of our
current access to data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So , when theists toss around the term "supernatural", we can recognize
it for what it is - a simple statement of ignorance, and another facet
of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_the_gaps"&gt;God-of-the-Gaps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="wordpress_migration"></category></entry><entry><title>God in the head</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Sep/02/god-in-the-head/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-09-02T12:08:00-04:00</published><updated>2013-09-02T12:08:00-04:00</updated><author><name>brianblais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2013-09-02:/posts/2013/Sep/02/god-in-the-head/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;On the Unbelievable Facebook page, Delia Ives posted:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evidence that God exists as an idea inside peoples' heads and the
lack of evidence that he exists elsewhere is so obvious that theists
have no excuse for denying it. And, being that this idea gives them a
sense of community and their lives such meaning and purpose, one
wonders why they have any need to deny it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Hickman commented the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God as an idea explains Divine Hiddenness, Geographical distribution
of Religion, individual variety of understanding of god's
nature/character, and the evolution of theology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which I thought was very well put.  If you think of it as two
hypotheses, H1="God is real" [I know that this isn't just one
hypothesis, because of the lack of definition...just to simplify], and
H2="God is in the head", it is interesting to think of the explanatory
power and the predictive power of the two hypotheses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would add that H2 also easily explains the &lt;em&gt;types&lt;/em&gt; of miracles.  We
don't get amputees growing back limbs, but we do get things that can be
influenced by placebo and those that can get better on their own.  It
would be interesting to think of other things on each side of this
analysis.  Of course, one would probably have to have H1a, H1b, etc...
to be specific.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="wordpress_migration"></category></entry><entry><title>Presuppositions and Science</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Aug/30/presuppositions-and-science/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-08-30T10:22:00-04:00</published><updated>2013-08-30T10:22:00-04:00</updated><author><name>brianblais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2013-08-30:/posts/2013/Aug/30/presuppositions-and-science/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I heard on a podcast a theist say that he had a problem with &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;ved=0CC4QFjAA&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FVictor_J._Stenger&amp;amp;ei=vWsgUrXsCPPcsATY-4DgCw&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNG95MPQQo8A3iTYqIOUgau5LOm1PQ&amp;amp;sig2=aw2RrmUxSqP65wajuDiDGw&amp;amp;bvm=bv.51495398,d.cWc"&gt;Victor

Stenger&lt;/a&gt;.  The critique was phrased something like, that Dr Stenger
put his atheism first in his explanations, that he has a presupposition
against against using God as an explanation, a presupposition against
the supernatural.  Something struck me as odd about this perspective,
and then I realized that one never hears this sort of perspective in
scientific circles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why not?  I think it's because, in science, it is recognized that the
natural world will correct any wrong presupposition...the truth will
out.  So, if someone has a presupposition, just let it ride out and see
if it works.  Einstein had a presupposition for a static universe - he
even "corrected " his theory to get rid of the dynamics when it was
pointed out to him that that was a consequence.  Once the data came in
that was best explained with a dynamics universe, he modified the theory
and said it was a big mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example comes from my own experience teaching astronomy.  For
years I taught the prevailing wisdom that there were two possibilities
for the end of the universe.  Either the expanding universe, initiated
at the Big Bang, would have enough mass to collapse again in a Big
Crunch or it would expand forever, slowing but never stopping.  It was
never on the radar that it could be accelerating, and had anyone
suggested it, I would have said it was unreasonable.  Of course the
universe doesn't care about my bias, lack of imagination, or
presupposition and it &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;ved=0CC4QFjAA&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FAccelerating_universe&amp;amp;ei=qHEgUoeAKImvsATtn4HYBg&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNF_e7fQaSVCpDu_fd5kPvbv3rMjPg&amp;amp;sig2=ChrwqKtGXRTokLqdzr_OYQ&amp;amp;bvm=bv.51495398,d.cWc"&gt;does appear to be accelerating&lt;/a&gt; nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if someone has a presupposition against God as an explanation,
indulge them!  If they are wrong, then at some point it will make a bad
prediction and fail.  If not, then we've learned that, for the thing
explained, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Simon_Laplace#I_had_no_need_of_that_hypothesis"&gt;the concept of God is not necessary&lt;/a&gt;.  Don't complain
about the presupposition.  Know that the truth will out, eventually.  On
the other hand, I would love to know what predictions the God theory
makes (not post-dictions), so that it can be tested.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="wordpress_migration"></category></entry><entry><title>Textual Transmission Bottlenecks</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Aug/20/textual-transmission-bottlenecks/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-08-20T14:58:00-04:00</published><updated>2013-08-20T14:58:00-04:00</updated><author><name>brianblais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2013-08-20:/posts/2013/Aug/20/textual-transmission-bottlenecks/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I've been thinking about the origins of Christianity and the texts

that we have which concern it.  Then I watched Richard Carrier's new
presentation on &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbTbEvFSSF8"&gt;why he thinks Jesus didn't exist&lt;/a&gt;, and I started
thinking about this again.  The question I have, particularly for
Christians, is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What sort of effect, and what &lt;em&gt;magnitude&lt;/em&gt; of an effect, do you believe
the process of textual transmission from 0CE to 1000CE had on what we
can look at today concerning the origin of Christianity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This includes the number, quality, and contents of the ancient texts
around the time of Jesus, for example.  I think there are a number of
uncontroversial claims we can make about this question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Christian church had a near monopoly on the textual transmission
    for over 1000 years, so any and all texts went through this
    bottleneck of transmission.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Texts were written in other people's name (e.g. 1 Peter, Letter to
    Timothy, etc...), whether well-meaning or not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Texts were modified during this period, either deliberately or not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not all texts were preserved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fourth point is key, because it plays into what we have to look at
now.  First, only texts deemed important would generally be copied.  So
we would expect to have more texts of the canonical view, whatever that
happened to be.  Secondly, alternative theologies, different
perspectives, hostile and critical treatments would not make the cut.
 This isn't deliberate censorship, it is simply a product of the limited
attentional energies of scribes.  Thus, these texts would be exceedingly
rare or non-existent, thus giving a very different picture of the real
situation at the time.  Thirdly, contrary views could possibly be
deliberately destroyed, and we have evidence of that happening sometimes
as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, apologists will often make the claim that the Biblical texts that
we do have are very near the originals, or we can reconstruct a near
original from the comparison with the many copies we have.  They often
point out that we have many more copies (and earlier copies) of Biblical
texts than, say, of Plato's texts.  Fair enough.  But this is what we
would expect from the points above, and so it is not surprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have two thoughts on this.  Firstly what I always wonder is how much
of what we have is really a collection of the "winner's" texts.  If
there were (as we know to be the case) many different views of Jesus
around the time, many with conflicting perspectives, would much of them
survive the points above?  This is easily verified by the Dead Sea
Scrolls, where texts were hidden from the deliberate process of the
early church purging the conflicting theological texts.  If the Library
of Alexandria hadn't been burned, would we have the same view of
Christianity as we have now?  It's like, if the Discovery Institute were
the only publisher of science textbooks for 100 years, would we even
know science?  At least in the case of science, there is the natural
world to consult to confirm, but no such confirmation comes from
historical texts.   Of course what we don't have we can't really use in
an argument, but it does make one wonder, and should make one highly
suspect of any text that has survived the points above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, and this is the part that really gets me, is the fact that
there is not a single mention in the first century of Jesus as a person,
except for the Gospels and less than a handful of known other sources
which are either Christian forgeries (i.e. the interpolations in
Josephus) or contested texts (i.e. Tacitus).  Here, one might cry
"argument from silence fallacy", but the key difference is the process
described above.  Given what we know about the process of textual
transmission for 1000 years, we would expect any significant, outside
reference to Jesus to be enthusiastically copied and distributed, and
yet we still have such a paucity of data?  We have complaints from early
church fathers, such as Origen and Justin Martyr, concerning the lack of
early reference to Jesus in, say, Josephus so we know it mattered to
them.  So much so that someone felt that Josephus needed to be modified
to include a reference!  This point, for me, is what undermines my
confidence in the existence of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would say that for me, personally, I am agnostic on it.  I am not
convinced that he existed at all - I don't find any of the arguments
compelling - however, I wouldn't bet strongly that he &lt;em&gt;didn't&lt;/em&gt; exist.
 Still an interesting question, though.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="wordpress_migration"></category></entry><entry><title>Trying to figure out fiction I like - Game of Thrones semi-fail</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Aug/19/trying-to-figure-out-fiction-i-like-game-of-thrones-semi-fail/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-08-19T00:20:00-04:00</published><updated>2013-08-19T00:20:00-04:00</updated><author><name>brianblais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2013-08-19:/posts/2013/Aug/19/trying-to-figure-out-fiction-i-like-game-of-thrones-semi-fail/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I just read the first book of the Fire and Ice series (Game of

Thrones), and am not going to read any more. In fact, I pulled a "24" on
it. This is a reference to what I did with the series "24" - a series I
liked, in many ways. At the time of watching "24", I got stressed out
with the kid-kidnapping scenes (as a parent, this sort of thing bothers
me way more than when I wasn't), and the entire scenario was just too
stressful! I felt I couldn't continue, but I also couldn't &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;
continue because I needed closure.  So, I decided to watch the last
episode of that season, ruining all of the surprises, and then I had
closure and could put it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Game of Thrones, I liked the narrative, but the world wasn't
compelling to me.  I thought there was too much going on at once, so
there seemed like too little direction.  I don't really care about this
king overthrowing that king, etc...  I like a personal story, or
message.  I want the story to be going somewhere, and after 600+ pages
it just wasn't.  I could imagine the story in Game of Thrones just going
on and on, and not caring much for the outcome (especially when the only
people you care about in the story seem to have a short shelf life).
 So, realizing this, I didn't want to put the effort in to read through
all of the rest of the novels, but I also wanted closure.  So, I decided
to read all the plot summaries for the other four books - summaries
which actually supported my initial assessment of the story not really
going anywhere in particular, but a lot of stuff happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am trying to think of what I like, and why.  So I liked Lord of the
Rings, which if you recall you get the big story arc within the first
couple chapters, and then add to it as you go along.  However, the
characters are always trying to accomplish something.  Win or lose, at
least it is clear what the outcomes could be.  Babylon 5, the big story
arc is introduced mid-season 1, and then added to from the end of season
1 to the peak in the middle-to-late season 3.  There were a number of
compelling mini-arcs here, and mysteries, which allowed you to get into
the characters in the beginning, and also to tie the seasons together.
 Battlestar Gallactica only had mini-arcs, and no big arc.  Within each
mini-arc it was very good.  Overall, it fell a bit flat because there
wasn't anything tying it together.  Harry Potter was excellent, much of
which due to an interesting world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, Game of Thrones didn't fit the type of fiction I like, even though
the narrative itself was quite interesting and well written.  What would

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“what sort of evidence would convince you of, let’s say, the
resurrection of Jesus?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to break this up into two separate questions, because it will put
into context my perspectives on historical evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="whatwouldittakeformetobelievethattherewasamodernresurrection"&gt;What would it take for me to believe that there was a &lt;em&gt;modern&lt;/em&gt; resurrection?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a case of a &lt;a href="http://www.heavensfamily.org/ss/resurrection-from-the-dead-pastor-daniel-ekechukwu"&gt;Nigerian Pastor&lt;/a&gt; resurrected in 2001 after being
dead for 3 days following a severe car accident. Sounds about as good as
it gets, as far as evidence. Certainly way more evidence than we have
for Jesus - many more “witnesses”, documentation of medical examination,
many more recent accounts, etc… There are some skeptical accounts
&lt;a href="http://www.helium.com/items/506673-the-truth-about-the-resurrection-of-daniel-ekechukwu"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and also &lt;a href="http://www.deceptioninthechurch.com/bonnke2.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. This is the first I’ve heard of it. Am I
convinced? Nope. Why not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the fact that there is a definite possibility of motive for fraud
    and/or exaggeration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the fact that the events occur in a culture riddled with
    superstitious thinking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the fact that the events take place in a region without the proper
    diagnostic technology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the story contains elements such as a transfer to a smaller, lesser
    equipped hospital where the patient knew the doctors when - given
    the supposed severity of the accident- the nearby, bigger hospital
    would be the logical choice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these raises the level of suspicion. What I am criticizing here
is that the claims are being made and investigated by possibly credulous
individuals, who have something to gain, and do not make the proper
steps to rule out fraud, exaggeration, mistakes, etc… When I look at an
extraordinary claim, I want these. To convince me it would take&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a group of unrelated individuals backing up the claims…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;…applying strict skeptical methods, …&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;…with nothing or little to gain, …&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;…and a history of honesty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would want to see confirmation from people who have something to
&lt;em&gt;lose&lt;/em&gt; in agreeing to it, either a significant departure from their
professed beliefs, or something similar. Pretty much I’m asking for
something similar to the &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/1m-challenge.html"&gt;JREF prize&lt;/a&gt;, although it need not be that
particular organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; skeptical? I don’t think so. I hold this same level of
skepticism for scientific claims, two examples I outline in &lt;a href="http://brianblais.wordpress.com/2012/09/25/naturalistic-bias-presupposing-naturalism/"&gt;a previous
post&lt;/a&gt;. To shamelessly quote myself,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If the evidence is not enough to convince a reasonable skeptic, then
we can’t be particularly confident in it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is especially the case with extraordinary claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="whatwouldittakeformetobelievethattherewasanancientresurrection"&gt;What would it take for me to believe that there was an &lt;em&gt;ancient&lt;/em&gt; resurrection?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given this, could I ever be made to believe in an ancient resurrection?
Probably not. Not because I am closed to it, but the kinds of methods
and evidence that I would need to convince me of a modern resurrection
just didn’t exist 2000 years ago. Four accounts (five if you count
Paul), that demonstrate mutual copying, and don’t even claim to be
eyewitnesses is hardly convincing for even more meagre claims than
miraculous resurrections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christians, do you believe every miracle claim? If not, what criteria do
you use? If the same amount of evidence for Jesus’ resurrection existed
today (i.e. a handful of 2nd and 3rd hand reports, no physical evidence,
and no skeptical inquiry), would you be convinced? I would wager that
not a single honest Christian would accept this, or else they’d have to
accept a million other miracle claims from other faiths, and be so
credulous as to not be functional.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="wordpress_migration"></category><category term="Religion"></category><category term="Science"></category><category term="Uncategorized"></category></entry><entry><title>A question for theists: why do you not believe UFOs are alien spacecraft?</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Jul/13/a-question-for-theists-why-do-you-not-believe-ufos-are-alien-spacecraft/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-07-13T01:12:00-04:00</published><updated>2013-07-13T01:12:00-04:00</updated><author><name>brianblais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2013-07-13:/posts/2013/Jul/13/a-question-for-theists-why-do-you-not-believe-ufos-are-alien-spacecraft/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Now, I am really not trying to be snarky here, so please hear me out.

 Try to honestly ask yourself the question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what evidence would make you reasonably sure that a UFO claim is in
fact an alien spacecraft?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would it take 1 photo or 100?  Would it take 4 testimonials from
eyewitnesses, or 50?  Would it depend who reports it, like the New York
Times or NASA?  Would you need someone to stake their reputation on it,
or their life?  Would you require physical evidence, or would a report
suffice?  What would it take?  If you really wrap your head around this
question, and come up with a possible list of evidence that would
possibly sway your opinion, as well as the reasons why that evidence
would be convincing, you'll start to understand what an atheist thinks
of the resurrection of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the day is done, the only evidence for the resurrection comes from
(at best) four (so-called) eyewitness testimonials written decades after
the events and the possible (although extremely dubious) reports of a
handful of people believing so strongly they they laid their life down
for it.  There is no physical evidence, and no more than  a handful of
extra-biblical references (again, with dubious or weak content).  From
all of the arguments I've heard, this seems convincing to Christians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to UFO reports, for every eye-witness claimed for the
resurrection, I can produce 100 witnesses for alien spacecraft - with
direct reports within hours of the events.  For every supposed apostle
who is claimed to have been martyred, I can produce several people
giving their lives for the belief in alien spacecraft (think, Heaven's
Gate here).  For every extra-biblical reference, I can give you
thousands of photos, metal implants and alien abduction therapy session
reports - all of which is stronger evidence than any of the
extra-biblical references to Jesus (some of which are forged).  Yet,
despite all of this, I am not at all convinced that UFOs are alien
spacecraft, and neither are most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is it then, that people are convinced by the --far less-- evidence
for the resurrection?  What's the difference?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="wordpress_migration"></category></entry><entry><title>Baseball and the Naming of the Gospels</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Jul/07/baseball-and-the-naming-of-the-gospels/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-07-07T18:48:00-04:00</published><updated>2013-07-07T18:48:00-04:00</updated><author><name>brianblais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2013-07-07:/posts/2013/Jul/07/baseball-and-the-naming-of-the-gospels/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I was listening to the &lt;a href="http://freethoughtblogs.com/reasonabledoubts"&gt;Reasonable Doubts podcast&lt;/a&gt;, and in either

Christianity&lt;/a&gt; (both debates), the theist in the debate said something
to the effect that, had the Gospels been forged (i.e. weren't written by
the claimed disciple Matthew, translator Mark, historian Luke, and
disciple John) then the forgers would have chosen more notable author
names, such as Peter or James, to enhance the reputation of the text.
 He then made an analogy with baseball card forgeries, and said that if
you were to make a forgery of baseball cards you'd choose someone like
Babe Ruth, and not some lesser player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love analogies with the rebuttal built in!  If you were forging
baseball cards, you most certainly &lt;em&gt;wouldn't&lt;/em&gt; do one of Babe Ruth,
because the BS meter would peg on anyone who you showed it to.  You
would want to choose one that was valuable but not &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; valuable.
 Otherwise, it might be rejected outright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would follow that there is some advantage to choosing a name that has
some prestige (e.g. Matthew) but not &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; much (e.g. Peter).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to mention that the names on the documents were added many
decades after they were written, the order of the Gospels was determined
with the mistaken idea that Matthew was primary, and that the so-called
eye-witness (Matthew) copies verbatim the text of a non eye-witness
(Mark).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="wordpress_migration"></category></entry><entry><title>Rules for Criticizing Opponents</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Jun/14/rules-for-criticizing-opponents/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-06-14T13:40:00-04:00</published><updated>2013-06-14T13:40:00-04:00</updated><author><name>brianblais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2013-06-14:/posts/2013/Jun/14/rules-for-criticizing-opponents/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Below is an excerpt from &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2013/may/19/daniel-dennett-intuition-pumps-thinking-extract"&gt;Dan Dennett's article&lt;/a&gt; article "tools for

too much of the interview time was spent talking about free will and

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just how charitable are you supposed to be when criticising the views
of an opponent? If there are obvious contradictions in the opponent's
case, then you should point them out, forcefully. If there are
somewhat hidden contradictions, you should carefully expose them to
view – and then dump on them. But the search for hidden contradictions
often crosses the line into nitpicking, sea-lawyering and outright
parody. The thrill of the chase and the conviction that your opponent
has to be harbouring a confusion somewhere encourages uncharitable
interpretation, which gives you an easy target to attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But such easy targets are typically irrelevant to the real issues at
stake and simply waste everybody's time and patience, even if they
give amusement to your supporters. The best antidote I know for this
tendency to caricature one's opponent is a list of rules promulgated
many years ago by social psychologist and game theorist Anatol
Rapoport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to compose a successful critical commentary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. &lt;/strong&gt;Attempt to re-express your target's position so clearly,
vividly and fairly that your target says: "Thanks, I wish I'd thought
of putting it that way."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. &lt;/strong&gt;List any points of agreement (especially if they are not
matters of general or widespread agreement).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. &lt;/strong&gt;Mention anything you have learned from your target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. &lt;/strong&gt;Only then are you permitted to say so much as a word of
rebuttal or criticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One immediate effect of following these rules is that your targets
will be a receptive audience for your criticism: you have already
shown that you understand their positions as well as they do, and have
demonstrated good judgment (you agree with them on some important
matters and have even been persuaded by something they said).
Following Rapoport's rules is always, for me, something of a struggle…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like these rules, in theory, and perhaps I should try practicing them
more strictly to see if they are valuable in practice.  I think the
context might matter.  In a debate, with limited time, it might not
work.  It may also not work well if you suspect that your opponent is
going to quote-mine the heck out of your response.  However, it may be a
good attitude to develop, and keep one from falling into closed-minded
arrogance.  Even if one doesn't &lt;em&gt;communicate&lt;/em&gt; this directly, forcing
yourself to itemize points of agreement is probably a good thing, and it
is always a good idea to be able to communicate ones opponents position
with fidelity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick survey of responses of people who don't like Dan Dennett claim
that he isn't putting these words to good use himself, although I think
he probably comes closer than the other "horsemen" (i.e. Dawkins,
Harris, Hitchens).&lt;/p&gt;

ongoing conversation about the origins of morality, modern perspectives
on slavery, and the roles of Christianity in it all. In this latest
reply he brings in a large amount of global history that I simply cannot
comment on.  I am not nearly as well read in those issues. However, this
provides an opportunity to address another problem that comes up in many
of these conversations: how do you deal with claims that you can’t track
down yourself? Perhaps there is not enough time to track them down, or
it is too technical for you to understand, or some other reason. I’ll
deal with that issue at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I want to comment on this from Marshall:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian argues at a lower decibel level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks! I’m not sure if everyone agrees that I operate at low decibel,
but I do try to be civil (most of the time!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sam Harris thinks it is obvious that owning slaves is wrong. Brian
Blais thinks it obvious that gay marriage is OK. I think it is obvious
that both beliefs are formed in a particular culture due to that
culture’s heritage, pulled in certain directions by particular lines
of thinking, and would not likely take the same form in, say, Aztec or
Wahhabi societies so readily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, I draw a distinction between the &lt;em&gt;cultural&lt;/em&gt; bias that each of us
have and the more objective perspectives we can obtain through rational
discourse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two moral issues, here: (1) Why should we care about
“increasing suffering” that is not our own suffering, or (a
Confucianist may ask) of that of people we are intimately related to?
(2) Why should we assume that in fact, these particular “evils” really
do cause more suffering? (More than, say, pornography? Or growing up
with Dad? Or abortion? Or intellectual arrogance?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you read Sam Harris’ book, or see some of his lectures on this
    issue, he deals with it far more eloquently than I. In a practical
    way, we care about the suffering of others because it is directly
    tied to the suffering of us. Further, we must care about the
    suffering of conscious creatures because this is the moral thing to
    do. I don’t want to repeat all of Harris’ theses here, however.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why should we “assume” these particular “evils” do cause more
    suffering? Actually, we do not simply assume it. We marshal (no pun
    intended, David) the evidence for it. This is what separates a
    rational basis for morality and a religious one - there are no
    dictates from “on high”. I could be wrong about it, but from what
    evidence I can see, depriving the rights of a minority that most
    enjoy causes needless suffering. This applies to slavery and it
    applies to the rights of consenting adults to marry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does Blais know his own set of values is superior to all those
others&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess I don’t, except in cases where someone is making a moral claim
and cannot justify on the basis of decreased suffering. It’s like
scientific knowledge that way - how do I know that my knowledge is
better than another? I don’t, until they make specific claims and I see
their justification. I could be wrong about it. I could be corrected,
and convinced of a perspective I don’t currently hold. I don’t see a
problem with this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, one might argue, from a utilitarian point of view, that the
Athenians increased total happiness by enslaving half their
population, so that free men could sculpt, debate, write philosophy,
and invent science. Might there not be a larger total sum of happiness
in such a Republic, than among a people that is all free, but fails at
such achievements? Or would the Athenians have increased the world’s
total future happiness without those slaves?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is indeed possible. No one ever said that the moral calculus would
be easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marshall continues…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Gospel does say, very clearly, that we are to care even for
our enemies, return good for evil, and love our neighbors as
ourselves. There’s nothing “vague” about that: it’s repeated hundreds
of times, in different ways, and as eloquently as anything ever
written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not think that I came to bring peace on Earth; I did not come to
bring peace, but a sword. For I came to set a man against his father,
and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her
mother-in-law; and a man’s enemies will be the members of his
household.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over
them–bring them here and kill them in front of me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recurring problem is that there &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; good things there, but
also &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; things there. Given the history of Christianity, and the
current divisions between different groups of Christians, I am not
simply picking things out of context.  Intelligent, well-meaning people
draw opposite messages from the Bible.  If this were, say, the works of
Shakespeare I’d have no problem with it. We’d simply take the lessons we
like, and call the rest of it anachronistic. This is what moderate
Christians do with much of Bible. Even conservative Christians do it
with at least the brutal dictates in the Old Testament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the New Atheists are waging verbal civil war on one another,
based on different ethical positions they take in regard to feminism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atheism is simply the label we give to people who are not convinced by
the arguments of theists on the narrow question about the existence of
God. After that, there needn’t be any agreement. That atheists disagree
on feminism is perfectly fine. If they disagreed on the existence of
God, then there would be a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I don’t think educated Christians are so starkly divided, compared
to the various schools of atheism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really? You think that, say, educated Baptists and Catholics really
agree on core interpretations of the divinity of Jesus? What about with
Universalists? These are divisions about &lt;em&gt;core&lt;/em&gt; beliefs, not tangential
topics like feminism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="dealing-with-claims-beyond-ones-ability-to-check"&gt;Dealing with claims beyond ones ability to check&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Marshall’s post, he says&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My impression is that it is also rather hard to find early reform
movements within Hindu culture that challenged caste. Mohandas Gandhi
came at the tail end of reform inspired by outside forces (Christian
missions), as John Farquhar shows in Modern Religious Movements in
India. In China, while some ethnic groups refrained from binding the
feet of women, like the Hakka, it took an outside agent – Christian
missions, again – to challenge it inside the Han Chinese culture as a
whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t have the expertise in history to really comment, nor can I make
an authoritative judgement on it. However, I am skeptical of it
nonetheless. Why? If someone makes a claim about the rise of Napoleon,
beyond my ability to confirm, I will tend to believe them - unless I
suspect that this claim supports some other strongly held belief of the
person. In that case, I would be skeptical of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of this description from Marshall, it sounds too much like
the claim that started this discussion, that somehow Christianity was
the source of “separation of church and state”. A claim that I believe
is biased in the direction of Marshall’s personal beliefs in the tenets
of Christianity. It seems, although I can’t demonstrate it conclusively
without a lot more work, to be of a similar flavor.  I ran into the same
problem with UFO sightings.  I can't investigate every single UFO claim,
but every one that I did have time to track down turned out to be
mundane.  The same with faith-healings.  This one deals with the force
of history, and I simply don't have the time to corroborate the facts,
but I am still left unconvinced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps that puts this conversation at an end, with all of the issues
pretty much on the table for others to read and react to. It has
certainly been an interesting and challenging exchange.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="wordpress_migration"></category></entry><entry><title>Christianity and morality</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Jun/10/christianity-and-morality/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-06-10T12:50:00-04:00</published><updated>2013-06-10T12:50:00-04:00</updated><author><name>brianblais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2013-06-10:/posts/2013/Jun/10/christianity-and-morality/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In a comment to &lt;a href="http://brianblais.wordpress.com/2013/06/07/miscellaneous-christian-topics-another-counter-to-marshall/"&gt;one of my posts&lt;/a&gt; about miscellaneous Christian ideas,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do you suppose that you think slavery is wrong?  How do …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In a comment to &lt;a href="http://brianblais.wordpress.com/2013/06/07/miscellaneous-christian-topics-another-counter-to-marshall/"&gt;one of my posts&lt;/a&gt; about miscellaneous Christian ideas,
David Marshall &lt;a href="http://brianblais.wordpress.com/2013/06/07/miscellaneous-christian-topics-another-counter-to-marshall/#comment-446"&gt;asks the following question&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do you suppose that you think slavery is wrong?  How do you know
it isn't because you are at the end of a long process of
Christianization of morals within western thought, that I (briefly)
describe?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is a fair question, and felt it needed some thought, so I
took a few days to ponder it.  I'm sure there is more to be said on
this, but let me outline my thinking process on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where did I come by the concept of why slavery is wrong?  I'd say it
starts with the way I was brought up, where I learned to treat people
well.  From there, learning history, I could see that history is filled
with examples of people treating others badly (including owning other
people as property) and people treating others well.    Of course, this
part is cultural, and if I had been raised in the South in the 1830's,
slavery would not immediately seem obviously wrong.  As an adult, one
learns about the proper justification for beliefs.  How beliefs should
be based on evidence, and learning the methods of science, I was able to
much better evaluate the reasons behind claims, and also understand the
ways in which erroneous justifications have been made for many claims.
 This ties into psychology, economics, and a whole host of other human
activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all this, I've come to accept that morality relates to the
suffering and well-being of conscious creatures.  As such, we can make
objective evaluations about how to increase well-being and decrease
suffering.  It becomes clear, then, that owning people as property
needlessly increases suffering, and as such is objectively wrong.  I can
then apply this principle in cases where I was raised with a different
moral perspective, and find that some of these are wrong.  For example,
banning gay marriage is wrong (sorry for the double negative!), even if
I was raised with the opposite.  It needlessly adds to human suffering.
 So, I can override my cultural teachings on morality, and in the same
way I am able to judge other worldviews for obvious cases of immoral
behavior (e.g. suicide bombing, genocide, etc...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do I know it isn't because I am at the end of a long process of
Christianization of morals within western thought?  I prefer to
rephrase, slightly, saying "why do I believe it is likely..." instead of
"how do I know...".  This is a matter of probability, and I don't think
it is possible to demonstrate the truth of a claim like this to the
level of probability that I would consider knowledge.  So why do I
believe "slavery is wrong" is &lt;em&gt;unlikely&lt;/em&gt; to be simply the end of a
process of Christianization?  First and foremost, I see no clear
evidence that Christianity as revealed in the Bible has a clear message
against slavery.  You can find passages vaguely against particular
slave-master situations, and you can find dictates about how you should
treat your slaves.  There is &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; a case where it says,
&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;clearly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, that slavery
is in fact wrong.  Second, there is historical precedent for Christians
to argue for slavery based on a Biblical reading - and this wasn't just
a fringe reading.  One might argue that they are using a wrong reading,
but how do we know?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, following on this, my experience with &lt;em&gt;legitimate&lt;/em&gt; searches for
truth is that they converge after some initial state of disagreement.
 Take any previously contentious argument in science that is currently
well understood - say, the origin of heat.  Over the past couple hundred
years there were many theories about what heat was - the elemental
theory of heat, a fluid theory, a statistical theory, etc...  Once the
scientific methodology was improved to the point where this problem
could be explored rationally, the ideas started to converge.  There were
fewer interpretations of the evidence considered valid, and now there
really is just one.  This is true for &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; branch of science, and I
would contend, any approach that addresses the truth - you start off
with divergent ideas when you don't fully understand a topic, and
converge to a single understanding.  I see&lt;em&gt;no evidence&lt;/em&gt; of this in
Christianity.  There is &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; disagreement now than 1000 years ago
about pivotal doctrines.  This is not the pattern we see for something
that is &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt;, but is a pattern for something we see a &lt;em&gt;cultural&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I do see evidence of Christians changing their doctrines to
suit their particular ends.  Most of the Old Testament is conveniently
ignored, interpreted away, because it has become untenable in a modern
society.  Christian's don't do this because it is a natural, obvious
step in the faith but because modern, secular progress has demonstrated
that many of the doctrines are either wrong or simply useless.  The
authority of religion has been battered from all directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, I see evidence of cherry-picking, an inconsistent message in the
Bible which allows for nearly any philosophical stance to justified with
the proper cherry-picking, and a lot of post-hoc argumentation.  I see
immoral acts not only allowed by God, but commanded by God, and thus at
best an inconsistent moral picture from the "good" book.  I've heard it
referred to as the "great book of multiple choice", and I believe that
this interpretation is more consistent with all of the aspects I've seen
about Christianity, both present and historical.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="wordpress_migration"></category><category term="Religion"></category><category term="Uncategorized"></category></entry><entry><title>Miscellaneous Christian topics - another counter to Marshall</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Jun/07/miscellaneous-christian-topics-another-counter-to-marshall/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-06-07T12:33:00-04:00</published><updated>2013-06-07T12:33:00-04:00</updated><author><name>brianblais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2013-06-07:/posts/2013/Jun/07/miscellaneous-christian-topics-another-counter-to-marshall/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.5;"&gt;Over at David Marshall's blog he has

posts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.5;"&gt; (sidenote: I do promise to get
back to that project...I have a number of episodes in the hopper, I just
need a block of time to type).  At any rate, let me counter again, and
see where this goes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the topic of "militant atheism", I pointed out a double standard in
the use of the word "militant" to atheists and islamists.  Marshall
replies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What causes us to call them "militant," rather, is the refusal to
admit the vast amount of good that the Judeo-Christian tradition has
accomplished&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this makes my point.  Do we call Militant Islamists "militant"
because they refuse to see the good in other people?  No, it's because
they blow stuff up.   You might call the New Atheists "agressive",
"obnoxious", "misguided" or "wrong", but "militant" they are not.
 Marshall continues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have more people been killed by angry Christian terrorists per
Christian in recent years, or by angry atheist terrorists?  Timothy
McVeigh was an agnostic, that would count when atheists take census
for the purpose of expanding their ranks.  The Unabomber appears to
have been an atheist. The Tamil Tigers, who do more of this sort of
thing than almost anyone, may be as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I could counter with things like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_violence"&gt;anti-abortion violence&lt;/a&gt;, and
that Timothy McVeigh's religious views were &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_McVeigh#Political_views_and_religious_beliefs"&gt;mixed at best&lt;/a&gt;, etc...
However I  think that, even if we grant that McVeigh was an atheist and
the Unabomber too, that they didn't do the horrible things &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;in the
name&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; of their atheism.  However, the anti-abortion violence, and the
historical violence of Christians, has been done &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;in the name&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; of
the religion.  That's a big difference, and one that seems to be
conveniently ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, to compare the New Atheists (say, any of the four of Dawkins,
Harris, Hitchens, and Dennett) to any of these people, or to Stalinist
Russia, or Hitler, or any of them is totally ridiculous.  No matter how
strident they are, the New Atheists are not "militant" in the same way
that militant Islamists are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the point about "separation of church and state", which Marshall has
stated was a Christian idea, and that I had countered with: "If the
separation was truly was a Christian idea, then I’d expect a totally
different European history from 0 AD to 1700 AD! ", he counters with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Blais is again not being reasonable about that history, either. 
First of all, Christians didn't attain much power until almost 400
AD.  And secondly, the world in which Christians then attained power
had fixed political structures, which transformed Christianity about
as much as Christianity changed it.  It is anachronistic to judge the
5th Century by what humanity has attained since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what you're saying, is that the Christians were victims of the
political structure such that the fundamental Christian belief of
"separation of church and state" was not able to be implemented for the
1300 year Christian rule?  Sorry, but that seems like a dodge to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus also said, "Forgive your enemies."  The claim that this, too, is
a Christian idea, is not rendered "ridiculous" by the fact that
Christians have often actually killed and cursed, not forgiven, their
enemies.  An idea can be a Christian idea, even can come from Jesus'
mouth, without therefore determining all subsequent Christian history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure.  However, since there is no statement "separation of church and
state" anywhere in the NT, it seems like quite a stretch to make the
same claim.  One can probably find a decent number of examples of people
throughout the last 2000 years putting "forgive your enemies" to good
use, or at least claiming it is a Christian idea.  Can you find any
examples prior to the enlightenment of any Christian espousing the
separation of church and state, except in the most limited cases (e.g.
you pay taxes to government not to the church).  Clearly &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
European monarchy was founded on the establishment of a direct
connection between church and state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marshall didn't seem to like my response concerning the topic of
slavery.  I said: " It is faint praise indeed that the best you can say
about the Christian stance on slavery, historically, is that some slaves
were freed so that 700 years later (!!!) some small areas in the world,
that didn’t feel that they needed slaves anymore, didn’t have slaves. "&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His response?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faint praise?  Tens of millions of slaves have been freed, due to the
abolitionist movements that began with praying Christians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, I am definitely against slavery, and I definitely think it
is a great thing that tens of millions of slaves have been freed.  That
wasn't the point.  The point was that Marshall said in the Unbelievable
episode:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginning in the fourth century slaves were set free so that by the
eleventh century there were areas of western Europe free of slaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, put another way, Christian doctrine was so anti-slavery that, when
the Christians had the most power, the best they could do was to take
700 years to rid some areas of Europe of slaves...areas that just didn't
need slaves anyway.  I don't think that's an impressive record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sixty percent of anti-slave organizers were Christian pastors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where does this come from?  I'd like a citation for this.  Regardless,
it doesn't surprise me.  I would also guess that most of the &lt;em&gt;pro&lt;/em&gt;-slave
organizers (like George Whitefield) were also Christian pastors.  Why?
 Because, at that time (and still now, in the US) most of the people
were Christians, and further, pastors were social and political
organizers.  So as a matter of probability, this claim would seem to be
likely, and thus carries no weight in the argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marshall continues&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is clear the New Testament condemns the slave trade, though.  It is
clear Paul told Philemon he should accept Onesimus back "no longer as
a slave, but as a dear brother."  And it ought be clear that "loving
your neighbor as yourself" is pretty hard to do if you put chains
around your neighbor's neck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Paul also says this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Slaves, obey your earthly masters with respect and fear, and with
sincerity of heart, just as you would obey Christ. 6 Obey them not
only to win their favor when their eye is on you, but as slaves of
Christ, doing the will of God from your heart. 7 Serve wholeheartedly,
as if you were serving the Lord, not people, 8 because you know that
the Lord will reward each one for whatever good they do, whether they
are slave or free ."(&lt;a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians%206:5-6:8&amp;amp;version=NIV"&gt;Ephesians 6:5-8&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul is not being particularly anti-slavery here.  This is part of the
problem - the message in the Bible is not clear, despite Marshall's
claims to the contrary.  Like fables and proverbs, you can find opposite
messages, enough to justify whatever you'd like (e.g. too many cooks
spoil the broth; many hands make light work).  As a result, you get
perspectives like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Slavery] was established by decree of Almighty God...it is sanctioned
in the Bible, in both Testaments, from Genesis to Revelation...it has
existed in all ages, has been found among the people of the highest
civilization, and in nations of the highest proficiency in the arts -
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_views_on_slavery#Opposition_to_abolitionism"&gt;Jefferson Davis, President, Confederate States of America&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is he reading the same Bible?  Is he simply dense and uninformed?  Is
the Bible so unclear that people can have such a diverse set of opinions
on it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, on the slavery issue, we have Marshall saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it is unrealistic and unreasonable to expect the Bible to
institute a crusade against slavery from the get-go.  Slavery was not,
in fact, an unambiguous evil in the ancient world: the alternative (as
in Herodotus, and even in Homer) was often to just kill enemy soldiers
(or even civilians) whom you captured.  What the Bible did, was slowly
create a society, and a set of moral ideals, that made slavery less
and less important, and liberation of slaves more and more admirable,
even while glorifying labor, and enriching ordinary workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, let me get this straight.  Marshall seems to be saying that the same
God that created the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;universe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, inspired the writing of the Bible,
created our moral sense, and had a &lt;em&gt;direct and personal&lt;/em&gt; hand in human
affairs from, say, 4000 BC to 50AD (at least!) couldn't come up with a
way to solve the slavery problem?  Really?  The best God could do was to
drop in some conflicting perspectives on the issue into a book so that
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;1500 years&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; after that we could finally get rid of slaves?  Is it
truly unreasonable to expect a clear condemnation of slavery in a book
purporting to deliver the message of absolute morality from an
all-knowing source?  This is a remarkable claim!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On to ID.  One point of clarification I want to make is the following.
 Marshall tires of the lying label that I used:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for "lying," the charge grows tedious.  New Atheists are so eager
with this charge -- even against C. S. Lewis, recently, and often
against me -- one just wishes they would choose to argue like adults,
frankly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I was not quoting New Atheists here, I was referring to what
the conservative, Bush appointed Judge Jones said &lt;a href="http://ncse.com/files/pub/legal/kitzmiller/highlights/2005-12-20_Kitzmiller_decision.pdf"&gt;in his decision&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is ironic that several of these individuals, who so staunchly and
proudly touted their religious convictions in public, would time and
again lie to cover their tracks and disguise the real purpose behind
the ID Policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also read a fair amount about ID, read many of the sources (Behe,
Dembski, others), read all of the Dover documents, followed Ken Miller's
seminars, etc...  I do not arrive at my opinions about ID entirely
uninformed.  ID is religion masquerading as science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Marshall on corporal punishment and child abuse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though I'm a little curious about calling corporal punishment -- what,
spanking a bratty child on the behind? -- "child abuse."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The classics work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was thinking of more extreme examples of corporal punishment than
"spanking on the behind".  Either way, however, no matter your attitude
toward spanking, the act of simply calling a child "Christian" is even
less worthy of being labeled "abuse".  I find Dawkins' language in this
example so over the top that it ceases to be useful.&lt;/p&gt;

Next Generation and Deep Space Nine with interest. I did skip Voyager
and Enterprise, but definitely follow the recent reboot movies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I still enjoy the storytelling of Star Trek, I do have a
problem with it that creeps into other shows as well. I noticed it again
in the most recent movie. Because Star Trek is a franchise, almost by
definition, none of the characters can actually die or change in any
substantive way. Because of this, from a storytelling perspective,
dramatic scenes are a lot less dramatic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to see this also is to imagine spinning out possibly story
lines, given only the pilot episode. If you did this for, say, Star Trek
the Next Generation you would probably hit a few of episodes even as
late as season 7. If, however, you tried to do it with Babylon 5 you
wouldn't even make it to late season 2. Perhaps this is the story
telling equivalent of market failures with monopolies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed the new Star Trek movie (especially in 3D!), but I sometimes
wish that this lingering constraint on the show were lifted. Imagine,
for example, a series set in the Star Trek universe where the characters
actually change? Where there isn't a technological solution to every
problem? Where the outcome wasn't really known in advance?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="wordpress_migration"></category></entry><entry><title>A little about miracles</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/May/21/a-little-about-miracles/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-05-21T18:35:00-04:00</published><updated>2013-05-21T18:35:00-04:00</updated><author><name>brianblais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2013-05-21:/posts/2013/May/21/a-little-about-miracles/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I listened to a &lt;a href="http://donjohnsonministries.org/discussion-with-naturalist-matthew-ferguson-part-1/"&gt;recent interview&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://donjohnsonministries.org/discussion-with-naturalist-matthew-ferguson-part-2/)"&gt;Part 2&lt;/a&gt;) with Matthew Ferguson

Ferguson has a &lt;a href="http://adversusapologetica.wordpress.com/"&gt;very interesting blog&lt;/a&gt; that I just found, and have
been enjoying reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pandoc-initial-comments"&gt;Initial Comments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I did find several points in the informal debate that I thought
could be handled better (from my armchair, of course!). Just to note
that although I think that if I were there, I might have been able to
deal with some of the questions better, I also think that nearly all of
the debate was handled much better than I could have done. What struck
me at one point, in &lt;a href="http://donjohnsonministries.org/discussion-with-naturalist-matthew-ferguson-part-2/)"&gt;Part 2&lt;/a&gt;, was Don's zeal for the &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Miracles-Credibility-New-Testament-Accounts/dp/0801039525"&gt;miracles
collection by Craig Keener&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.uncrediblehallq.net/2012/01/0shou5/review-of-craig-keeners-miracles/)"&gt;review of Keener's book here&lt;/a&gt;). He
seemed to think that because there were hundreds of thousands of miracle
reports, that that was evidence for their truth. He was, however, quick
to dismiss any comparison with other pseudosciences. Ferguson admits on
his blog that the "debate came off as a little ambushy" on this point,
because he hadn't read this book, and clearly couldn't respond to all of
them, but I think that misses the point. I think one can address the
miracle claims without being entirely dismissive (and sounding closed
minded) but putting them in their proper context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pandoc-evaluating-miracle-claims---some-lessons-from-ufos"&gt;Evaluating Miracle Claims - Some Lessons from UFOs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in Keener's book, there is a &lt;strong&gt;huge&lt;/strong&gt; collection of claims of
miracles. We could find an equally large collection of UFO sightings.
Now, Don and other Christians would be quick to dismiss UFO sightings as
irrelevant, but I would raise the questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Given a set of claims, how do we determine whether they are true?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are any of them true?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do the number of claims contribute to their truth value?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that the methods we use to determine the veracity of UFO
claims can be used to investigate any claims, remarkable or not,
including miracle claims. To start, we clearly we can't personally
investigate every single claim, and thus cannot comment on ones we
haven't investigated except to note where it seems similar to ones that
we have. I have a friend who I managed (over several years) to break of
his UFO enthusiasm - he was convinced by all of these television shows
claiming evidence for alien spacecraft observations and visitations. He
invited me over to his house periodically to watch these shows to get my
reaction. This is the process that I would use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I would write down each specific claim - what was &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; being
    claimed, and what details were there? (names of places, time, who
    saw what, etc...)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I would note any initial inconsistencies (for example, there was
    once where, in the interview process, the different witnesses
    actually described &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; things! this seemed to go unnoticed
    by the reporter)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I would go home, and try to find out as much about the &lt;em&gt;original&lt;/em&gt;
    details of the events. It would take me probably at least an hour
    for each case, and some I couldn't track down. However, many of them
    I could. I would read the claims again, and the skeptical accounts,
    and the responses to the skeptics. I would try to see what the
    actual data was, how it was collected, when it was reported, etc...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I found for &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; case that I personally investigated was the
following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of the &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt;, original claims were mundane. Lights in the
    sky, marks on the ground, etc.... No hard evidence of anything
    remarkable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Misinterpretation of a known object, or objects, in the sky or on
    the ground.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The reporting of the claims grew more and more remarkable. A
    particularly good example was the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendlesham_Forest_incident"&gt;Rendelsham Forest&lt;/a&gt; UFO case
    where the initial reports were just lights, and the later reports
    involved spacecraft, alien code-books, etc...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There were serious inconsistencies between reports, or anomalous
    non-reports (i.e. people who &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; have seen something but
    didn't). A good example of this was a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_O'Hare_International_Airport_UFO_sighting"&gt;Chicago airport sighting&lt;/a&gt;
    where a small group of people, in a localized area of the airport,
    saw something yet the large number of other people in the nearby
    areas of the airport reported nothing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I repeat - in &lt;em&gt;every single case&lt;/em&gt; that I personally investigated, these
points were in evidence. Then I look through something like the &lt;a href="http://files.ncas.org/condon/text/contents.htm"&gt;Condon
report&lt;/a&gt; where they go through something like 30 years of data in the
height of the UFO craze and don't come up with even a single item that
is not mundane in its nature. After that, new UFO claims I see with
suspicion even if I don't check them out. If something seems
straightforward to check out, I might do it, but I don't feel it is my
job to investigate every claim. If there had been even a single case
which pointed to something probably remarkable, I'd have a different
attitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson: if the claims made shrink and disappear at critical and
skeptical investigation, the claim is not likely to be true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pandoc-miracles"&gt;Miracles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Catholic Church has a division to investigate miracles, and has
determined that some of them are genuine. However, the Catholic Church
often has significant blinders, and definitely takes a long time to
adjust to obvious mistakes (Galileo anyone?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take, for example, &lt;a href="http://listverse.com/2008/07/14/top-10-astonishing-miracles/"&gt;this site on top 10 miracles&lt;/a&gt;. I've personally
researched about 3 or 4 of these, and it is quite clear that those are
definitely frauds (#1, 2, 3, and 5 I've checked). Yet, do we get any
retraction from the Catholic Church? Do we get &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; hint of skepticism?
None at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, I follow the same steps as above. I do not take someone else's
word, necessarily, and I don't discount them out of hand. The miracles
of Fatima are a great example. First, we have "visions" from highly
impressionable children, one of whom was known to have made up fanciful
stories in the recent past. These children are the only ones who "see"
it, until the last vision where hundreds claimed to see the "Miracle of
the Sun". The problem? The initial stories did not agree, and we only
get a semi-consistent story after the various witnesses spoke with each
other and to a priest collecting the reports. Check out &lt;a href="http://www.csicop.org/si/show/real_secrets_of_fatima/"&gt;The Real
Secrets of Fatima&lt;/a&gt; for the details. All of the elements spoken about
above can be seen - initial mundane experiences, misinterpretation of
known objects (i.e. the sun, and clouds), the exaggeration of stories in
later recollection, serious inconsistencies in reports and notable
non-reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same goes for every faith-healer I've read about. A little digging,
and a little skepticism, and the entire enterprise come crashing down.
Many times it doesn't take much digging!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the truth is there, then it shouldn't retreat under investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a matter of being &lt;em&gt;too skeptical&lt;/em&gt;. It is a matter of not
being credulous.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="wordpress_migration"></category></entry><entry><title>Creationist Math</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/May/10/creationist-math/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-05-10T18:36:00-04:00</published><updated>2013-05-10T18:36:00-04:00</updated><author><name>brianblais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2013-05-10:/posts/2013/May/10/creationist-math/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I got pointed to the &lt;a href="Institute%20for%20Creation%20Research"&gt;http://www.icr.org&lt;/a&gt;, which if you haven't
poked around on the site, you really should. It is quite interesting
(not really in a good way). However, I want to look at a &lt;a href="http://www.icr.org/article/a-7-billion-whyd-it-take-so-long/"&gt;particular
article on the young earth&lt;/a&gt;, arguing from population growth rates. The
relevant sentences are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using census records from the last 400 years and a bit of algebra, and
assuming a natural logarithmic growth, eight Flood survivors 4,500
years ago produce 7 billion people almost exactly. This is powerful
evidence that biblical history is accurate, and man-made evolutionary
history is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they footnote the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The formula for logarithmic human world population growth is &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;P&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;=&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;P&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;o&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;msup&gt;&lt;mi&gt;e&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;r&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;t&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;/msup&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex"&gt;P = Po e^{rt}&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.13889em;"&gt;P&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mrel"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut" style="height:0.7936em;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.13889em;"&gt;P&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;o&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist" style="height:0.7936em;"&gt;&lt;span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal mtight" style="margin-right:0.02778em;"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal mtight"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, where P = the current population, Po = the initial
population, e = the base of natural logarithms (2.718), r = the
average annual population growth rate (0.456% or 0.00456 in the
calculator), and t = the time interval from &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mi&gt;P&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;o&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex"&gt;P_o&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut" style="height:0.8333em;vertical-align:-0.15em;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.13889em;"&gt;P&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist" style="height:0.1514em;"&gt;&lt;span style="top:-2.55em;margin-left:-0.1389em;margin-right:0.05em;"&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal mtight"&gt;o&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist" style="height:0.15em;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;P&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex"&gt;P&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.13889em;"&gt;P&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, in the middle of the article, they are incredulous of the low
net birth rate in pre-agricultural human populations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the first human couple that supposedly evolved from ape-like
ancestors would have had only 6 million descendants after 2.4 million
years. This requires a population growth rate of about
0.000000009-essentially zero. Virtually no growth for 2.4 million
years?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how do we respond to this sort of analysis? One could try to simply
write it off as the rantings of a person blinded, by their religious
bias, to a true understanding of science.  However I prefer an
alternative approach. It may be tilting at windmills, but I prefer to
take a claim at face value, and see why it fails, and to ask followup
questions. Since the math here is so simple, it is easy to demonstrate
any errors, assumptions, etc.. and get to the bottom of it. So, someone
has made a claim, I don't agree, how do I proceed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="did-they-do-their-arithmetic-right-yes"&gt;Did they do their arithmetic right? Yes!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing I like to do is, assuming they are right in all of their
numbers, do they do the calculation correctly. This eliminates a pretty
obvious error that could have caused the problem. I suspected they got
it right, but I wanted to make sure. The math is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="katex-display"&gt;&lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math display="block" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;P&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;=&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mi&gt;P&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;o&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;msup&gt;&lt;mi&gt;e&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;r&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;t&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;/msup&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;r=0.00456
t=4500.0
Po=8.0

print Po*exp(r*t)/1e9,&amp;quot;billion&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yielding&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;6.52849018681&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;billion&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other direction is, how long ago were there only 8 people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\begin{eqnarray}&lt;br&gt;
P(t)&amp;amp;=&amp;amp;P_o \times e^{r\cdot t} \\&lt;br&gt;
\log P(t) &amp;amp;=&amp;amp; \log(P_o) + r\cdot t\\&lt;br&gt;
t&amp;amp;=&amp;amp; \frac{\log(P(t))-\log(P_o)}{r}&lt;br&gt;
\end{eqnarray}  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;Po=6.5e9  # current population
r=0.00456
P=8       # target population

t=(log(P)-log(Po))/r 
print t, &amp;quot;years&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;resulting in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;-4499.04089302 years.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="is-their-growth-rate-correct"&gt;Is their growth rate correct?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I am using &lt;a href="http://www.census.gov/population/international/data/worldpop/table_population.php"&gt;data from census.gov&lt;/a&gt;.  It is possible (in fact likely) that the original post used a slightly
different data set, but they didn't cite it so I can't confirm that. The
conclusions will not be qualitatively different, but that would be one
of the questions I'd have for the author (see below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is instructive to look at the data set both on a normal scale and a
log scale. The key thing here is that &lt;strong&gt;a constant growth rate
translates to a straight line on the log scale&lt;/strong&gt;. Let's see if this is
the case (see the lower of the two plots, especially):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="download" src="http://brianblais.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/download.png?w=640"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linear? Not so much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then chose a time-frame over which to calculate the average which gave
(for my data set) as close to their growth rate above - this is
essentially the growth rate consistent with the Biblical chronology. In
my data set that average is from 1300 to 2010, or 700 years (theirs,
they claim, it was 400 years so there is clearly a difference in data
sets here - however, they don't reference their actual data, and
regardless, this same analysis would work in their case too).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see from here that this average yields the Biblical number of
4500 years ago, but that it is clearly not a good assumption to think
that the growth rate, even over this time-frame, is constant. Because of
this, depending on how far back you do the averaging, you get a
&lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; time of the Flood. For example, the following show cases for
1600-2010, and 1950-2010. The last one is the closest to a constant
growth rate, but gives a ridiculous -1200 years back to 8 people!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(As an aside, Richard Dawkins does the same calculation with rats, and
comes up with an astonishing 1900 or so for the beginning of the Earth.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bottom-line"&gt;Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest problem with this calculation is assuming a constant growth
rate. Once it isn't constant, then the time-frame over which you
calculate the average makes a big difference. Only &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; possible
time-frame will result in something consistent with the Biblical
account, so one would have to justify:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why you can possibly assume constant growth rate in the distant past
    knowing it wasn't constant in the time-frame we know about.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even given a solid justification (which I don't believe actually
    exists...but I'm open to suggestions), you have to further justify
    why the &lt;em&gt;particular&lt;/em&gt; time average you take, that is consistent with
    the Biblical account, is the one you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; take.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can't use as a reason "because it's consistent with the Biblical
account", because the entire point is to &lt;em&gt;justify&lt;/em&gt; the Biblical account,
or to demonstrate that the data is consistent with it. It's not, if you
have to postulate that the Biblical account is correct, and choose the
specifics of the calculations to meet that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="questions-for-brian-thomas-ms-at-the-icr"&gt;Questions for Brian Thomas, M.S. at the ICR.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the questions I'd like answered. I'm not expecting any, but I'd
be thrilled to get one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What data set did you use? I'm sure it won't make any difference,
    but it is good to make sure that we all agree on the numbers.  I'd
    be happy to run my analysis through any data set that you provide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using your data set, and your analysis, do you confirm my
    observation that your result is sensitive to the time-frame (i.e.
    the 400 years in your case, 700 years in mine) over which you are
    obtaining your "average" growth rate?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it is, do you have a justification for using that, &lt;strong&gt;and only
    that&lt;/strong&gt;, time-frame?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you have a justification for using an average growth rate model
    in the face of data that clearly shows that the growth rate is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;
    constant?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id="questions-for-brian-thomas-ms-at-the-icr"&gt;Comment about Growth Rates before Agriculture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original article was astounded that the growth rate, prior to
agriculture, could be so low.  Essentially, they seem to believe that
exponential growth should have started once you had people, and gone at
a constant rate the entire time.  However, before agriculture, there
would have been a fairly low &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrying_capacity"&gt;carrying capacity&lt;/a&gt;, and human population
would follow &lt;a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LogisticEquation.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;logistic growth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, not exponential.  Near the carrying
capacity, the growth rate is essentially zero, exactly as observed.  A
little bit of reading on how populations &lt;em&gt;actually change&lt;/em&gt; might be
helpful to these people.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="wordpress_migration"></category><category term="Religion"></category><category term="Science"></category></entry><entry><title>Design, the Origin of Life, and Creationism</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/May/06/design-the-origin-of-life-and-creationism/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-05-06T20:50:00-04:00</published><updated>2013-05-06T20:50:00-04:00</updated><author><name>brianblais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2013-05-06:/posts/2013/May/06/design-the-origin-of-life-and-creationism/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just listened to a recent &lt;a href="http://www.premierradio.org.uk/shows/saturday/unbelievable.aspx"&gt;Unbelievable podcast&lt;/a&gt;, an episode about

scientific attempts at a naturalistic, non-design method for creating
the initial life on the planet have met with dead ends.  He further
added that this should make one start considering supernatural, design
methods for creating the initial life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from not understanding science, a question stuck in my head, and I
think the answer really shows the hand of these so-called intelligence
design "scientists" as religionists in disguise.  The question is the
following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you rule out all of the naturalistic, non-design explanations
[which we haven't, by the way], and if design is so evident in the
biological molecules, then the next step should be to consider and
rule out naturalistic &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;design&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; explanations…i.e. alien life
designed life on this planet.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is this explanation never raised by ID proponents?  They claim that
the "designer" is not, necessarily, God yet I never see them rule out
alien minds as the designers.  They jump from naturalistic, non-design
right over to supernatural "explanations".  I think, when pressed, they
would have to deal with alien design, and their true nature.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="wordpress_migration"></category></entry><entry><title>Consciousness in infants</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Apr/28/consciousness-in-infants/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-04-28T00:26:00-04:00</published><updated>2013-04-28T00:26:00-04:00</updated><author><name>brianblais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2013-04-28:/posts/2013/Apr/28/consciousness-in-infants/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've always been interested in the origin of consciousness, and am

in Science&lt;/a&gt; seems to address part of the origin of consciousness in
infants.  It makes you wonder what infant experience is like, and
perhaps the semi-conscious experience of dogs, cats, octopi, and
dolphins.  The abstract is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infants have a sophisticated behavioral and cognitive repertoire
suggestive of a capacity for conscious reflection. Yet, demonstrating
conscious access in infants remains challenging, mainly because they
cannot report their thoughts. Here, to circumvent this problem, we
studied whether an electrophysiological signature
of consciousness found in adults, corresponding to a late nonlinear
cortical response [\~300 milliseconds (ms)] to brief pictures, already
exists in infants. We recorded event-related potentials while 5-, 12-,
and 15-month-old infants (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 80) viewed masked faces at various
levels of visibility. In all age groups, we found a late slow wave
showing a nonlinear profile at the expected perceptual thresholds.
However, this late component shifted from a weak and delayed response
in 5-month-olds (starting around 900 ms) to a more sustained and
faster response in older infants (around 750 ms). These results reveal
that the brain mechanisms underlying the threshold for conscious
perception are already present in infancy but undergo a slow
acceleration during development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This weekend I got hooked on a &lt;a href="a-funny-little-probability-problem-correct.html"&gt;funny little probability puzzle&lt;/a&gt;, and
have finally found some closure. It started with an off-hand comment by
a student, which led me to think more deeply about the problem once I
actually worked it out. The problem was simple enough:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You draw two cards from a deck, and ask what is the probability that
the first is a black card, and the second is a jack. In math notation,
we want:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="katex-display"&gt;&lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math display="block" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;P&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo stretchy="false"&gt;(&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;B&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mn&gt;1&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mo separator="true"&gt;,&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;J&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mn&gt;2&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mo stretchy="false"&gt;)&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex"&gt;
 P(B1,J2)  
&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.13889em;"&gt;P&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mopen"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.05017em;"&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mpunct"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.1667em;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.09618em;"&gt;J&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mclose"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I compared &lt;em&gt;with replacement&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;without replacement&lt;/em&gt;, and got the same
answer, much to my surprise. After satisfying my surprise with a
numerical simulation, I thought, "there are clearly cases where it
&lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; make a difference between replacement and no replacement (drawing
two jacks, for example), so where does it matter?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="another-case"&gt;Another case&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I did another case:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You draw two cards from a deck, and ask what is the probability that
the first is a &lt;em&gt;face&lt;/em&gt; card, and the second is a jack. In math
notation, we want:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="katex-display"&gt;&lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math display="block" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;P&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo stretchy="false"&gt;(&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;F&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mn&gt;1&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mo separator="true"&gt;,&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;J&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mn&gt;2&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mo stretchy="false"&gt;)&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex"&gt;
 P(F1,J2)  
 &lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.13889em;"&gt;P&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mopen"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.13889em;"&gt;F&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mpunct"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.1667em;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.09618em;"&gt;J&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mclose"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-general-case"&gt;The General Case&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appeared to me that there was a pattern - some relationship between
the number of jacks, the number of cards, and the number of the
sub-population (color, face, etc...) such that the replacement and the

&lt;p&gt;or, in other words, for the replacement and non-replacement
probabilities to be the same in this simple game, the fraction of the
subpopulation to the deck has to be the same fraction as the jacks in
that subpopulation to the number of jacks. In the case of color, 1/2 the
deck is black and 1/2 the jacks are black. However, 3/13 of the deck are
face cards and 4/4 of the jacks are face cards. An interesting symmetry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, when there exists this symmetry, knowledge of the first
draw gives you no information about the second. I imagine there is some
fancy math theorem to this effect, but it is still pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="wordpress_migration"></category></entry><entry><title>A funny little probability problem - correct</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Mar/23/a-funny-little-probability-problem-correct/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-03-23T23:23:00-04:00</published><updated>2013-03-23T23:23:00-04:00</updated><author><name>brianblais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2013-03-23:/posts/2013/Mar/23/a-funny-little-probability-problem-correct/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="a-funny-little-probability-problem-4"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; I made a calculation error, which arrived at an
unintuitive result - a result that still stands. I got side-tracked
with, what I thought, was an arithmetic error. I wasn't satisfied,
because my intuition still thought that the without-replacement
probability should be a smidge higher, because of the reduction in the
number of cards. Because of this, I kept thinking about the problem to
see where it went wrong. I asked another faculty member the same
question, and although I didn't receive a full answer, it was enough to
figure out that I was on the right track initially, but was just a
little sloppy. So what went wrong, and why? Let me reproduce the
problem, and the &lt;em&gt;correct&lt;/em&gt; calculation this time, and then go on to see
the implications of the error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-problem"&gt;The problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You draw two cards from a deck, and ask what is the probability that the
first is a black card, and the second is a jack. In math notation, we
want:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="katex-error" style="color:#cc0000" title="ParseError: KaTeX parse error: Can't use function '$' in math mode at position 1: $̲   P(B1,J2)   "&gt;$  
P(B1,J2)  
&lt;/span&gt;$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-right-answer-and-how-i-know"&gt;The right answer, and how I know&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to be absolutely sure I had the right answer is to
simply outline every possible two-hand deal, and count the number of
cards in each case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="with-replacement"&gt;With replacement:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;Game&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;deals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;deck&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;makedeck&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;card2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;deck2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;deals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;card1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;card2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;found&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;deals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Black&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;rank&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The length of "found" is 104, and the length of the "deals" is 2704 (52

&lt;span class="n"&gt;found&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;deals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Black&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;rank&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The length of "found" is 102, and the length of the "deals" is 2652 (52
x 51), which is the &lt;em&gt;same&lt;/em&gt; fraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="with-replacement_1"&gt;With replacement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This part was correct, and just repeated here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In replacement, we replace the first card after drawing it, reshuffle,
and then draw the second. Thus the two events are independent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference comes from the term like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="katex-error" style="color:#cc0000" title="ParseError: KaTeX parse error: Can't use function '$' in math mode at position 1: $̲   P(J2|B1,J1)P…"&gt;$  
P(J2|B1,J1)P(J1|B1)  
&lt;/span&gt;$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;incorrect&lt;/em&gt; version, we had&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="katex-error" style="color:#cc0000" title="ParseError: KaTeX parse error: Can't use function '$' in math mode at position 1: $̲   P(J2|B1,J1)P…"&gt;$  
P(J2|B1,J1)P(J1)  
&lt;/span&gt;$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, I was being sloppy, and forgot to copy the right-hand side
of the conditional, without the &lt;em&gt;B1&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I find interesting, which is why I've gone to such a detail, are
the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how easy it is to make simple arithmetic mistakes in these sorts of
    problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how easy it is to have a subtle rewrite of a problem, and get a
    different answer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how a simulation gives a lot of confidence in a result&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've found, over time, that I don't tend to trust mathematical results
without a numerical result to support it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, it is a cool result, and still somewhat unintuitive - at least at
first. Thinking in terms of information, it makes sense - knowing that
the first card is black tells you nothing about the rank of the second
card.  &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="wordpress_migration"></category></entry><entry><title>A funny little probability problem</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Mar/23/a-funny-little-probability-problem-4/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-03-23T12:21:00-04:00</published><updated>2013-03-23T12:21:00-04:00</updated><author><name>brianblais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2013-03-23:/posts/2013/Mar/23/a-funny-little-probability-problem-4/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Note: this problem has an error...can you find it?

&lt;p&gt;We often make the important distinction between drawing cards with or
without replacement when determining the results of card games. Clearly,
if you draw a Jack, then the probability of drawing another Jack is
different whether you replace and shuffle, or you leave the drawn Jack
out. In an extreme case, imagine a deck with only one Jack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After going through an example in class, and applying replacement, a
student asked about the same example without replacement. I didn't have
time to go over the example in class, but I sketched how the calculation
would be different, and would yield a different answer. After class,
going through the calculation, I was in for a surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-problem"&gt;The problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You draw two cards from a deck, and ask what is the probability that the
first is a black card, and the second is a jack. In math notation, we
want:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="katex-error" style="color:#cc0000" title="ParseError: KaTeX parse error: Can't use function '$' in math mode at position 1: $̲   P(B1,J2)   "&gt;$  
P(B1,J2)  
&lt;/span&gt;$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="with-replacement"&gt;With replacement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In replacement, we replace the first card after drawing it, reshuffle,
and then draw the second. Thus the two events are independent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="katex-error" style="color:#cc0000" title="ParseError: KaTeX parse error: Can't use function '$' in math mode at position 1: $̲   \begin{array…"&gt;$  
\begin{array}{rcl}  
P(B1,J2|{\rm replace}) &amp;amp;=&amp;amp; P(B1) \times P(J2) \\  
&amp;amp;=&amp;amp;\frac{26}{52} \times \frac{4}{52} = 0.0385  
\end{array}  
&lt;/span&gt;$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="without-replacement"&gt;Without replacement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without replacement is a little trickier to set up, because the second
draw depends on the first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="katex-error" style="color:#cc0000" title="ParseError: KaTeX parse error: Can't use function '$' in math mode at position 1: $̲   \begin{array…"&gt;$  
\begin{array}{rcl}  
P(B1,J2|{\rm no-replace}) &amp;amp;=&amp;amp; P(B1) \times P(J2|B1) \\  
&amp;amp;=&amp;amp;\frac{26}{52} \times
\left(P(J2|B1,J1)P(J1)+P(J2|B1,\overline{J1})P(\overline{J1})
\right)\\  
&amp;amp;=&amp;amp;\frac{26}{52} \times \left(\frac{3}{51} \cdot
\frac{4}{52}+\frac{4}{51} \cdot \frac{48}{52} \right)\\  
&amp;amp;=&amp;amp;\frac{26}{52} \times \left(\frac{204}{51\cdot 52} \right)\\  
&amp;amp;=&amp;amp;0.0385  
\end{array}  
&lt;/span&gt;$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the same answer!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Note: this problem has an error...can you find it? I will post the

properties)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only conclusions are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My intuition fails me sometimes, on even simple problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drawing a black card on the first draw tells you no more information
    about drawing a jack on the second (or any other number, for that
    matter).  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cool!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want some entertainment in the form of logical gymnastics, go to
&lt;a href="http://www.proofthatgodexists.org/"&gt;this page on the proof of god&lt;/a&gt;. If you're impatient, here is one of
the arguments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you believe that Absolute Truth exists? Possible answers…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;yes -&amp;gt; you go on to the next piece&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;no -&amp;gt; is it absolutely true that absolute truth doesn't exist?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;yes -&amp;gt; then you actually believe that absolute truth exists!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no -&amp;gt; you get asked again if you believe that Absolute Truth
    exists (with the statement "This is not a glitch (Think about
    it)". - essentially implying either that you're making an
    absolute truth statement, or you can't state anything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don't know -&amp;gt; Is this absolutely true?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no -&amp;gt; you get asked again if you believe that Absolute Truth
    exists (with the statement "This is not a glitch (Think about
    it)". - essentially implying either that you're making an
    absolute truth statement, or you can't state anything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don't care -&amp;gt; send you out of the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A similar point is made about the laws of logic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; "If you believe that laws of logic do not exist, how do you make
decisions about the most basic things in life? How do you decide which
side of the road to drive on? How do you choose whether to drink water
or poison for nourishment? &amp;gt; &amp;gt; One interesting aspect of denying laws
of logic, like the law of non-contradiction, is that since you DO NOT
believe in laws of logic, you actually DO believe in laws of logic. If
contradictions are allowed in your worldview then so is that one."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="why-this-is-stupid"&gt;Why this is stupid&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the first basic flaw in this line of argument is that it assumes
that all statements are yes/no statements. There is no accounting for
probability, uncertainty, etc… Does "Absolute Truth" exist? I don't
know? Is it absolutely true that I don't know? I don't know!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second basic flaw is that it may not be a well-defined question.
What does "absolute" really mean? What about "truth"? We have working
definitions, which might be a bit sloppy, but perhaps if we understood
them better we'd find that they are not well defined concepts. An
analogy in physics might be the word "particle". We have a working
definition, and in most cases it is very usable, but we know that
fundamentally we just have energy and interactions - the particle is a
convenient construct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I don't think I have any patience for arguments which don't
even make an attempt to be grounded in some empiricism.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="wordpress_migration"></category><category term="Logic"></category><category term="Probability"></category><category term="Religion"></category></entry><entry><title>Resurrection, Linear Regression, and the Art of Harmonization</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Feb/15/resurrection-linear-regression-and-the-art-of-harmonization/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-02-15T21:41:00-05:00</published><updated>2013-02-15T21:41:00-05:00</updated><author><name>brianblais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2013-02-15:/posts/2013/Feb/15/resurrection-linear-regression-and-the-art-of-harmonization/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dan Barker has an &lt;a href="http://ffrf.org/legacy/books/lfif/?t=stone"&gt;Easter Challenge&lt;/a&gt; to any Christian to come up with

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conditions of the challenge …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dan Barker has an &lt;a href="http://ffrf.org/legacy/books/lfif/?t=stone"&gt;Easter Challenge&lt;/a&gt; to any Christian to come up with
a seamless account of what happened on the day of the Resurrection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conditions of the challenge are simple and reasonable. In each of
the four Gospels, begin at Easter morning and read to the end of the
book: Matthew 28, Mark 16, Luke 24, and John 20-21. Also read Acts
1:3-12 and Paul's tiny version of the story in I Corinthians 15:3-8.
These 165 verses can be read in a few moments. Then, without omitting
a single detail from these separate accounts, write a simple,
chronological narrative of the events between the resurrection and the
ascension: what happened first, second, and so on; who said what,
when; and where these things happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the gospels do not always give precise times of day, it is
permissible to make educated guesses. The narrative does not have to
pretend to present a perfect picture--it only needs to give at least
one plausible account of all of the facts. Additional explanation of
the narrative may be set apart in parentheses. &lt;em&gt;The important
condition to the challenge, however, is that not one single biblical
detail be omitted.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy Bannister &lt;a href="http://www.answering-islam.org/Andy/Resurrection/harmony.html#presuppositions"&gt;has this description&lt;/a&gt;, which really is consistent with
every detail, and supposed contradiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the problem with this method that Andy uses?  It is helpful to
consider a similar situation that arrises in mathematics, in the process
of regression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="regression"&gt;Regression&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In linear regression, I might have, say, a handful of data points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;X&lt;/strong&gt;   &lt;strong&gt;Y&lt;/strong&gt;
  0.0     -12.5
  1.0     17.9
  2.0     -3.2
  3.0     11.4
  4.0     10.8
  5.0     28.8
  6.0     31.8
  7.0     28.3
  8.0     23.4
  9.0     21.9
  10.0    32.7&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is plotted as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Fig1" src="http://brianblais.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/fig1.png" title="fig1.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we do a linear regression, we fit to a standard "y=mx+b" form. For
this data, the best fit is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;y=3.4 x + 0.27,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;with a mean squared error of 77.9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Fig2" src="http://brianblais.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/fig2.png" title="fig2.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, not a bad looking fit. However, if we fit to a 10-th power
polynomial, we can get even better!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;            10          9          8         7         6         5
-0.0007039 x  + 0.0363 x - 0.8051 x + 10.04 x - 77.13 x + 376.5 x

         4        3        2
 - 1159 x + 2152 x - 2163 x + 891.8 x - 12.54
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;with a Mean Squared Error of Zero!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Fig4" src="http://brianblais.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/fig4.png" title="fig4.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the field of statistics, this is referred to as over-fitting, and is
the result of fitting the noise. In other words, it is fitting the
meaningless differences from one point to another by adding a tunable
parameter for each detail in the data. With each new parameter we get a
"better" fit, by the criterion of mean squared error, but we lose sight
of the meaning. This is the mathematical equivalent of losing sight of
the forest for the trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="back-to-the-resurrection"&gt;Back to the Resurrection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we look at Andy Bannister's very clever solution, we notice something
quite interesting: for every single difference between the Gospel
accounts, he adds a detail not found in the story to explain it. One can
pretty much do this for any two accounts that don't say logically
contradictory things, and can be seen as an example of over-fitting. I
think it highlights two things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​1) The challenge is probably not a very good one. One can Rube-Goldberg
a story together to fit any amount of details&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​2) People will go to great lengths harmonizing something that they have
a vested interest in believing.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="wordpress_migration"></category></entry><entry><title>There is no population</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Feb/13/there-is-no-population/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-02-13T01:07:00-05:00</published><updated>2013-02-13T01:07:00-05:00</updated><author><name>brianblais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2013-02-13:/posts/2013/Feb/13/there-is-no-population/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I've been following and intro stats class for a project of mine, and

everyone in a state, would that data represent population data or sample
data?  It becomes clear that the population is a theoretical concept
only, made-up to make a sampling distribution make sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More and more I find the Bayesian perspective demonstrably clearer. 
Sure, a statistic is a property of a sample of data.  A parameter is
always, however, a property of the model.  There is never a dividing
line here, and the limits of inference come down to the limits of the
model, and the limits of the data in constraining the parameters of the
model.  There is no population.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="wordpress_migration"></category></entry><entry><title>"Science Refutes God" Debate</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2012/Dec/11/science-refutes-god-debate/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-12-11T13:49:00-05:00</published><updated>2012-12-11T13:49:00-05:00</updated><author><name>brianblais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2012-12-11:/posts/2012/Dec/11/science-refutes-god-debate/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just finished watching the "Science Refutes God" debate.  Although I

am not a huge fan of Krauss and Shermer, I thought they did a decent
job.  As I was watching, I nearly jumped out of my seat with some
arm-chair quaterbacking..."ask this next!!!".  D'Sousa claimed that the
Bible predicted the Big Bang (i.e. universe from nothing) thousands of
years before science.  He also admitted that the day and night before
the Sun was not true (around 1 hr and 20 minutes in), was refuted by
science, and was really the product of a fundamentalist reading of the
bible.  The next question out of Krauss' mouth should have been, "by
what criterea do you decide what is true in the Bible?"  What D'Sousa
was doing was saying that, where we have learned things from science and
one can plausibly read the Bible in the same way, then that is true in
the Bible.  Otherwise, it is false in the Bible.  In this case, the
Bible is making &lt;strong&gt;no&lt;/strong&gt; predictions, because it has many claims which
cannot be demonstrated to be true except through science.  It's like you
rattle off a whole series of random digits, like (and I did this by
computer):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3, 6, 4, 3, 1, 0, 2, 9, 7, 8, 6, 4, 1, 1, 6, 8, 9, 5, 3, 4, 0, 6, 9, 9,
4, 6, 4, 9, 6, 9, 3, 8, 6, 8, 3, 9, 6, 9, 8, 1, 4, 0, 9, ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and then noting, hey, this starts with a "3", and look at some of the
other digits (in bold):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt;, 6, 4, 3, &lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;, 0, 2, 9, 7, 8, 6, &lt;strong&gt;4&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;, 1, 6, 8, 9,
&lt;strong&gt;5&lt;/strong&gt;, 3, 4, 0, 6, &lt;strong&gt;9&lt;/strong&gt;, 9, 4, &lt;strong&gt;6&lt;/strong&gt;, 4, 9, 6, 9, 3, 8, 6, 8, 3, 9, 6,
9, 8, 1, 4, 0, 9, ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you see the digits of pi!  (a small note - I was planning on running the
random number generator many times, to make sure that this example
started with 3, to make my point about the starting value, and lo! it
came up the first time anyway!)&lt;/p&gt;

colloquial use.  We see that in physics a lot, with terms like energy,
force, and heat, and one has to be very careful when using these terms.
 In the podcast, they used the example of people using the word
"logical", as in "that is the logical thing to do".  The host thought
this should really mean "that is the &lt;em&gt;reasonable&lt;/em&gt; thing to do", given
that they aren't generally doing a deductive proof to make the decision.
 The tone he used was that this should be obvious...however it is
not...it is wrong.  Why should the word "logical" be restricted to
&lt;em&gt;deductive&lt;/em&gt; logic?  Why should it not include inductive logic?  Pretty
much that pulls in all of &lt;a href="http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/prob/book.pdf"&gt;probability theory&lt;/a&gt;, and it then becomes
(nearly) synonymous with "reasonable".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I say the two phrases in my head, I do sense a subtle differerence,
with "logical" being more definititive than "reasonable".  Perhaps it is
more of a difference like "probable" and "plausible" - still not a
deductive distinction, but a distinction of magnitude in inductive
reasoning.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, it is an interesting thing to think about how we use language in
science and society.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="wordpress_migration"></category></entry><entry><title>God does Not Exist, Clearly</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2012/Nov/26/god-does-not-exist-clearly/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-11-26T10:34:00-05:00</published><updated>2012-11-26T10:34:00-05:00</updated><author><name>brianblais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2012-11-26:/posts/2012/Nov/26/god-does-not-exist-clearly/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="http://brianblais.wordpress.com/2012/11/25/a-longish-discussion-on-facebook-about-god-science-and-philosophy/"&gt;a facebook conversation&lt;/a&gt;, Matthew Bell claimed that "the evidence

for the existence of God has been made so clear that any who do not
believe in it are without excuse before him and are in denial of the
evidence."  He then &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;amp;v=KbbE8ZLzcRk"&gt;pointed me to a lecture by William Lane
Craig&lt;/a&gt; (WLC), where this evidence is laid out.  Let's look at this
supposedly clear evidence.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-argument"&gt;The Argument&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WLC starts by looking at 7 things that point to something more than
naturalism.  I interject a few criticisms, but many more can be found
online.  My main point is stated at the bottom of this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​1. "Why is there something rather than nothing?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="white-space:pre;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;"Everything that exists has an
explanation, either in the necessity of its own being, or in a cause."
 He claims that this point is plausible, at least more than its
contradiction, and then proceeds to give a straightforward,
everyday-sort of analogy.  I think we have learned in the last 100 years
that these analogies are completely useless once you move a little bit
away from everyday experience - really big, really small, really fast,
really old, etc...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He continues with "Some things exist necessarily (say, numbers) without
any cause.  All other things have an external cause (say, mountains,
planets, etc...)."  He then says that it seems plausible that the
explanation of the universe is an external cause.  Why?  No reason is
given.  He then goes on to state that that cause must be transcendent
and personal.  The cause must be greater than the uiniverse, and thus
 cannot be physical or material.  Only two kinds of things are
non-physical: an abstract object and an intelligent mind (i.e. an
unbodied consciousness).  Why only these two?  No attempt to expand this
list is given.  Can you claim that the mind could even exist without
material?  No support for is given.  These are simply asserted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​2. Origin of the universe.  Does the universe have a beginning?  Here
he uses his standard rant against the actual infinite (transfinite
arithmetic), then introduces the Big Bang evidence, and then the Borde,
Guth, and Vilenkin theorem.  A nice treatment of this can be found
&lt;a href="http://debunkingwlc.wordpress.com/2010/07/14/borde-guth-vilenkin/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but there are many others online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An appeal is made to the "out of nothing, nothing comes" as very
successful in science - again, ignoring the uncaused events in quantum
physics, to which Vilinkin himself references in his original paper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="white-space:pre;"&gt;He continues with, "the cause must be
c&lt;/span&gt;hangeless, timeless, spaceless, and personal".  Again, he says
that it is "plausibly" personal.  "How else could a timeless cause give
rise to a temporal effect like a beginning?"  A theme is happening - at
each stage of his argument he is appealing to our ordinary sense of
things, our incredulity, and our lack of any curiousity.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​3. Fine tuning argument.  His only response to the physical necessity
of these constants being what they are is "the physical necessity of the
constants being fine tuned is implausible because 'these constants are
independent in the theory'".  This is entirely unconvicing, given that
the theory is known to be incomplete!  True, right now, the constants
are indendent but that is simply because they are not derived in any way
from a more fundamental understanding.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​4. Argument from objective moral values and duties.  I think &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=video&amp;amp;cd=2&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;ved=0CEIQtwIwAQ&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ted.com%2Ftalks%2Fsam_harris_science_can_show_what_s_right.html&amp;amp;ei=qJy0UM-vM-Xw0gG90oD4BQ&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNEj9tFXYKdx8uZ_XVjOYruVQUB1RA"&gt;Sam
Harris' arguments for objective morality&lt;/a&gt;, based on science, are more
convincing than Craig's here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​5. Argument from the "greatest possible conceivable being".  This
argument is essentially "If I can imagine it, it must exist" (yes, I
know that's an oversimplification) He claims that this entire argument,
except the first point "God could possible exist",  is uncontentious.
 He then says that the atheist must demonstrate that the concept of God
is incoherent (like a married bachelor) to demonstrate that God could
not possibly exist.  He then argues from incredulity (again) - "what do
you think?"  "It seems to me that an all-good, all powerful being is
coherent.", etc...  I can't imagine anyone is ever convinced by such
wordplay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​6. Historical details of Jesus.  WLC claims that most historials agree
with the following three historical points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="white-space:pre;"&gt;&lt;span style="white-space:pre;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;a) empty tomb&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="white-space:pre;"&gt;&lt;span style="white-space:pre;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;b) postmortem appearances&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="white-space:pre;"&gt;&lt;span style="white-space:pre;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;c) transformation of the desciples (i.e they
were&lt;span style="white-space:pre;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;willing to die for them.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first response, as I was listening to this was, whoa!  We just jumped
about 13 billion years!  Up to this point we were talking about the
origins of matter and the universe, and now we jump to a mere 2000 years
ago.  I really like the response by &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVMgvw4QV4g&amp;amp;feature=relmfu"&gt;Robert M Price here&lt;/a&gt;, where he
deals quite well with the development of legendary material. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​7. Personal experience of God.  WLC admits this isn't evidence.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-point"&gt;The Point&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not my point to criticize WLC arguments for their content.  I've
sketched some criticisms here, as they appear to me, but my main
contention is that this evidence is &lt;em&gt;not clear evidence for God&lt;/em&gt;.
 Matthew Bell claimed that "the evidence for the existence of God has
been made so clear that any who do not believe in it are without excuse
before him and are in denial of the evidence.", and yet this evidence is
not at all clear.  It relates either to the edge of our understanding on
cosmology, 2000 year old texts written decades after the events by
people who do not claim to be eyewitnesses, or "feel-good" feelings when
you do something nice for someone or pray.   In each case the evidence
is either at our ignorance or our subjectivity, and not clear.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what would I want?  For example, before Darwin, there was clear
evidence for design.  Any person could easily see it with their eyes, it
was demonstrable in, literally, millions of ways.  Watching a beaver
build a dam, or a parsitic wasp infect a caterpillar, the match of
function and form was truly obvious.  Of course, once Darwin
demonstrated that this could be explained without a designer, it ceased
to be evidence for a designer - but it was clear evidence at the time.
 So-called faith-healings would also provide clear evidence, if they
could be repeated and not easily explained with human psychology and the
science of placebo, etc...  It would be evidence that anyone could
approach and deal with, and would point beyond the natural world
(perhaps).  However, this evidence seems to retreat under the slightest
skeptical scrutiny.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about evidence for something else, perhaps not an everyday
phenomenon?  What about the Big Bang?  Is there clear evidence for it?
 Yes!  Of course, it's a little more work to see it, but I can get
middle-school students to be able to do the math, measuring red-shifts,
and calculate the age of the universe - from real data!  This is clear
evidence - the very thing that is lacking when we are talking about the
supposed creator of the universe who supposedly still acts in the world.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="wordpress_migration"></category></entry><entry><title>A few things about Carl Sagan</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2012/Nov/09/a-few-things-about-carl-sagan/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-11-09T16:29:00-05:00</published><updated>2012-11-09T16:29:00-05:00</updated><author><name>brianblais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2012-11-09:/posts/2012/Nov/09/a-few-things-about-carl-sagan/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's Carl Sagan day, so it is worth to pause for a moment to remember

present evidence that even very young children think in a Bayesian way.
 The discussion centers around contrasting children and adults in terms
of the priors they have when approaching a new problem.  Gelman makes
the point that the failures in adults can also occur because out
internal models tend to be discrete and the real-world is continious.
 It is very interesting to see how these sorts of mappings from theory
to reality are made.  In general, how do we infer what internal
representations of models we are actually employing? &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="wordpress_migration"></category></entry><entry><title>Great Science Ads!</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2012/Oct/16/great-science-ads/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-10-16T12:44:00-04:00</published><updated>2012-10-16T12:44:00-04:00</updated><author><name>brianblais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2012-10-16:/posts/2012/Oct/16/great-science-ads/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Check out the pictures at the bottom of &lt;a href="http://www.scienceworld.ca/ads"&gt;this science museum's site&lt;/a&gt;.

who had a near-death experience, states that he is convinced that heaven
actually exists, and that science is wrong about the origin of
consciousness and what happens after death.  His argument:  "But as far
as I know, no one before me has ever traveled to this dimension (a)
while their cortex was completely shut down, and (b) while their body
was under minute medical observation, as mine was for the full seven
days of my coma."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowhere, however, does he seem to consider that, perhaps, his
hallucination could have happened in the brief interval of the cortex
shutting down or the interval of him waking up.  Even if he
&lt;em&gt;experienced&lt;/em&gt; days away in paradise doesn't mean that the actual
experience lasted at all during the time that his cortex was confirmed
to be inactive.  Since this possibility took me a whole 10 seconds to
think of (and there could be others) it is clear he is not being
critical about, what is most likely, a very moving experience for him.
 I do not begrudge him this experience, and would love to have one
myself (if it didn't involved the significant risk of actually dying in
the process), but I would be loathe to make universal metaphysical
claims from this experience.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/this-must-be-heaven"&gt;nice response&lt;/a&gt; to this, as always, comes from Sam Harris.  Here Sam
Harris says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alexander asserts that the cessation of cortical activity was “clear
from the severity and duration of my meningitis, and from the global
cortical involvement documented by CT scans and neurological
examinations....The problem, however, is that “CT scans and
neurological examinations” can’t determine neuronal inactivity—in the
cortex or anywhere else. And Alexander makes no reference to
functional data that might have been acquired by fMRI, PET, or EEG—nor
does he seem to realize that only this sort of evidence could support
his case....whatever structural damage appeared on CT could not have
been “global.”...Coma is not associated with the complete cessation of
cortical activity, in any case. And to my knowledge, almost no one
thinks that consciousness is purely a matter of cortical activity. &lt;/p&gt;

and Don Johnson&lt;/a&gt;), that the reason a skeptic doesn't believe the
Resurrection of Jesus is that they have a presupposition against
miracles, or the supernatural, and simply discount it on principle.
 There are two mistakes with this idea, which I find illustrative of
ignorance of proper scientific thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of these biases against miracles are &lt;em&gt;learned from evidence&lt;/em&gt;,
    as most miracle claims come up empty.  So it is not an &lt;em&gt;irrational&lt;/em&gt;
    bias, but a &lt;em&gt;rational&lt;/em&gt; one, based on life experience. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It shouldn't matter anyway - if something is true, then one should
    be able to convince even a skeptic.  And it is perfectly natural to
    distrust extraordinary claims, and it is the job of the claimant to
    make the case.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought of two examples from my life where I was skeptical of an
extraordinary claim, one where it turned out my perspective was correct
and the other not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the 1990's, the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerating_universe"&gt;first evidence for the acclerating universe&lt;/a&gt;
    came out.  I remember thinking, "No way this is true."  At the time,
    I thought their calibration of the supernovae used as standard
    candles was somehow incorrect.  Did the researchers approach this
    skepticism with "oh, you just are biased against theories that
    propose unknown external forces, or violations of known laws"?  No.
     Other groups repeated it, they confirmed any calibration, and came
    up with a theoretical structure (using the Cosmological Constant) to
    describe it.  Then I was convinced.  Was I wrong in my skepticism?
     Absolutely not.  The response to skeptics is to bring the evidence
    to bear on it.  If the evidence is not enough to convince a
    reasonable skeptic, then we can't be particularly confident in it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recently, there was some data indicating possibly faster-than-light
    neutrinos.  &lt;a href="https://brianblais.wordpress.com/2011/10/14/faster-than-light-why-the-lawyer-is-wrong/"&gt;I had a response to this here&lt;/a&gt;, where I was skeptical
    of the result.  Again, it was a group of careful scientists who had
    done the measurments, and had taken into account everything they
    could think of.  I still didn't believe it.  Did the researchers
    approach this skepticism with "oh, you just are biased against
    theories that propose unknown external forces, or violations of
    known laws"?  No.  Others tried to analyze the same data and the set
    up, and the scientists explored other explanations.   &lt;a href="http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2012/02/breaking-news-error-undoes-faster.html"&gt;Turned out to
    be a loose cable&lt;/a&gt;.  Here again, my skepticism was well placed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not bias to be skeptical.  It isn't irrational to demand a
higher-than-average standard for extraordinary claims, no matter what.
 If you make such a claim, and that higher-than-average standard is not
met, then you cannot be confident in that claim.  It doesn't matter
whether the claim is religious or scientific, the same rules apply.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="wordpress_migration"></category></entry><entry><title>Aliens!</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2012/Sep/07/aliens/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-09-07T09:57:00-04:00</published><updated>2012-09-07T09:57:00-04:00</updated><author><name>brianblais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2012-09-07:/posts/2012/Sep/07/aliens/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here is an interesting attempt to make the Drake equation more

regularly posting, now that the semester is starting.  I'm also testing
out new posting tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as a beginning, I start with an extract from an introductory
statistics class:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://brianblais.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/pastedgraphic-1-1.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a strong feeling that this was a job for probability, not for
statistics, so I thought, how would one do this problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="white-space:pre;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;We observe  h1=4, N1=10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="white-space:pre;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;What is the probability of h2,
N2=100?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that the "probability" approach would be more fruitful, so I
threw together this little calculation, where I simply marginalize over
the single "random coin" parameter, given data 1 (our initial data) and
look at the probability of various h2's:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="1" src="http://brianblais.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/untitled11.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;since&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="2" src="http://brianblais.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/untitled-2.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which also arises in the normalization condition for the beta
distribution.  This leads to our final solution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="3" src="http://brianblais.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/untitled-3.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which leads to the following plot, for h1=4, N1=10, and N2=100:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="4" src="http://brianblais.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/untitled-4.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't help but think there is a simplification of the equation, but I
don't see anything obvious that cancels.  Certainly, for large N's I
could approximate it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it is clearly a problem for probability not statistics...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want some entertainment in the form of logical gymnastics, go to
this page on the proof of god. If you're impatient, here is one of the
arguments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you believe that Absolute Truth exists? Possible answers…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​1. yes -&amp;gt; you go on to the next piece 2. no -&amp;gt; is it absolutely true
that absolute truth doesn't exist? 1. yes -&amp;gt; then you actually believe
that absolute truth exists! 2. no -&amp;gt; you get asked again if you believe
that Absolute Truth exists (with the statement "This is not a glitch
(Think about it)". - essentially implying either that you're making an
absolute truth statement, or you can't state anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A similar point is made about the laws of logic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If you believe that laws of logic do not exist, how do you make
decisions about the most basic things in life? How do you decide which
side of the road to drive on? How do you choose whether to drink water
or poison for nourishment?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One interesting aspect of denying laws of logic, like the law of
non-contradiction, is that since you DO NOT believe in laws of logic,
you actually DO believe in laws of logic. If contradictions are allowed
in your worldview then so is that one."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This form of presuppositionalist argument pretty much says that without
God there can not be laws of logic, and thus to even have a worldview
presupposes the existence of God. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why this is stupid&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that comes to mind in this type of argument is that there is a
serious fallacy of the excluded middle.  Do you believe that absolute
truth exists?  How about "I don't know" or "you haven't defined absolute
or truth, so the question doesn't make sense".  I'm not convinced that
they can be defined  in such a way that I'd be confident in them.  What
we have at bottom are sensory experiences , and what model of the
universe is most consistent with that sensory experience.  I have little
patience for purely philosophical arguments that aren't tied to what we
know from science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing that comes to mind is that this argument, at best, gets
you to a deism.  The only part that even attempts to get to a Christian
god is the moral argument, and that has its own problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a few thoughts on this, mostly silly, line of arguments.  Any
takers to defend it?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="wordpress_migration"></category></entry><entry><title>Lessons From Bayes' Rule</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2012/Jun/03/lessons-from-bayes-rule/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-06-03T23:25:00-04:00</published><updated>2012-06-03T23:25:00-04:00</updated><author><name>brianblais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2012-06-03:/posts/2012/Jun/03/lessons-from-bayes-rule/</id><summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;

I was thinking of some of the not-so-mathematical lessons we learn from
Bayes' Rule.  I'd like to include actual examples for each, and how it
maps onto the various pieces of Bayes' Rule, but I figured I'd put up my
list here and add to it as I think of it.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Confidence in a claim should scale with the evidence for that claim&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ockham's razor - simpler theories are preferred (i.e. you pay a
    marginalization penalty for each parameter, across its prior)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simpler means fewer adjustable parameters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simpler means that the predictions are both &lt;em&gt;specific&lt;/em&gt; and not
    &lt;em&gt;overly plastic&lt;/em&gt;. For example, a hypothesis which is consistent with
    the observed data, and also be consistent if the data were the
    opposite as well would be overly plastic.  Arguing for the God
    hypothesis, saying that a universe fine tuned for life is evidence
    for design is a hypothesis which is overly plastic.  If our universe
    were not fine tuned for life, and life is exceptional, then that too
    would be evidence for design - thus the data, and its opposite, are
    covered by the hypothesis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your inference is only as good as the hypotheses that you consider.
     If you consider only randomness and psychic, then nearly every
    octopus will be psychic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is better to explicitly display your assumptions rather than
    implicitly hold them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is a &lt;em&gt;good thing&lt;/em&gt; to update your beliefs when you receive new
    information, and not a sign of waffling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not all uncertainties are the same.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is very typical of "science" that doesn't work. You get a group of
devout people supporting it who claim that the scientific establishment
is unfair, is shunning their research, is not allowing them to present
at conferences, is suppressing their ideas and they want a level playing
field. I've seen the same whining and crying from people supporting
Intelligent Design and people supporting UFOs and people supporting
psychics. It is true, that the scientific establishment will not publish
papers for these people, given the (lack of) evidence they show. It is
biased against ideas with little supporting evidence. It is, however,
not &lt;em&gt;unfairly&lt;/em&gt; biased, and least not typically. Scientists are humans,
and so you do get the occasional overzealous skepticism. That's actually
not a bad thing. As Carl Sagan said, extraordinary claims require
extraordinary evidence. It is incumbent on these people to support their
claims with the proper amount of evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If, for example, it was absolutely clear that cold fusion worked then it
would be trivial to convert even the most hardened skeptic. If one had
convincing evidence for psychic phenomena or ufos or intelligent design,
it would become mainstream science and be very easy to convince people.
The problem is that these topics are on the fringe, their claims
extraordinary, are physical implausible, and the evidence for their
existence is terrible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you hear about ideas suppressed by the scientific you should
immediately think "unlikely, unsupported claim", despite what the
claimants are saying. If the evidence is strong enough, it will convince
the skeptics. Both quantum mechanics and relativity are totally weird,
and those went from nothing to the dominant idea within a decade because
of the strength of the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="wordpress_migration"></category></entry><entry><title>Free Will and Entropy</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2012/May/07/free-will-and-entropy/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-05-07T10:04:00-04:00</published><updated>2012-05-07T10:04:00-04:00</updated><author><name>brianblais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2012-05-07:/posts/2012/May/07/free-will-and-entropy/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In Sam Harris’ &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;amp;v=pCofmZlC72g"&gt;talk on free will&lt;/a&gt;, we have the following comment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“if we caught a serial killer, we’d assume his responsibility because
of his ability to have chosen otherwise. if we then discovered that he
had a brain tumor which we could determine resulted in homicidal
behavior, we’d determine that he was not responsible - that he was a
victim of biology. this, however, is just a special case of any
biological brain state - if we could know for certain how brain states
generated behavior, we would just as certainly determine that he was
not responsible for his actions and is just a victim of biology”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have two parts of knowledge needed here: know for certain the current
state and how (in detail) that state progresses to the macroscopic
outcomes. From this we have a sort of determinism that is inconsistent
with a simple notion of “free will”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I happened to be teaching the concept of entropy in my physics
class at the same time I watched this, and I was struck by the parallel.
I had thought of this before, last year, but never wrote about it. The
concept of entropy arises when we don’t know the details of every single
molecule in a system, knowing only some gross average features like the
average energy or pressure. If we knew the current state of the system
perfectly, and knew the laws of physics to forecast from that state,
then we’d be able to reverse any process. However, given our lack of
knowledge, the system moves in the single direction of increasing
entropy, where the the energy is spread out the most, and the system has
access to the most number of micro states consistent with the macro
states we actually measure. The system is described in a
non-deterministic way, even if all of the laws of physics underlying the
motion of the molecules is entirely deterministic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps our feeling of “free will” is real, in the same sense that
entropy is real - it’s a non-deterministic description despite the
underlying deterministic processes, arising from our practical lack of
knowledge of the perfect details of those underlying processes. This
idea needs more fleshing out, but it seems to be an interesting
perspective to me.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="wordpress_migration"></category></entry><entry><title>On Being Wrong</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2012/Mar/20/on-being-wrong/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-03-20T00:38:00-04:00</published><updated>2012-03-20T00:38:00-04:00</updated><author><name>brianblais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2012-03-20:/posts/2012/Mar/20/on-being-wrong/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I tell my students that I supremely hope that they have the experience

of one of their cherished ideas shown to be wrong. I was recently
confronted with a perception mistake on my part which I found to be
pretty interesting, even if the consequences are pretty mundane. So, I'm
learning how to swim, and I take lessons at the local YMCA. I have
recently started practicing a little at the university pool. When I
first started swimming at the university pool I noticed that it was
significantly longer than the one at the YMCA…at least that is what I
thought. I had told a number of people this, particularly how much
longer it looked and how much longer it felt swimming to the other side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was told this past weekend that they are the same length, which I
totally didn't believe. The swim instructor insisted that they are both
25 yards long, and that she has swim meets in both pools. Still
skeptical, I did some digging. The university pool seemed, to me, to be
1.5 to 2 times longer! No way I could make a mistake of that magnitude!
It felt much longer! It took longer to swim across!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*sigh*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are the same length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I find very interesting is how certain I was of a completely
physical measurement, that later turned out to be incorrect. There is
something about how the pool had very few people at the university or
had glass on each end, compared to the crowded YMCA pool which is walled
in by cinderblock, combined with my inexperience with swimming which
probably gives rise to the illusion. Or perhaps the fact that the YMCA
pool is narrower adds to the illusion. Whatever it is, it was a
completely obvious, visceral estimate of the length of an object that
turned out to be completely wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It reminds me of the sort of arguments that people make like "Air Force
pilots will not make mistakes in observing things in the sky, which
bolsters the UFO claim" or "Doctors will not make mistakes in observing
medical effects, which bolsters this miracle claim." Arguments from
authority fail because authorities can be mistaken, even on basic
things.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="wordpress_migration"></category></entry><entry><title>Evolution and Rationality</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2012/Mar/06/evolution-and-rationality/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-03-06T01:23:00-05:00</published><updated>2012-03-06T01:23:00-05:00</updated><author><name>brianblais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2012-03-06:/posts/2012/Mar/06/evolution-and-rationality/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.premierradio.org.uk/listen/ondemand.aspx?mediaid={1002DC66-006D-420D-B690-47B876182579}"&gt;Stephen Law vs Alvin Plantinga on the Unbelievable podcast&lt;/a&gt; on the

&lt;p&gt;Basic argument, from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_argument_against_naturalism"&gt;Wikipedia on Evolutionary argument against
naturalism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't read the responses, so that my response will be fresh and
untainted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plantinga defined:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;N as naturalism, which he defined as "the idea that there is no
    such person as God or anything like God; we might think of it as
    high-octane atheism or perhaps atheism-plus."[12]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;E as the belief that human beings have evolved in conformity with
    current evolutionary theory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;R as the proposition that our faculties are "reliable", where,
    roughly, a cognitive faculty is "reliable" if the great bulk of
    its deliverances are true. He specifically cited the example of a
    thermometer stuck at 72 °F (22 °C) degrees placed in an
    environment which happened to be at 72 °F as an example of
    something that is not "reliable" in this sense[9]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and suggested that the conditional probability of R given N and E, or
P(R|N&amp;amp;E), is low or inscrutable.[19]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plantinga's argument began with the observation that our beliefs can
only have evolutionary consequences if they affect behaviour. To put
this another way, natural selection does not directly select for true
beliefs, but rather for advantageous behaviours. Plantinga
distinguished the various theories of mind-body interaction into four
jointly exhaustive categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;epiphenomenalism, where behaviour is not caused by beliefs. "if
    this way of thinking is right, beliefs would be invisible to
    evolution" so P(R/N&amp;amp;E) would be low or inscrutable[20]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Semantic epiphenomenalism, where beliefs have a causative link to
    behaviour but not by virtue of their semantic content. Under this
    theory, a belief would be some form of long-term neuronal
    event.[21] However, on this view P(R|N&amp;amp;E) would be low because the
    semantic content of beliefs would be invisible to natural
    selection, and it is semantic content that determines truth-value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beliefs are causally efficacious with respect to behaviour, but
    maladaptive, in which case P(R|N&amp;amp;E) would be low, as R would be
    selected against.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beliefs are causally efficacious with respect to behaviour and
    also adaptive, but they may still be false. Since behaviour is
    caused by both belief and desire, and desire can lead to false
    belief, natural selection would have no reason for selecting true
    but non-adaptive beliefs over false but adaptive beliefs. Thus
    P(R|N&amp;amp;E) in this case would also be low.[22] Plantinga pointed out
    that innumerable belief-desire pairs could account for a given
    behaviour; for example, that of a prehistoric hominid fleeing a
    tiger:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Paul very much likes the idea of being eaten, but when he sees
a tiger, always runs off looking for a better prospect, because he
thinks it unlikely the tiger he sees will eat him. This will get his
body parts in the right place so far as survival is concerned, without
involving much by way of true belief. ... Or perhaps he thinks the
tiger is a large, friendly, cuddly pussycat and wants to pet it; but
he also believes that the best way to pet it is to run away from it.
... Clearly there are any number of belief-cum-desire systems that
equally fit a given bit of behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, Plantinga argued, the probability that our minds are reliable
under a conjunction of philosophical naturalism and naturalistic
evolution is low or inscrutable. Therefore, to assert that
naturalistic evolution is true also asserts that one has a low or
unknown probability of being right. This, Plantinga argued,
epistemically defeats the belief that naturalistic evolution is true
and that ascribing truth to naturalism and evolution is internally
dubious or inconsistent.[24]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are certainly several things in this argument that need to be
thought out. Point (1) is certainly true: any beliefs that do not affect
behavior &lt;em&gt;in any way&lt;/em&gt; would be invisible to evolution. I doubt there are
many beliefs in this category. Even something vague, like the belief in
a deist god, would at some point affect behavior in some way. Point (3)
is also uncontroversial. Point (2) I'm not sure I understand entirely,
so I'll focus on point (4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two parts - "behaviour is caused by both belief and desire,"
and "innumerable belief-desire pairs could account for a given
behaviour" with the example of running from tigers because of various
false beliefs. The final piece of this, however, is the limited
resources of the brain. Our brain takes many computational short-cuts,
because of efficiency and limited resources. If you have a number of
different belief/desire pairs that lead to behavior, the brain will
settle on those belief/desire pairs that generalize to the largest
number of things. This will certainly be in cases where the result is
closer to reality than not. We run away not only from tigers, but also
bears, snakes, and spiders. The desire to pet or the mistaken belief
that running away is the best way to get towards an animal would not
generalize quite so well to these other creatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plantinga uses this argument from rationality to bolster his theism - if
rationality is unlikely given naturalism and evolution, then theism is
more likely. However, he fails to notice that rationality isn't truly
the norm. Yes, we can make some astounding feats of rationality as a
collection, but it takes serious work to overcome the natural biases,
and failures of reasoning inherent in the human condition. The cognitive
short-cuts leads us to make many errors of observation, deduction, and
induction. He also fails to point out the many beliefs that people have
that are irrational but have a benefit, or the beliefs that people have
which are irrational and have no effect and thus can get carried along
without being selected against. In fact, the situation is very much like
what you'd expect from evolution - some wrong beliefs with adaptive
benefits, some wrong beliefs with no penalty, some correct beliefs by
accident, etc… Finally, even if our beliefs were 90% wrong, we'd still
be able to trust rationality &lt;em&gt;as a collection&lt;/em&gt; - which is exactly what
science does. It forces fallible people to not believe things until it
can be replicated, it downplays anecdotal evidence, arguments from
authority, and recognizes the cognitive failures of humans in order to
overcome them.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="wordpress_migration"></category></entry><entry><title>What is good in religion</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2012/Mar/05/what-is-good-in-religion/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-03-05T13:53:00-05:00</published><updated>2012-03-05T13:53:00-05:00</updated><author><name>brianblais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2012-03-05:/posts/2012/Mar/05/what-is-good-in-religion/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was asked recently if I thought there was anything good about

religion. I felt it was an important enough question to give it a fair
amount of thought. Coincidentally, I listened to a podcast that dealt
with some of these issues. The podcast is called &lt;a href="http://www.premier.org.uk/unbelievable"&gt;Unbelievable&lt;/a&gt;, and
the particular episode is called &lt;a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/unbelievable/id267142101#"&gt;Should atheists be more religious?
Alain de Botton and James Orr&lt;/a&gt;. I like this podcast in general,
because they pit the religious against the non-religious in an informal
discussion for about an hour and a half. This particular episode raised
the issue of religions' usefulness, and what can be borrowed by
atheists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the points was the contrast between the Christian view of
humanity and the view of humanity as is often suggested by secularists.
In the Christian view, humans are essentially fallen creatures, are
naturally evil and need the grace of God to save them from this. The
main secular view, which seemingly has been espoused since around the
1960s, asserts that people are naturally good and that culture is the
dominant force which turns them bad, and further that through rational
analysis one can overcome this cultural influence as science transcends
all cultural barriers. This just doesn't gel with basic observations, I
feel, and thus there is a benefit to the Christian view as a metaphor.
If you've ever been to a daycare, it is quite obvious that children are
naturally bad, or at least have more bad than good, and need to be saved
from this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we don't need to believe in a magic garden and a talking snake, or
assert that this observation of humanity has as a consequence that the
Earth is 6000 years old, in order to draw value from it. In the same way
that we draw value from Shakespeare, we can draw some value from the
Genesis story (although I think there have to be better stories, which
place women in a more favorable light!). Honestly, I think one can make
a reasonable argument from evolution that reflects the ``fallen
being'' idea. Essentially, we have a balance between selfish desires
(clearly advantageous) and social desires (also advantageous, in social
animals). A proper balance needs to be made, and there is a spectrum of
selfish impulses, and the desire to suppress them in various ways. I
think some of the rituals of religion help to remind us of this. Even
gathering as a group on Sundays is an example of this - one is more
likely to reflect on helping others when one is regularly together in a
group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is true that there are things of benefit which, in the past, have
only been the purview of religions. Getting together regularly,
meditative rituals, ritual individual sacrifice (not human or animal
sacrifice! think Lent here...), and traditions of giving (think
Christmas) are examples of this sort of thing. Notice, however, that
none of these &lt;em&gt;requires&lt;/em&gt; the inclusion of superstitious claims, or
claims about the cosmos or our role in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the benefits, there are a number of costs associated with
these same examples that get dragged along with the religion. The blind
following of authorities, the dogmatic adherence to invisible
``realities'', and the divisive nature of the practices are a few of
these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that there are ways of getting the benefits with minimizing
the costs. I also believe that the &lt;em&gt;truth&lt;/em&gt; of claims is intricately
related to their &lt;em&gt;usefulness&lt;/em&gt;. What I mean is if you have a system of
belief that does not reflect reality, then reality has a habit of making
itself known, even if it might take a while. Finally, I think there is a
lot to learn about what is beneficial to human mental well-being and
societal well-being, and that some of these benefits currently are most
clearly demonstrated in a religious context. I don't think that they
need to be exclusively achieved in a religious context.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="wordpress_migration"></category></entry><entry><title>Best quote in a while about global warming...</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2012/Jan/27/best-quote-in-a-while-about-global-warming/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-01-27T18:48:00-05:00</published><updated>2012-01-27T18:48:00-05:00</updated><author><name>brianblais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2012-01-27:/posts/2012/Jan/27/best-quote-in-a-while-about-global-warming/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the article &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204301404577171531838421366.html"&gt;Sixteen Concerned Scientists: No Need to Panic About

&lt;a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/774/a_history_of_bayes_theorem/"&gt;found here&lt;/a&gt;. The funny thing is that, upon looking into Bayesian
analysis, it all seemed so obvious to me...not trivial, but obvious.
It's just a mathematical way of writing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial Belief + New Data -&amp;gt; Improved Belief&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a straightforward application of probability theory, has many
intuitive examples, and the only competition (so-called orthodox or
frequentist stats) can be shown to have serious, obvious flaws. Although
in some fields Bayesian analysis is the standard, introductory classes
in statistics are still dominated by the frequentist culture. This is an
example of a practical working solution being upstaged by something
else, something inferior. I often wonder, why isn't everyone a Bayesian?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, then we come to hiccups. One thing about hiccups is that it is
likely to be a behavior &lt;a href="http://richarddawkins.net/articles/2125"&gt;inherited by our fish ancestors&lt;/a&gt;! How cool is
that? Anyway, you ask 10 people and they will give you 10 different
solutions to getting rid of hiccups. Usually this involves imbibing a
large quantity of liquid, or doing something either annoying or
uncomfortable. When I was young, my mother taught be that if you drink a
small amount (no more than 2 swallows) of a carbonated beverage it gets
rid of the hiccups...instantly. It has worked every time I've tried, but
I don't have carbonated beverages at home much, and when I do I don't
want to waste a whole can for 2 or 3 swallows. Then, one of our
children's preschool teachers taught me this one, which has worked every
time, and in every person I've told it to. I have yet to see a counter
example. It's bizarrely simple, and I wonder how it works. Here are the
steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;take a sip of water&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;say, out loud, the word "one"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;take another sip&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;say, out loud, the word "two"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time you're at 9, they're gone. You may not even need to get up
to nine, but still, 9 small sips of water is not bad. This is a
practical solution, which seems to have no counter example, and is
superior to every other solution I've found...just like Bayesian
analysis!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, perhaps the link is a little weak, but it's worth considering. Are
there other examples of clearly superior practices that just aren't the
ones that are known?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="wordpress_migration"></category></entry><entry><title>Santa and other delusions</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2012/Jan/04/santa-and-other-delusions/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-01-04T10:58:00-05:00</published><updated>2012-01-04T10:58:00-05:00</updated><author><name>brianblais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2012-01-04:/posts/2012/Jan/04/santa-and-other-delusions/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Given how I seem to support no delusions, how can I justify perpetuating

the myth of Santa Claus with my kids (oldest nearing 10)? First, I have
to say I am not entirely convinced it is a good idea. I'd be open to
evidence (not just opinion!) of the harm, but I haven't actually seen
any. Further, there seems to be a need for fantasy play with children
below a certain age (somewhere around 10). I am not sure of the
developmental role, but the behavior (even without adult help) is
ubiquitous. Finally, it is fun and interesting. Here's a little sample
story that happened this year, that made me understand that I have no
idea how kids are actually perceiving the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had gotten an &lt;a href="http://www.elfontheshelf.com/AboutUs/TheTradition.aspx"&gt;Elf-on-the-Shelf&lt;/a&gt; this year for the first time. Our
kids had seen them before, at school and at friends houses, so they were
familiar with the rules: no touching the elf (or he loses his powers);
the elf can't touch the ground at all; you can talk to him all you want
(but he won't talk back to you); he goes off each night, and returns in
a new place in the house where you need to find him. Now, one morning we
hadn't secured our little elf too well...he was sitting on a stuffed
Santa, hanging on a door. At one point the kids started shouting because
the Elf was leaning way over about to fall. After a little bit of
concern, all the kids had something in another room to do, and I managed
to adjust him back up, secure him, and go into another room myself. When
they returned, they were all abuzz with how he had leaned down all by
himself, and gotten up all by himself, etc... I suggested perhaps the
Santa had helped him up. Very seriously, they looked at me and said
"Dad, that's just a stuffed Santa".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I realize that people see agency in non-living things, but it was
amazing to see the same done on such a selective basis. Now sure what it
means, except that I have no idea how they perceive the world.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="wordpress_migration"></category></entry><entry><title>Einstein and the Motives of Scientists</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2011/Dec/27/einstein-and-the-motives-of-scientists/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-12-27T20:52:00-05:00</published><updated>2011-12-27T20:52:00-05:00</updated><author><name>brianblais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2011-12-27:/posts/2011/Dec/27/einstein-and-the-motives-of-scientists/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just got a [shout out from The Legal Watchdog, Michael Cicchini][] for

a post I did on [dark matter and the speed of light][]. His response to
my criticism of his original posts [here][] and [here][1] shows that he
missed the point of my criticism. I'll grant him that I may have come
off as "condescending", and that my "stick to law" comment could be
interpreted as more than the strategically exaggerated tone used in a
blog. So what about his original post and his reply do I find
problematic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his reply Mr Cicchini directs me to address the specific issues with
the authors, and in his original post he says that he's "only begun
exploring the relevant issues", and that he's "delving into matters that
are way over [his] head". Then, he makes claims like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we create the concept of dark matter "to allow us to cling to
    Einstein's theory of general relativity"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"physicists seem to try and substantiate, rather than question, his
    [Einstein's] work."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;physicists should "abandon Einstein's quest of unifying the quantum
    with the cosmic"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is at least twofold:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Mr Cicchini &lt;em&gt;claims&lt;/em&gt; to be in over his head, he &lt;em&gt;writes&lt;/em&gt; as
    if he is an authority, or that he understands the authorities when
    in reality he doesn't&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is making many claims about &lt;em&gt;motive&lt;/em&gt; with no evidence whatsoever&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-motives"&gt;The Motives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are both mixed up with a profound lack of understanding of the
methods of science. Let's put it this way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it true that physicists will first look for ways in which the
    anomalous mass measurements of galaxies and the current best theory
    of gravity, Einstein's general theory of relativity (GR), can be
    made to be consistent even if it means proposing a
    never-before-observed quantity "dark matter"? Yes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this imply that they are are unwilling to question GR, in
    deference to Einstein or for some other reason? No!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you had a theory that has yet to have an exception, in over 100
years, and has made predictions accurate to many &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; decimal points,
and has been shown to predict other unforeseen objects (such as black
holes), then it is entirely rational to proceed as the cosmologists
have. It is not dogmatic to assert your confidence in something that has
a dedicated track record. It is also never the case in science that we
"start from scratch" when we have an anomalous observation...we only
abandon a theory when we have something better in its place...and we
don't in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the "dark matter" problem is not just a problem for
100-year-old-Einstein's theory but for 300-year-old-Newton's theory! So,
if your advice is for scientists to "start from scratch", then you're
essentially suggesting that we ignore almost everything we've learned in
physics for the past 300 years. I have a big problem with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-science"&gt;The Science&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the motive is wrong, but is the science correct? I'd say, "no" to
that as well. In the second post, there is a reference to the latest
faster than light measurements. Mr Cicchini directs me to writer [Brian
Vastag][] concerning the experiment. In that article, there is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&gt; The physicist, Dario Auterio, made no sweeping claims.
&gt;
&gt; He did not try to explain what the results might mean for the laws of
&gt; physics, let alone the broader world.
&gt;
&gt; After an hour of technical talk, he simply said, "Therefore, we
&gt; present to you today this discrepancy, this anomaly."

Notice how the *physicists in this experiment* are not making the claims
that Mr Cicchini is making, and they show a humility that is the
hallmark of true science. Sure, scientists will put down clearly wrong
ideas with a harshness that is not common in regular speech. But when
they are dealing with events beyond their understanding the humility
exhibited by scientists is far greater than in any other human endeavor.
Even Christopher Hitchens, who was not known for his humility, would
[demonstrate it][] whenever he dealt with science topics on the
outskirts of his understanding.

On the authorities Mr Cicchini chooses to represent his case, we have
the following problems:

-   Brian Vastag is a science writer, and makes the correct claim that,
    *if true*, the faster-than-light measurements *could possibly*
    overturn relativity. It could also be that *if true*, the
    measurements would cause only a small modification of relativity, as
    I outlined in the [previous post][dark matter and the speed of
    light]. It could also be the case that the experiments, or the
    analysis, are wrong in some way. That's where my money is. Is that
    dogmatic? No! It is based on the many preliminary violations of
    relativity over the last century that were shown to be erroneous
    either in measurement or in analysis. Could I be wrong? Of course!
    And that would be pretty cool. But I'm not going to be convinced
    until the dust settles for a while. Extraordinary claims require
    extraordinary evidence.

-   Lee Smolin, who wrote a book [The Trouble With Physics: The Rise of
    String Theory, The Fall of a Science, and What Comes Next][]. I have
    not read this book, but his claims about string theory (from the
    quotes) don't seem too bad...he essentially is pointing out that
    string theory is currently lacking any predictions which differ from
    quantum chromodynamics and general relativity. Mr Cicchini quotes
    Smolin "The dark matter hypothesis is preferred mostly because the
    only other possibility - that we are wrong about Newton's laws, and
    by extension general relativity - is too scary to contemplate." I
    would guess that this is exaggerated language, referring to the fact
    that any theory to replace Newton's laws and Einstein's theory would
    be formidable indeed! It does not, however, immediately imply a
    dogmatic "clinging" to Einstein's theory, although I'll admit I need
    to read the book to tell for sure.

-   Peter Lynds is the third reference from Mr Cicchini. After noting
    the reference, I read Lynds' paper, ["Time and Classical and Quantum
    Mechanics: Indeterminacy vs. Discontinuity"][]. First of all, I
    wasn't impressed. It certainly lacks the clarity of [Einstein's 1905
    paper][], to which it has been compared. It also makes no
    predictions, as far as I can tell, and certainly hasn't moved more
    than a small minority of physicists to even consider it. Is this
    because of a dogmatic loyalty to Einstein? Not at all. It is due to
    the usual, and rational, mode of scientific discourse in which new
    ideas purporting to replace established theories need to demonstrate
    that they are in fact superior to those theories with actual
    verifiable predictions before they are considered seriously.

Further, Mr Cicchini's advice to "abandon Einstein's quest of unifying
the quantum with the cosmic" is ill-informed. He continues that "there
is no reason to believe that things on a tiny, subatomic scale would
obey the same laws as things on a grand, universal scale." Let's put it
this way: we have two amazing approximate theories: quantum
chromodynamics and general relativity. Each working in their own domains
(the really small and the really big, respectively). They look *nothing*
like each other. One is probabilistic and discrete while the other is
deterministic and continuous. In some limiting cases, it can be shown
that medium-sized events (i.e. events on the scale of humans up to
planets) can be seen as limiting case of quantum events. In addition,
relativity can be shown to work for gravitational effects on
medium-sized objects (i.e. the size of planets). What we don't have is a
good, unified, set of ideas that link the two domains well.
Historically, there is a strong precedent for expecting there to be
unifying set of laws. The development of thermodynamics and the
connection to atomic theory is one example, the development of
electrodynamics and its connection to the microscopic effects of
currents and magnets is another. So there is *every reason* to expect
that there is a unifying principle. To say "give up, you'll never find
it" is reminiscent of people saying the same thing for the search for
extraterrestrial life, given that we've never found any.

### Silencing the Layperson

Finally, I want to address the charge that I am trying to silence
laypeople who speak about science, and that this is bad for science. Mr
Cicchini writes:

&lt;p&gt;
&gt; And shutting laypeople out of science, or urging them "not to speak
&gt; about physics"-which, conveniently, precludes any external
&gt; challenges-causes science to take on an even greater dogmatic quality,
&gt; which science cannot afford.
&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

For me, this has nothing to do with "laypeople" (a phrase I associate
more with non-clergy as opposed to non-academic), but with people
speaking confidently when their confidence is completely unwarranted. I
don't believe you need a PhD to speak about science in a productive way,
but you do have to do your homework. The motive claims described above
demonstrate a clear ignorance of the true motivations of scientists. If
I were trying to confidently tell lawyers what to do or to impugn their
motives, I'd be out of line because I know very little about law...and
someone would be absolutely correct to call me out on that. Scientists
face this all the time, and thus their tone is almost always very
conservative, especially when speaking with other scientists. Just look
at the language of the scientists doing the faster-than-light
experiments. This doesn't mean that scientists are above this kind of
misplaced confidence...I could still list many examples of scientists
speaking out of their area of expertise, but it is considered a real
liability in science.

So, the bottom line is that where Mr Cicchini sees a conspiracy, the
facts support a rational scientific discourse. Where Mr Cicchini sees an
elite academic silencing the criticism by a layperson, the reality is
that it is rational to critique *anyone* speaking confidently of things
they cannot be confident of. Where Mr Cicchini sees a dogmatic,
unswerving, scientific establishment, the facts support the confidence
scientists have in centuries old models of the universe that have
withstood the hammer blows of criticism during those centuries, all
without buckling. It doesn't mean that the new ideas are necessarily
*wrong*, but it does mean that we are a lot less confident of them *for
good reason*.

Discoveries"][] where there are quotes from the Bible that supposedly
pre-dated the actual scientific discoveries. It is interesting for the
number of science errors, and also the failure of any kind of critical
scientific thinking. I will leave it as an exercise for the reader to
determine the worst occurrences of these, but I do want to point out two
main issues that I see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="metaphorical-or-literal"&gt;Metaphorical or Literal?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We start with this claim from the page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&gt; Today we take the shape of the earth for granted, but remember that
&gt; primitive man had no way to actually know that the earth is spherical.
&gt; In fact, without access to exploration and distant observation, the
&gt; world most certainly seemed flat, and that is exactly how primitive
&gt; men and cultures described it. But the Bible describes it differently:
&gt;
&gt; &lt;p&gt;
&gt; &gt; *Isaiah 40:22* He sits enthroned above the circle of the earth, and
&gt; &gt; its people are like grasshoppers. He stretches out the heavens like
&gt; &gt; a canopy, and spreads them out like a tent to live in.
&gt; &gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &lt;p&gt;
&gt; &gt; *Proverbs 8:27* When He prepared the heavens, I was there: when He
&gt; &gt; set a compass upon the face of the depth
&gt; &gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&gt;
&gt; [...]But even before this explorative discovery, the round earth was
&gt; recorded in the Judeo-Christian Bible!

[Earlier, on a different page,][] the following issue is raised:

&lt;p&gt;
&gt; &gt; *Isaiah 11:12* He will raise a banner for the nations and gather the
&gt; &gt; exiles of Israel; he will assemble the scattered people of Judah
&gt; &gt; from the four quarters of the earth.
&gt; &gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Does this scripture teach that the earth is actually flat? That's what
&gt; critics would have you believe. But this is simply a cultural
&gt; expression (and one that we still use today), and it has little to say
&gt; about the truth of the shape of the earth.

A similar argument holds for the "days" used in Genesis not being
literal, 24-hour, days but rather epochs spanning billions of years. The
bottom line is:

**If it contradicts science, then it is metaphor. If it is consistent
with science, then it is prescient.**

Or, in other words,

**Heads I win. Tails you lose.**

Prediction versus Postdiction
-----------------------------

The other example I want to look at is one that I hadn't heard before
(I've omitted a fair amount of explanatory text, to try to distill it
down to the essentials...go read the original if you feel I've done a
disservice to the points):

&lt;p&gt;
&gt; If you've ever read the story of Job in the Bible, [...] he eventually
&gt; accused the Lord of being unjust. God didn't answer Job's accusation
&gt; directly. Instead, He began to ask Job a series of questions and one
&gt; of these questions demonstrates perhaps the most amazing scientific
&gt; truth in all of scripture:
&gt;
&gt; &lt;p&gt;
&gt; &gt; *Job 38:31-32* Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or
&gt; &gt; loose the bands of Orion? Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his
&gt; &gt; season? or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons?
&gt; &gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Now God makes a statement about three stellar constellations [...].
&gt; First let's take a look at what God says about Orion: 'Canst thou . .
&gt; . loose the bands of Orion?' [...] Today, this band consists of an
&gt; almost perfectly straight line of second-magnitude stars that are
&gt; equally spaced and very beautiful. In the course of time, however, the
&gt; two right-hand stars, Mintaka and Alnilam, will approach each other
&gt; and form a naked-eye double; but the third, Alnitak, will drift away
&gt; eastward so that the band will no longer exist. [...] As time passes,
&gt; this band of stars will indeed be loosened, just as God told Job.
&gt;
&gt; But now let's take a look at the Pleiades Constellation. Look at what
&gt; God says: 'Canst thou bind the sweet influence of the Pleiades . . .
&gt; ?' [...] astronomers have identified 250 stars as actual members of
&gt; this group, all sharing a common motion and drifting through space in
&gt; the same direction. [...] Sounds a lot like what God described in the
&gt; Book of Job! "Hey Job, can you bind Pleiades together? I did!"
&gt;
&gt; Finally, let's take a look at Arcturus. Remember what God said about
&gt; this constellation: 'Canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons?' [...]
&gt; Arcturus may look like it is fixed in the sky, but Garrett P. Serviss
&gt; wrote that [...] it is a runaway star whose speed of flight is about
&gt; 257 miles per second. [...]Arcturus is a runaway. [...]
&gt;
&gt; These scientific facts recorded in the book of Job concerning the
&gt; Pleiades, Orion and Arcturus constellations anticipated scientific
&gt; discovery by nearly 3,000 years. Scientists only discovered these
&gt; startling facts in the Twentieth Century, yet they were recorded in
&gt; the book of Job nearly 3000 years ago. Twentieth Century science has
&gt; proven God's Word, the Bible, is true.

### What if it is the opposite?

One of the ways that you can figure out the issues with claims like this
is to play the hypothetical game of "what if the opposite occurred?".
What would happen to the prescient nature of the quotation? So, say that
Pleiades is flying apart, the belt of Orion is fixed, and Arcturus is a
star with a more traditional path. What would the quotation mean? All
you have to do is reinterpret the *tone* of God's statement, for example
God to Job: "Pleiades is flying apart, could you, Job, bring it
together?" All of the rest of the argument then holds together.

Bottom line:

**If your statement is consistent with one result, *and its opposite*,
then it is meaningless.**

But it's worse than that...

### What if it is both?

Well, you might claim that the critical thing in the statement which
makes it more believable is that God is claiming one effect for Pleiades
and the opposite effect for Orion (and a pretty neutral effect for
Arcturus). Even if this were flipped, it would still have that contrast.
Now, what happens if, for some reason, one could argue that Pleiades was
both bound and flying apart, or that the bands of Orion are both
loosening and tightening? Pretty much, any statement about them could be
made to seem "prescient". That's the nature of a post-diction. It is
also the reason why pre-dictions are so hard, and why activities like
science that make good pre-dictions regularly have the authoritative
status that everyone else craves.

Pleiades is a young star cluster so, it is a bound system. However, over
the course of a couple of orbits around the galaxy, the galactic tidal
forces will pull the cluster apart. The Sun was born in such a cluster
(as all stars are), and her siblings are far flung by now. So it is easy
to see that the Pleiades is currently bound, but not permanently bound.
The stars in Orion are moving in various directions. By their own
admission, these authors point out that two of the stars are moving
closer to each other (in the sky, not in reality) and the other moving
away. Thus, part of the belt is tightening.

Bottom line:

**If your statement is consistent with *any* result, then it is
content-free.**

or in other words,

**Shoot first, and call whatever you hit the target.**

Entropy
-------

Sorry, I couldn't help but include this example. These Bible quotes are
supposedly prescient of the development of the Second Law of
Thermodynamics:

&lt;p&gt;
&gt; *Psalm 102:22-26* In the beginning you laid the foundations of the
&gt; earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands. They will perish,
&gt; but you remain; they will all wear out like a garment. Like clothing
&gt; you will change them and they will be discarded
&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&gt; *Hebrews 1:10-11* In the beginning, O Lord, you laid the foundations
&gt; of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands. They will
&gt; perish, but you remain; they will all wear out like a garment.
&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Enough said.

simply closed to the possibility of a transcendent being, or of
miracles, or of the supernatural in general. If you closed to these
concepts from the beginning, then no amount of evidence will sway you. I
was thinking about this, and what my perspective is, and I came up with
a few thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first reaction is that I don't know what the terms mean. For example,
someone says that I am closed to the idea of a "trogglet". What does it
mean? I am not closed, nor open, to the idea of a "trogglet" simply
because it is not defined. Ok, so define it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definition of a transcendent being:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transcendence refers to the aspect of God's nature which is wholly
independent of (and removed from) the physical universe.
[&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendence_(religion)"&gt;wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;]
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;definition of supernatural:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The supernatural is that which is not subject to the laws of
nature, or more figuratively, that which is said to exist above
and beyond nature. [&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernatural"&gt;wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;]
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;definition of miracle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A miracle often denotes an event attributed to divine
intervention. Alternatively, it may be an event attributed to a
miracle worker, saint, or religious leader. A miracle is sometimes
thought of as a perceptible interruption of the laws of nature.
Others suggest that a god may work with the laws of nature to
perform what people perceive as miracles.&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernatural"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; Theologians say that,
with divine providence, God regularly works through created nature
yet is free to work without, above, or against it as well.&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;
[[wikipedia][2]]
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would content that these definitions aren't particularly specific, but
let's raise another issue: how would you know that something
supernatural exists, or a supernatural event has happened? Since we can
only be aware of physical effects, we have three choices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;supernatural events occur only supernaturally (i.e. no impact on
    physical reality)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;supernatural events have some impact on physical reality and the
    impact works &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; physical law&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;supernatural events have some impact on physical reality and the
    impact goes beyond physical law&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to claim choice 1, then there is no difference between a
supernatural event and no event at all (i.e. it is content-free). If you
want to claim choice 2, then there is no way (even in principle!) to
tell whether the cause is supernatural, and thus is also content-free.
That leaves the final choices, which perhaps is testable (in theory) but
you then must rule out &lt;em&gt;any and all possible natural interpretations of
those events&lt;/em&gt;. Essentially it boils down to a God-of-the-Gaps arguments,
because you're simply left with "I can't think of any way that this
event could have happened naturally".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interesting thing about this is not that we have come to the
conclusion that the existence of supernatural events is either
content-free or God-of-the-Gaps, but that the purported "Gaps" that are
often claimed are so trivial, and already filled, that it undermines the
entire endeavor. Design in biology is solved by evolution, regardless of
the protestations of the creationists. The origin of the universe is
systematically being solved by the cosmologists, with no help from the
theists. I'd love to see something that really rises to the level of a
miracle, like the 10 commandments etched in Pluto or something. Although
technically a God-of-the-Gaps argument, it would be very interesting
indeed! However, we are given no such evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is reminiscent of the UFO enthusiasts. We'd love to see actual
objects from aliens, or actual communication from aliens, or convincing
video. Instead, we're given bad evidence after bad evidence.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="wordpress_migration"></category></entry><entry><title>Presuppositionalism vs evidentialism</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2011/Dec/19/presuppositionalism-vs-evidentialism/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-12-19T16:29:00-05:00</published><updated>2011-12-19T16:29:00-05:00</updated><author><name>brianblais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2011-12-19:/posts/2011/Dec/19/presuppositionalism-vs-evidentialism/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;These two terms that I had never heard before came up when listening to

and &lt;a href="http://www.str.org/podcast/weekly/rss.xml"&gt;Stand to Reason&lt;/a&gt;). There seems to be some split between Christian
apologists on these two approaches to apology. What is interesting is
that the normal course of science uses both, so there really shouldn't
be any split for any rational approach to justification of the ideas.
Evidentialists argue for the exists of the Christian God through
outlining of the evidence of the Christian God, and then follow the
logical arguments that come from that. Presuppositionalists seem to
assume the existence of the Christian God, but then try demonstrate that
the world only makes sense if you do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, they are "X is true and here is the evidence or logical
argument for X" and "if we assume X, then W, Y, and Z that we observe
make sense...otherwise W, Y, and Z do not make sense". Both of these are
done in science all the time. Take, Newton's law of gravitation for
example. When he proposed the form of the gravitational force, &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;F&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;∼&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mn&gt;1&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mi mathvariant="normal"&gt;/&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;msup&gt;&lt;mi&gt;r&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mn&gt;2&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/msup&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex"&gt;

form...that was first done only &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavendish_experiment"&gt;100 years later by Cavendish&lt;/a&gt;. What
he did is say was "&lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; the form of the force is &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;F&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;∼&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mn&gt;1&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mi mathvariant="normal"&gt;/&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;msup&gt;&lt;mi&gt;r&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mn&gt;2&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/msup&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex"&gt;

planets, the tides, the falling of objects near the surface of the
Earth, etc...)". In a way, this is a presuppositionalist argument: if we
take X to be true, then our observations of W, Y, and Z make sense. This
type of argument is considered evidence in science, and is done all the
time. Really, the two ways that scientific theories can be justified
are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;directly test the assumptions of the theory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;spin out the consequences, and compare with observation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former is, what the apologists would call, evidentialist while the
latter is presuppositionalist. In a fit of irony, I have heard many
so-called refutations of atheists on the topic of morality of the form
"atheists claim there is no objective morality, so they can't even state
that the actions of the God in the Old Testament are evil". However, all
these atheists are doing are using a preuppositionalist argument: "If we
assume that God is good, and that the 'good' is defined by the
statements of Jesus and the ten commandments, then we can demonstrate
that the other acts of God in the Bible are evil."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I just like to lump both terms into "rational argument" and
leave it at that. They do little to shed light on the issues, and to me
they are a distinction without a difference.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="wordpress_migration"></category></entry><entry><title>More fine tuning...NOT</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2011/Dec/15/more-fine-tuning-not/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-12-15T17:34:00-05:00</published><updated>2011-12-15T17:34:00-05:00</updated><author><name>brianblais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2011-12-15:/posts/2011/Dec/15/more-fine-tuning-not/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the so-called fine-tuned parameters in our solar system

list of supposed fine tunings, Hugh Ross mentions that &lt;a href="//"&gt;we even need a
big moon to have life on this planet.&lt;/a&gt; Much of the fine tuning
argument is a thinly veiled God-of-the-Gaps argument: we can't explain
it, therefore God must have done it.  One of the things that happens to
such arguments is that people finally explain it.  So, in that vein, we
have the following idea that &lt;a href="//"&gt;we may not need such a large moon after
all&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Darren Williams of Pennsylvania State University, “Large
moons are not required for a stable tilt and climate. In some
circumstances, large moons can even be detrimental, depending on the
arrangement of planets in a given system. Every system is going to be
different.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one example of lack of imagination leading to erroneous
arguments.  The problem is not the mistake itself, it's that once you
attribute a theological "solution" to your problem, then you cease to
look for the truth.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="wordpress_migration"></category></entry><entry><title>Things science can't explain</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2011/Dec/09/things-science-cant-explain/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-12-09T12:08:00-05:00</published><updated>2011-12-09T12:08:00-05:00</updated><author><name>brianblais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2011-12-09:/posts/2011/Dec/09/things-science-cant-explain/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;During a &lt;a href="http://richarddawkins.net/audio/721-1986-oxford-union-debate"&gt;debate on evolution and design&lt;/a&gt;, Professor Edgar Andrews

from Queen Mary College London stated that there were four things that
science could never explain. He pointed out that these were not simply
gaps, that could possibly be explained in the future, but were
&lt;em&gt;logically impossible for science to explain&lt;/em&gt;. Here they are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science can't explain ultimate origins&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If the laws that control the universe started with the universe,
then they could not have caused the universe. If not, then the
laws would have to have been "written" before the universe.
Science cannot explain how those laws exist, prior to the
universe."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science can't justify itself&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Science must be silent on why natural laws take the form that
they do. For example, why is the gravitational law of the form
&lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;F&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;∼&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mn&gt;1&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mi mathvariant="normal"&gt;/&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;msup&gt;&lt;mi&gt;r&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mn&gt;2&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/msup&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex"&gt;F \sim 1/r^2&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.13889em;"&gt;F&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mrel"&gt;∼&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut" style="height:1.0641em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;1/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.02778em;"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist" style="height:0.8141em;"&gt;&lt;span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mtight"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and not some other form, like inverse
cube? It is precisely, exactly, and eternally an inverse square.
Why should that be? Science can never give an answer, because it
is only descriptive, not pre-scriptive of nature.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science can't explain the origin of life&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Life depends on code, and information. It is impossible for
information to be generated from random chemical combination, or
random chance events"
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science can't explain the phenomenon of mind&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is something different about man, a biological uniqueness.
This includes the capacity of self knowledge, thought, reason, and
intelligence. Science is unable to account for mind except as a
byproduct of the brain. Evolution acts upon physical organs and
organisms. Claiming that the mind is the chance product of the
evolution of the brain is without meaning or significance. In
addition, the mind matches the universe: the universe is rational,
accessible to the mind, and describable by mathematics.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I intend to write in more detail about each of these, but I think as a
list they are interesting. In general, I am always wary about saying
that there will be things that science will never explain. I am reminded
of a quote from French positivist, Auguste Compte from 1835. In his
Cours de la Philosophie Positive he wrote the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&gt; On the subject of stars, all investigations which are not ultimately
&gt; reducible to simple visual observations are ... necessarily denied to
&gt; us. While we can conceive of the possibility of determining their
&gt; shapes, their sizes, and their motions, we shall never be able by any
&gt; means to study their chemical composition or their mineralogical
&gt; structure ... Our knowledge concerning their gaseous envelopes is
&gt; necessarily limited to their existence, size ... and refractive power,
&gt; we shall not at all be able to determine their chemical composition or
&gt; even their density... I regard any notion concerning the true mean
&gt; temperature of the various stars as forever denied to us.
&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was clearly stating that those objects that were &lt;em&gt;physically&lt;/em&gt;
inaccessible were inaccessible to our &lt;em&gt;knowledge&lt;/em&gt;, at least in detail.
It wasn't much after that quote when &lt;a href="http://astronomyonline.org/Science/Spectroscopy.asp"&gt;spectroscopy was first used to
determine the contents of stars&lt;/a&gt;, from the pattern of spectral lines,
and the temperature was determined from the &lt;a href="http://docs.kde.org/stable/en/kdeedu/kstars/ai-colorandtemp.html"&gt;peak in the "rainbow" of
light emitted from the stars&lt;/a&gt;. Further, we can determine the &lt;a href="http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr162/lect/binaries/mass.html"&gt;mass of
stars from Kepler's laws&lt;/a&gt; and thus its density from the mass and the
size. Perhaps Compte just didn't have enough imagination! It's a lesson
we can all learn when dealing with challenging problems.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="wordpress_migration"></category></entry><entry><title>Conversation with Steve Winsor</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2011/Dec/06/conversation-with-steve-winsor/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-12-06T15:32:00-05:00</published><updated>2011-12-06T15:32:00-05:00</updated><author><name>brianblais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2011-12-06:/posts/2011/Dec/06/conversation-with-steve-winsor/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not claiming there is a God or not...some days I think there could be
and other days I think there just can't be (especially after some awful
tragedy involving children, for example). I mentioned in an e-mail the
other day that I believe, on balance, religion has more good associated
with it than bad...and that the bad exists because humans are involved
in managing it. But, on balance, I think a country that, while
recognizing separation of government of religion, needs the 'moral
anchor' that religion provides (i.e., be good, go to Heaven; be bad, off
to Hell with you). A purely secular society, in my humble opinion, would
eventually lead to a society without an innate sense of good or
bad...'moral relativism' is what it is called these days. We're already
seeing moral relativism at play in the rampant 'political correctness'
abounding in this country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, while I have little use personally for organized
religion, I think it's good for other people (i.e. "do as I say, don't
do as I do"...yes, a bit hypocritical J). And I do think Reagan is right
in the last comment...on balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think Sweden is an exception. Being 1/4 Swedish myself, I am pleased
of course that they handle their affairs well. And I wonder how secular
they really are...there is no significant number of churches in Sweden?
Or are they pagans? J And is it possible they use a moral compass based
on a Western European culture that has, as its underpinning, a moral
structure based on the Christian church?..after all, it's not like they
are in East Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brian, got this from Wikipedia (below in bold): a mixed bag it
seems...there was state church until 2000...as of 2010, 70% of Swedes
are members of the Church of Sweden...but religion is not a big part of
their life (17%). On balance, I'd say Sweden is not secular. The
Lutheran Church has surely brought a moral code/compass of some sort to
Swedish society over the centuries. And no...I didn't write up the
Wikipedia passage.J&lt;/p&gt;

&gt; &lt;em&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Religion in Sweden (Wikipedia):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sweden was Christianized from Norse paganism in the 11th century.
Since the 16th century, Sweden has been predominantly Lutheran. From
the Protestant Reformation in the 1530s until 2000, the Lutheran
Church of Sweden (Swedish: Svenska kyrkan) was the state church. As of
2010, about 70% of Swedes are members of the Church of Sweden,
compared to over 95% in 1970, and 83% in 2000.[1] Religiosity in
Sweden plays a limited role compared to the European average. In a
2009 Gallup poll, 17% answered yes to the question "Is religion an
important part of your daily life?".[2] Less than 4% of the Church of
Sweden membership attends public worship during an average week; about
2% are regular attendees.[3]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;vague deists, mostly, and about 1/4 atheists...seems reasonably secular
to me, because the morality arguments stem not from deism but from
theism, of which only about 1/4 are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;clearly not perfectly secular, but way more secular than the US, and
most measures of societal health (lifespan, infant mortality, per capita
charity, crime rate, etc...) are better in Sweden. Now, of course there
are other issues (homogeneity of the population, population size,
etc...) but this trend exists pretty much across Europe, and at minimum
proves that more religiosity doesn't necessarily improve a society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another interesting view of it by astrophysicist Bernard Haisch. He
mentions 'exceptional human experiences' below (ex. My Royal Flush
Ace-high scenario?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one thing that seems to stand out for me re: 'is there a God?' is
the organized structure of the Universe...and the ability for it to
allow organic 'life' (which may be reasonably spread throughout this
galaxies and most others). Was there some type of over-arching
intelligence that created the Universe? That's what nags at me...and
suggests that to declare there is no 'god' (or vastly superior
intelligence capable of affecting the enormous structure of the
Universe) because there is no direct proof (and there never can be
presumably) is not the end of the story. Think I'll keep hedging my bet.
J&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other matter bears looking at. Is 'good vs. evil' simply a
human-created phenomenon?...or is it circumstantial evidence that there
may be that over-arching intelligence somewhere in existence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&gt; &lt;em&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there an intelligence behind the origin of the Universe?
Bestsellers by Christopher Hitchins,Richard Dawkins and, Sam
Harrishave denounced the evils of religion and proclaimed that science
has shown that there is no God. Their angry accusations are partially
correct. Religions have been used to justify crimes against humanity:
witness the Inquisition of centuries past or the sectarian slaughter
in the Mideast today. But the human misuse of religions and the
existence of God are very different matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A remarkable discovery has emerged in astrophysics: that key
properties of the Universe have just the right values to make life
possible. Most scientists prefer to explain away this uniqueness,
insisting that a huge, perhaps infinite, number of unseen universes
must therefore exist, each randomly different from the other. That way
ours only appears special because we could not exist in any of the
other hypothetical universes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I propose the alternative that the special properties of our universe
reflect an underlying intelligence, one that is consistent with the
Big Bang and Darwinian evolution. Both views are equally logical and
beyond proof. However exceptional human experiences and accounts of
mystics throughout the ages do suggest that we live in a purposeful
universe. In The God Theory and The Purpose-Guided Universe: Believing
In Einstein, Darwin, and GodI speculate on what that purpose might
be... what that purpose means for our lives... how it might explain
the riddle of evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other Books on God - Pro and Con&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advances are made by answering questions. Discoveries are made by
questioning answers. - Bernard Haisch&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brian, regarding your statistics below: I would add the 23% to the 53%
of 'I believe there is some sort of spirit or life force' and you get
76%. I think Sweden flunks the 'secular test'. The existence of 'spirit
or life force' (53%) is the driver for human desire to seek guidance for

&gt;  Another interesting view of it by astrophysicist Bernard Haisch. He
&gt; mentions 'exceptional human experiences' below (ex. My Royal Flush
&gt; Ace-high scenario?).  
&gt; *
&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;actually, he doesn't actually say what the "exceptional human
experiences" are. if they are something like what is claimed by mystics,
then these sorts of experiences have been had by Christians, Muslims,
and atheists which demonstrates that these experience do not present any
evidence for any particular doctrine. Further, we can elicit these
experiences with chemical and electrical stimulation, which is strong
evidence that they are the product of the functioning of the brain. I am
the first to say that our knowledge of the brain is at its infancy, but
we know enough that we don't need to resort to metaphysical
interpretations of the nature of the cosmos from changes in someone
conscious experience. Sam Harris speaks to this a great deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&gt; *  
&gt;  The one thing that seems to stand out for me re: 'is there a God?' is
&gt; the organized structure of the Universe...and the ability for it to
&gt; allow organic 'life' (which may be reasonably spread throughout this
&gt; galaxies and most others).  
&gt; *
&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;first, nearly all of the universe is hostile to life, so it is hardly
"tuned" for the flourishing of life. second, organization is the result
of the natural laws. where do these laws come from? we don't know for
sure, yet, but some of them we can already see become unified at large
energies so there need not be as much "tuning" as one might think at
first glance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&gt; *  
&gt;  there is no direct proof (and there never can be presumably) is not
&gt; the end of the story.  
&gt; *
&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sorry, you can't use that dodge either. never can be any proof? Are you
suggesting that God couldn't provide it if he wanted? Are you suggesting
that if God left an imprint into the universe, that it would not be
directly observable? if you are, then pretty much you're conceding that
there is no difference between an intelligence guiding events and
natural laws guiding events, in which case there is no point to the
intelligence. also, proof doesn't exist in science (only in math and
philosophy). all I'm looking for is evidence, and there sure isn't any,
or it's all really terrible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&gt; *  
&gt;  One other matter bears looking at. Is 'good vs. evil' simply a
&gt; human-created phenomenon?  
&gt; *
&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;again, look at the links I pointed to earlier from Sam Harris. this is
the issue he deals with. it's an argument, that I happen to agree with,
for an absolute morality completely divorced from any religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&gt; *  
&gt;  Think I'll keep hedging my bet. J  
&gt; *
&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so you should be concerned that you're not a Muslim then, because the
Koran clearly states that those who do not follow Mohammad will be
doomed. Or you should be concerned that you're not a Buddhist... perhaps
you should hedge your bet around santa claus, or chiropracting, or
homeopathy, or the easter bunny? or the flying spaghetti monster?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a very strange god indeed that wants people to believe in him on
bad evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&gt; *  
&gt;  Brian, regarding your statistics below: I would add the 23% to the
&gt; 53% of 'I believe there is some sort of spirit or life force' and you
&gt; get 76%.  
&gt; *
&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn't, because spirit or life force is pretty much the vague
notions of stuff people don't understand. it doesn't guide their
actions, and certainly is not the basis of any morality. practically
speaking, Sweden (and much of Scandinavia) are *mostly* secular, and
trending more so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&gt; *  
&gt;  I think Sweden flunks the 'secular test'. The existence of 'spirit or
&gt; life force' (53%) is the driver for human desire to seek guidance for
&gt; behavior/justice from someone/something above Man.  
&gt; *
&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sorry, that's not correct. it doesn't say something "above" man. those
people who believe in a life force or spirit simply believe that there
is more to man than the physical. usually they are thinking of the mind,
and their understanding of neurobiology is weak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&gt; *  
&gt;  I think it's an innate need...and comes from the very thing you are
&gt; interested in...the human mind. The question is...does it really
&gt; exist?...and, if so, does it inhabit the subconscious mind...or
&gt; conscious?  
&gt; *
&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;what is the "it" here? are you speaking of consciousness separate from
the brain? our understanding of consciousness is not at the point where
we can conclusively state that. there is certainly no evidence for it,
and everything so far points to consciousness arising from the
functioning of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that is clear, historically, is that people tend to think they
are special, and build descriptions and stories around this specialness.
What is also clear historically, in every case where we have been able
to determine it, we are not special. Life molecules can arise from
non-life - the chemistry is the same. We are on a tiny planet, not in
the center of any universe, galaxy or solar system. We are one of many
solar systems, probably many with life. "heavenly matter" is no
different than "earthly matter" - the laws of physics are the same here
as across the universe and across time. humans are primates, and are
directly descended from animals that gave rise to chimps too. Our moral
sense is shared, to some extent, in other animals as well. Our brains
work like monkey brains and cat brains, and the parts work just like the
parts of worm brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To some, this is discouraging. I, however, find some comfort in the
notion that we are all connected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGK84Poeynk"&gt;We are all connected&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

their religious convictions, chooses not to participate in scientific
research (the example used was nuclear bomb research) because of the
harm it would give?". When they asked it, it was clear that they thought
it was a significant argument for the benefits of religion. At the time,
I didn't have the time to go into a lengthy response, so I wanted to put
it here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If someone, out of a genuine concern for the suffering of other
individuals, chooses to forgo research which they felt would lead to the
needless suffering of those individuals, then I would support it. I
could possibly criticize their assessment of the harm (i.e. would this
research definitely cause harm, or at least, more harm than good? what
is the cost of &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; pursuing the research? etc...) This is a
perfectly &lt;strong&gt;secular&lt;/strong&gt; rationale for the ethical decision, and we could
have a discussion, but as long as their motivation was for the genuine
well-being of humans (or even animals), then I don't have a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if you make the &lt;strong&gt;same decision&lt;/strong&gt; because you felt that the
creator of the universe wants you to do it, or you will be punished by
the creator if you don't do it, or you will be rewarded by the creator
for doing it then I do not support it...it may be the right decision but
for the wrong reasons. The problem with making the right decision for
the wrong reasons is that you would, next week, make wrong decisions for
the same reasons. If you're not held to a legitimate ethical argument,
grounded in the well-being of individuals and societies, then you can
justify blocking stem cell research and gay marriage for the same
"reasons" that you use to direct your own "moral" choices. Further, if
you are allowed to simply say "my religion tells me this is true", then
that ends all discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too many people assume that just because it comes from someone's
religion then is it correct, or moral, or ethical...it doesn't. We
establish the evidence supporting arguments for moral actions through
discussion, critical thinking, and the application of reason...towards
the betterment of the conditions for all conscious creatures. When faith
stands in for a reasoned ethical argument, then the result will at some
point lead to seriously unethical decisions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="wordpress_migration"></category></entry><entry><title>Best evidence for...</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2011/Nov/29/best-evidence-for/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-11-29T12:12:00-05:00</published><updated>2011-11-29T12:12:00-05:00</updated><author><name>brianblais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2011-11-29:/posts/2011/Nov/29/best-evidence-for/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In preparing for a talk on Science and Religion, I came upon this

list of evidence, direct observations, measurements, etc... In the last
case there are philosophical arguments.  The differences in the amount,
quality, and type of evidence shown in these sources I think is
particularly telling.  When you ask for evidence for the existence of
something, and you get philosophical arguments, then I think you can
immediately dismiss the claim.  I would also claim (and someone tell me
if there is a counter example please!) that there is not a single
example of the existence of an actual thing being first or best
established from a philosophical argument.  &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="wordpress_migration"></category></entry><entry><title>A sensible post on climate change...for a change</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2011/Nov/09/a-sensible-post-on-climate-change-for-a-change/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-11-09T12:21:00-05:00</published><updated>2011-11-09T12:21:00-05:00</updated><author><name>brianblais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2011-11-09:/posts/2011/Nov/09/a-sensible-post-on-climate-change-for-a-change/</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wattsupwiththat.com/2011/11/01/thank-you-matt-ridley/"&gt;A very reasoned addition&lt;/a&gt; to the climate change discussion.

moving into graduate school, is that scientists have a peculiar sort of
conservative language. They'll say things like, "it's possible that such
and such", or "it's likely that such and such" but rarely (if ever) say
"such and such is true". &lt;a href="https://brianblais.wordpress.com/2011/10/16/faster-than-light-a-likely-solution/"&gt;In a previous post&lt;/a&gt;I said that a proposed
solution to the faster than light neutrinos was likely to be true, but
left open the possibility that the error will probably be found
elsewhere. As solid as relativity is, scientists will still never say
that relativity is "true", only that is it very well established,
confirmed, supported, etc... In any other context, something with as
much support as, say, the theory of relativity or the theory of
evolution or the germ theory of disease would simple be called "fact".
In science, calling something like that a fact is both wrong (it can
still be modified!) and dangerous (it stops all inquiry!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paraphrasing the words of Sam Harris, pretending to know things that you
do not know, or claiming certainty for things for which there is not

I have spoken to say it's not a big deal, it's a historical object, it's

that, for example. However, the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Establishment_Clause"&gt;Establishment Clause&lt;/a&gt; of the
&lt;a href="http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution.html"&gt;Constitution&lt;/a&gt; clearly states "Congress shall make no law respecting
an establishment of religion". Christians will point to this mural and
state that it is generically religious, and thus is not the
establishment of any particular religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first read this mural, I was immediately offended by it, as a
message in a public institution educating children. It establishes a
clear bias towards the Abrahamic faiths (Judaism, Christianity, and
Islam) by referring to "Heavenly Father". Buddhism doesn't have this,
neither does Hinduism, or Paganism, or etc.... not to mention atheists.
The message itself is actually very nice, so why not do the easiest
thing: Block out, in as unobtrusive way possible, the "Heavenly father"
and the "Amen", and simply call it the School Doctrine, or School
Message, or some other innocuous phrase. Even calling it a prayer is not
so bad in my book, as long as there isn't a clear bias towards a
particular religion. I wonder if the student tried to do that. It would
seem to be a straightforward solution, that a school system might
consider, in order to keep itself out of a lawsuit on the issue.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="wordpress_migration"></category></entry><entry><title>The Florida problem - a new intuition</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2011/Oct/30/the-florida-problem-a-new-intuition/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-10-30T13:35:00-04:00</published><updated>2011-10-30T13:35:00-04:00</updated><author><name>brianblais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2011-10-30:/posts/2011/Oct/30/the-florida-problem-a-new-intuition/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.

compares the following two situations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say you know a family has two children, and further that at least one
of them is a girl. What is the probability that they have two girls?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say you know a family has two children, and further that at least one
of them is a girl named Florida. What is the probability that they
have two girls?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former is easy to show is $latex {p(2g|\{L1g\})=1/3}&amp;amp;fg=000000$.
The latter is shown to be $latex {p(2g|\{L1g\},F)=1/2}&amp;amp;fg=000000$.
Intuition firmly insists that knowing the name shouldn't change the
probability, but the math and simulations insist otherwise. Thus, it is
our duty, to try to get our intuition around the problem. I was
motivated to look at this again when a commenter asked&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can someone tell me what the relevance of the comparative
rarity/commonness of the girl's name is? Suppose instead we knew that
the girl's name was "Mary". The possibilities would still work out the
same:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B GM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GM b&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GM GNM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GM GM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GNM GM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After much pondering, I think I have come up with another way to recast
the problem that adds to the intuition. I can't say that it makes it
completely obvious to me, like the &lt;a href="https://brianblais.wordpress.com/2009/09/16/probability-problems-and-simulation/"&gt;Monty Hall problem&lt;/a&gt; is for me now,
so I think there still is something missing in my understanding of &lt;em&gt;why
the problem is so unintuitive&lt;/em&gt;. However, it does seem to push the idea a
bit farther forward. In the next section I introduce another problem,
with similar properties but is possibly more intuitive. I then describe
how it can be used to gain an intuition on the Florida problem, and why
the frequency of the name can make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. A Card Game&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say I play a game with a very small deck (just so that we can work the
numbers well). The deck has 8 cards: Ace, two, three, and four of hearts
and the five, six, seven, and eight of spades. Two cards are dealt, and
you are given some modest information about the two cards, and asked to
determine the probability that the two cards are both hearts. Let's look
at three types of information given:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You're only told that there are two cards.&lt;/em&gt; Thus, there the
    probability for two hearts is simply&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$latex \displaystyle p(2H) = \frac{4}{8} \times {3}{7} =
\frac{12}{56} \ \ \ \ \ (1)&amp;amp;fg=000000$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be seen pictorially by listing every possible two-card hand
and looking at those with two hearts, yielding 12 hands out of 56.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://brianblais.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/fig1.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
2.  &lt;em&gt;You're told that at least one of the cards is a heart&lt;/em&gt;. Now we need
to look at the first and second cards, and eliminate the possibility
of two spades&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$latex \displaystyle p(2H|\{L1H\}) =
\frac{p(H_1,H_2)}{p(H_1,S_2)+p(S_1,H_2)+p(H_1,H_2)} \ \&lt;br&gt;
   \ \ \ (2)&amp;amp;fg=000000$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where $latex {p(H_1,S_2)}&amp;amp;fg=000000$ is that we drew a heart
then a spade. We then have&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$latex \displaystyle \begin{array}{rcl} p(2H|\{L1H\}) &amp;amp;=&amp;amp;
\frac{\frac{4}{8}\times\frac{3}{7}}{\frac{4}{8}\times\frac{4}{7}+\frac{4}{8}\times\frac{4}{7}+\frac{4}{8}\times\frac{3}{7}}\\&lt;br&gt;
   &amp;amp;=&amp;amp;\frac{12}{44} \end{array} &amp;amp;fg=000000$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be seen pictorially by listing every possible two-card hand
&lt;em&gt;with at least one heart&lt;/em&gt; and looking at those with two hearts,
yielding 12 hands out of 44.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="2" src="http://brianblais.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/fig2.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You're told that at least one of the cards is an ace of hearts&lt;/em&gt;.
    Notice how this changes things. Now, when we outline the
    possibilities, we get&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$latex \displaystyle p(2H|\{L1H\},A) =
\frac{p(H_{1a},H_{2n})+p(H_{1n},H_{2a})}{p(H_{1a},H_{2n})+p(H_{1n},H_{2a})+p(S_{1},H_{2a})+p(H_{1a},S_2)}
\ \ \ \ \ (3)&amp;amp;fg=000000$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's look at the numerator first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$latex \displaystyle p(H_{1a},H_{2n}) =
p(H_{2n}|H_{1a})p(H_{1a}) \ \ \ \ \ (4)&amp;amp;fg=000000$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written like this, it is like turning over card one, seeing it's an
ace of hearts, and then turning over card 2. $latex
{p(H_{1a})=1/8}&amp;amp;fg=000000$, and seeing a heart that is not an ace
is really the same as seeing any ol' heart, so it is $latex
{p(H_{2n}|H_{1a})=3/7}&amp;amp;fg=000000$. This is not any different than
the previous situation. However, the next term in the numerator&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$latex \displaystyle p(H_{1n},H_{2a}) =
p(H_{2a}|H_{1n})p(H_{1n}) \ \ \ \ \ (5)&amp;amp;fg=000000$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; really different, because we are told that there is at least
one ace. The probability of drawing a heart that is not an ace on
the first card is still $latex {p(H_{1n})=3/8}&amp;amp;fg=000000$.
However, drawing an ace of hearts on the second card when we drew a
non-ace of hearts on the first is &lt;em&gt;certain&lt;/em&gt;, because we have
knowledge that at least one is an ace. Thus, $latex
{p(H_{2a}|H_{1n})=1}&amp;amp;fg=000000$. This gives, for the numerator,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$latex \displaystyle
p(H_{1a},H_{2n})+p(H_{1n},H_{2a})=\frac{3}{7}\cdot\frac{1}{8}
+ 1\cdot \frac{3}{8} = \frac{24}{56} \ \ \ \ \&lt;br&gt;
   (6)&amp;amp;fg=000000$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that if $latex {H_{2a}}&amp;amp;fg=000000$ had been independent of
$latex {H_{1n}}&amp;amp;fg=000000$ then we would have gotten the same
12/56 term in the numerator as in the previous situation.
Essentially, by giving the information that there is at least one
ace, you are really making the value of one card dependent on the
other, and thus knowledge of one gives you knowledge of the other
and the probability for two hearts goes up. The same thing happens
with $latex {p(H_{2a}|S_1)}&amp;amp;fg=000000$, but since we compare to
the case where we know there is one heart anyway, this is not a
difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following through with the rest gives us&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$latex \displaystyle \begin{array}{rcl} p(2H|\{L1H\},A) &amp;amp;=&amp;amp;
\frac{p(H_{1a},H_{2n})+p(H_{1n},H_{2a})}{p(H_{1a},H_{2n})+p(H_{1n},H_{2a})+p(S_{1},H_{2a})+p(H_{1a},S_2)}
\\ &amp;amp;=&amp;amp;\frac{\frac{3}{7}\cdot\frac{1}{8}+ 1 \cdot
\frac{3}{8}}{\frac{4}{7}\cdot\frac{1}{8}+1\cdot
\frac{4}{8}+\frac{24}{56}}\\ &amp;amp;=&amp;amp;\frac{24}{56} = \frac{6}{14}
\end{array} &amp;amp;fg=000000$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be seen pictorially by listing every possible two-card hand
with an ace of hearts and looking at those with two hearts, yielding
6 hands out of 14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="3" src="http://brianblais.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/fig3.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Back to the Florida problem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ace-of-hearts problem is exactly like the Florida problem, if you
make the deck big enough. The key issue here seems to be that by giving
a rare name to one of the girl children, it correlates the two children
in a way that the independence assumptions in both the simpler problem
and one's intuition break down. If you were to ``draw'' a girl first
and not a Florida, then we &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; have a girl second named Florida. In
the same way, the game show host in Monty Hall is forced to give
information to the contestant through the rules of the game: 2/3 of the
time he is forced to give the contestant the door with the prize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing to notice is that the frequency of the ``aces'' (or
Floridas) in the problem definitely has an effect. You can confirm this
by changing the information in the card game to &lt;em&gt;You're told that at
least one of the cards has a rank less than three&lt;/em&gt;. It is easy to see
how this would change the probabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.1. Intuition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why is this problem so unintuitive? I think a lot of it is related to
the issues that Jeff J states in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But suppose you learned what you know about this family because you
meet the mother walking with her daughter, and asked her how many
children she has. When she said “two,” this scenario fits the problem
statement just as well as what Brian assumed. You know the family has
two children, and that at least one is a girl. But, the probability is
1/2 that she has two daughters, not 1/3 (reference: Bar-Hillel and
Falk, or look at Grinstead and Snell's on-line textbook).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a certain ``omniscience'' assumed in the card game (not so
unrealistically) and in the Florida problem (probably unrealistically)
that changes the scope of the problem. Most people's intuitions are
shaped by the cases like Jeff J, where we know of a specific child named
Florida, and asked about the chances of having another girl which is
1/2, or even know only that there is at least one girl, but a specific
one, so you get the 1/3 when thinking about it. The name, therefore,
doesn't affect anything...in most realistic situations. However, in this
card game it does affect the chances of having two hearts when you are
restricted to the hands with at least one ace of hearts. I find that it
doesn't seem to violate my intuition as badly in the card game as it
does in the Florida , and much more clearly and it doesn't seem to
violate our intuitions quite so badly.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="wordpress_migration"></category></entry><entry><title>Faster than light...a likely solution</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2011/Oct/16/faster-than-light-a-likely-solution/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-10-16T12:11:00-04:00</published><updated>2011-10-16T12:11:00-04:00</updated><author><name>brianblais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2011-10-16:/posts/2011/Oct/16/faster-than-light-a-likely-solution/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/arxiv/27260/"&gt;solution to the "faster-than-light" neutrinos&lt;/a&gt; is likely to have

"I try to stick to law-related topics, but every once in a while I'll
delve into matters that are way over my head, like college sports and
even physics." He should stick to law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His post makes the following two claims:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;physicists created the concept of "dark matter" simply to keep
    Einstein's theory of general relativity alive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The speed of light, Einstein had said, was the fastest speed at
    which anything could move. If an object could move faster than that,
    then Einstein's theories would be proved incorrect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He concludes with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully scientists won't continue to cling to Einstein's theories if
it's not warranted. The hallmark of science has always been its
willingness to discard what no longer works when new evidence comes
along. And toward that end, here's an admittedly uneducated
suggestion: abandon Einstein's quest of unifying the quantum with the
cosmic. [...] it appears that such an attempt is doomed to failure
because one of the theories they're attempting to unify is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the drawing board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is ill-informed for many reasons. Let me try to address a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dark Matter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter"&gt;dark matter&lt;/a&gt; was not invented to keep Einstein's
theory alive, it was invented to keep &lt;em&gt;Newton's&lt;/em&gt; theory alive (which
Einstein's General Theory of Relativity is consistent with, and extends
to new areas). Essentially, given the form of Newton's law, we can
estimate the mass of a galaxy from its spinning. It turns out that this
method of measuring the mass yields 10 times the mass that we get by
estimating it from the directly observed mass (i.e. from counting up the
the light emitted by the mass). We then have several choices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the counting up the light method underestimates mass by a factor of
    10...this is highly unlikely, because the method has been consistent
    with many other measurements, and is a direct consequence of
    fundamental laws of physics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Newton's laws are wrong&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is more mass than we can actually see...we give it a name,
    "dark matter", just as a place-holder until we could determine what
    it is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guess what? Scientists have explored all these possibilities! The most
relevant ones to this post have to do with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modified_Newtonian_dynamics"&gt;MOND (Modified Newtonian
Dynamics)&lt;/a&gt;. For example, Newton's law of gravity is of the form&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="katex-error" style="color:#cc0000" title="ParseError: KaTeX parse error: Can't use function '$' in math mode at position 1: $̲  F=\frac{GMm}{…"&gt;$ 
F=\frac{GMm}{r^2} = ma 
&lt;/span&gt;$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consequences of this have been checked out many decimal places, and
explains things as diverse as the tides, the formation of planetary
rings, and the development of galaxies. What would it take to displace
this? You'd have to modify it in such a way as to be consistent with all
of the things that it predicts well, as accurately as it currently
predicts, and have your modifications be consistent with some other set
of observations which are inconsistent with the current theory. This is
why it took 200 years to significantly modify Newton's Theory of
Gravity, with Einsteins General Theory of Relativity. An example of MOND
could be something like&lt;/p&gt;

close to 1 for normal situations (and thus look like Newton's laws), but
be different for the case of spinning galaxies. In this case there is a

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="katex-error" style="color:#cc0000" title="ParseError: KaTeX parse error: Can't use function '$' in math mode at position 1: $̲ \mu(x) = 1-e^{…"&gt;$ \mu(x) = 1-e^{-x}

&lt;p&gt;Near the Earth, this translates to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the big scale, on the outskirts of galaxies, the accelerations are
comparable to &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mi&gt;a&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;o&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding="application/x-tex"&gt;a_o&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut" style="height:0.5806em;vertical-align:-0.15em;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist" style="height:0.1514em;"&gt;&lt;span style="top:-2.55em;margin-left:0em;margin-right:0.05em;"&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal mtight"&gt;o&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist" style="height:0.15em;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the predictions can lead to
consistent mass curves without introducing more mass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dark matter postulate has also been, and continues to be, explored.
There are some theoretical reasons to suggest that dark matter exists in
the form of new fundamental particles, and there are attempts now to
directly measure them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point here is that the original post was &lt;em&gt;completely wrong&lt;/em&gt; about
the motivation to include dark matter. Further, it was wrong in implying
that scientists don't examine and try to replace well-established ideas.
I tell my students that it is a good day if you can demonstrate that one
of your colleagues is wrong. It is an even better day if you can
overturn a well-established idea (you get phone calls from Sweden for
this). However, the burden is on the scientist trying to overturn a
well-established idea to put forward something that is both consistent
with all of the observations of the previous theory, and to demonstrate
consistency on new tests that yield a different (and thus wrong) result
from the old theory. Thus, it gets harder and harder to overturn an idea
that is well established in science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Speed of Light&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let me point out that Einstein doesn't say in his 1905 paper on
Special Relativity that the speed of light is the maximum speed (note,
this is different than General Relativity, which handles gravity...a
distinction that Michael Cicchini doesn't seem to grasp). He merely
asserts that the speed of light is measured to be constant in all
inertial reference frames (i.e. measurements made in situations of
constant speed). The derivation of the maximum speed is a consequence of
this, and results in the Lorentz transformation. What we see in these
equations is a factor entering in throughout of the form&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which would allow speeds greater than the speed of light. This
simplistic hack will break other parts of the theory, and so a more
subtle modification would be needed, but it could certainly be
done...and it wouldn't require overturning Einstein's theory. We must be
particularly observant of the following two facts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;relativistic quantum mechanics (QED) makes predictions so accurate,
    it would be like predicting the width of North America to the width
    of a human hair...&lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; replacement theory would need to do as well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one other significant observation of neutrinos comes from supernova
    explosions, many light years away. It is observed that the neutrinos
    reaches us at the time, or very slightly below the time that the
    light from the explosion reaches us. Thus, over far longer spans of
    space there is no observed violation of the speed of light limit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the neutrino story is intriguing, it does not entail the
overthrow of Einstein even if it turns out to be true. More likely it
will not be true, however. The biggest lesson of this is that lawyers
should not speak about physics (although to be fair, Edwin Hubble, the
discoverer of the expansion of the universe, was a lawyer before he
became an astronomer). My bet is still on Einstein, no matter what the
result of the experiment is. This isn't because I am dogmatically
attached to Einstein's ideas, but that his ideas have been tested to an
astonishing degree, and any replacement will have to do just as well.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="wordpress_migration"></category></entry><entry><title>Mystery, Knowledge, Science and Television</title><link href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2011/Aug/03/mystery-knowledge-science-and-television/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-08-03T12:44:00-04:00</published><updated>2011-08-03T12:44:00-04:00</updated><author><name>brianblais</name></author><id>tag:bblais.github.io,2011-08-03:/posts/2011/Aug/03/mystery-knowledge-science-and-television/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;J J Abrams, the creator of the television show “Lost”, gives a &lt;a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/j_j_abrams_mystery_box.html"&gt;Ted

talk&lt;/a&gt; where he suggests that sometimes mystery is more important than
knowledge. His “mystery box” represents infinite possibilities and hope
and that mystery is the catalyst for imagination. He sees the “Lost”
television show as a mystery box, always with the sense of possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, to be fair, I have not actually seen Lost, so perhaps my comments
are unwarranted, but I decided not to watch Lost for the following
reason. When Lost was first beginning, several friends said that I would
like it. I told them that I would watch it if, and only if, at the end
of the series they could tell me that the “plan” for the series actually
existed. It was claimed that the series was planned from start to
finish, but my friends told me afterward that it was clear it wasn’t,
after watching the finale. Too many loose ends, too many mysteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that J J Abrams learned the wrong lesson about mystery, as
represented by his television show “Lost”. It’s not just the mystery,
for the sake of mystery, it is the solving of the mystery that yields
more mysteries. Scientists are comfortable with not knowing...we are
constantly at the edge of what is known and not known. However, what
motivates the scientist isn’t the mystery, it is the solution to the
mystery knowing that will open up more. There is nothing more
dissatisfying than a book, movie, or television show that just opens up
more and more “mysteries” and never resolves them...it seems artificial
and disorganized. Most people assume that the mysteries will be solved
by the end, so they allow themselves to be taken in by the mysteries.
However, once it becomes clear that the mysteries are not going to be
solved, most lose their attention and become disenchanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What made Babylon 5 so engaging was that there was a plan, and you could
count on it. You knew that if there was a mystery, that you’d see the
resolution of it. I’ll admit that the resolution of the main conflict
(the Shadow War) was a bit disappointing, once it happened, but I think
part of that feeling had to do with pace and not with the resolution
itself. Mystery for the sake of mystery is enough to motivate,
temporarily, but not forever. In the real world, solving mysteries opens
up more...that’s the real motivator!&lt;/p&gt;

current climate models ignore the effect of conduction (i.e. direct
contact) and convection, and focus exclusively on the greenhouse gas
radiative effect. A comment to that post needs a full response. The
comment in full is here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I almost bought your discussion until you provided the diagram from
Kiehl and Trenberth which is ludicrous. The whole construct here is to
create the illusion that the sun cannot heat the earth above minus 18
which is absolute nonsense based on assuming it is valid on geometric
grounds to reduce the solar insolation by a factor of 4 then again by
the albedo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is valid how then does the surface temperature of the moon reach
\~123 C - quoted by NASA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how do you explain daytime temperatures on Earth in excess of 50 C
as has been recorded ?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will focus on the Moon part, just because it is the easiest, but it
will be natural to see how to approach this for the Earth as well.
First, I must point out the irony of the comment. In trying to defend
the claim that the climate models ignore conduction and convection, and
focus exclusively on radiation, the comment refers to a system (the
Moon) where there is no atmosphere and thus no conduction (except within
the ground itself) or convection! Second I have to wonder about how
stupid the commenter thinks NASA is. Do they really think that
scientists would consider models that are flagrantly in conflict with
the most basic observation about the Moon’s surface (i.e. its
temperature extremes)? Do they really think that scientists would come
up with a calculation that Moon can’t achieve temperatures above, say,
-18 C and then stare at 100 C temperature measurements and just leave
the calculation as is for decades? Let’s consider how one would develop
a model of the surface temperature of the Moon, and it will answer the
objections raised in the comment, as well as outline how real science
actually progresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:15pt;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Average Blackbody Model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We start with a very simple model of a spherical body out in space
receiving input from the Sun to the tune of 1400
W/m&lt;span style="vertical-align:super;"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;. At the same time, the
spherical body emits radiation with a power per square meter dependent
on T&lt;span style="vertical-align:super;"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; (i.e. the blackbody
law).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Untitled-2011-07-28-05-45.png" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-vYTzgPcRcyo/TjHqHeo8lTI/AAAAAAAAJWk/YWfC7X_Xmuc/Untitled-2011-07-28-05-45.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that in this very simple model we are assuming several things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that the conduction &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; the body is instantaneous, thus the
    temperature of the body is uniform, and the output energy is
    uniform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the body is not rotating, so the radiation it is receiving is
    constant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is no atmosphere, thus no conduction or convection outside of
    the solid body&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the albedo is the &lt;em&gt;average&lt;/em&gt; albedo of the Moon, or a=0.14. Thus this
    object absorbs 86% of the radiation coming in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not saying this is a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; model, but it is a simple one that helps
one understand &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of the concepts at hand. We will see shortly that
it has a number of shortcomings, but for now we’ll see how far we can
push it. This is a traditional procedure in science. You start with the
simplest model you can write down, push out all the consequences you can
until the model breaks, and then introduce the needed complexities to
address those consequences (and no more!). Thus, you always have the
simplest model that is consistent with as many of the observations that
you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total energy out of the body would be the blackbody term shown,
multiplied by the total surface area of the sphere: the radiation is
outward in all directions. The incoming radiation, however, strikes only
one side. Further, it strikes at different angles. Applying calculus one
finds that the effective area is simply the cross-sectional area of the
sphere, or the area of a circle the same size as the sphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="PastedGraphic-2011-07-28-05-45.jpg" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-DFpwP3AbRBY/TjHqHva9NgI/AAAAAAAAJWo/9WZzozkdfrI/PastedGraphic-2011-07-28-05-45.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can then write down the change in the temperature, which depends on
the material (the mass and specific heat), given the net energy input to
the body. I’ll call this dependency K...its exact value, although
calculable, will not be important in the model except qualitatively. We
then have&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="PastedGraphic1-2011-07-28-05-45.jpg" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-SouO2yBsJMI/TjHqHr0RCiI/AAAAAAAAJWs/Wan5GRey3ik/PastedGraphic1-2011-07-28-05-45.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the “energy in” is greater than “energy out”, the temperature
increases. When “energy in” is &lt;em&gt;less than&lt;/em&gt; “energy out” the temperature
&lt;em&gt;decreases&lt;/em&gt;. Once it reaches equilibrium, temperature remains constant.
What constant? That would be when dT/dt=0, or...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="PastedGraphic2-2011-07-28-05-45.jpg" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-gL6eKMccMXk/TjHqH95v6YI/AAAAAAAAJWw/mFUatrZWc3g/PastedGraphic2-2011-07-28-05-45.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we look up the values for the actual Moon we get the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="PastedGraphic3-2011-07-28-05-45.jpg" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-Ploy44ZPyrw/TjHqIBOaI0I/AAAAAAAAJW0/orpTzEhRZmM/PastedGraphic3-2011-07-28-05-45.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So our model is not too bad, for the average value, but it could
probably be improved. So, now back to the comment which motivated this
all:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If this is valid how then does the surface temperature of the moon
reach \~123 C - quoted by NASA.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line here is that, if there is an observation that is in
conflict with a model, one of the assumptions of the model is probably
incorrect, or perhaps you’re comparing the wrong observations to the
model. We assumed that the object has a uniform temperature but we
&lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; from the 3 data points above (the min, max and mean temperatures)
that this is not true! Essentially our model didn’t even &lt;em&gt;attempt&lt;/em&gt; to
describe temperature variations on the surface, so it comes as no
surprise that it is not consistent with them. Many times theorists will
use a model, with known deficiencies, because they are interested in
different questions: perhaps we are only interested in the average
value, and what happens from that average value? In that case, it
doesn’t make a lot of sense to include complexities that will be
averaged out anyway when we want to answer our question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To miss this point is to miss the entire process of comparing theory
with experiment. It turns out, however, in this case we can make a few
simple modifications to explore some of the temperature variation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:15pt;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Infinitely Slow Surface-Conduction
Model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use the same assumptions as before, with one modification (in bold):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that the conduction &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; the body &lt;strong&gt;takes an infinite amount of
    time (i.e. no surface conduction at all)&lt;/strong&gt;. Thus, each patch of
    surface acts as its own independent object&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the body is not rotating, so the radiation it is receiving is
    constant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is no atmosphere, thus no conduction or convection outside of
    the solid body&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the albedo is the &lt;em&gt;average&lt;/em&gt; albedo of the Moon, or a=0.14. Thus this
    object absorbs 86% of the radiation coming in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We consider two types of patches: one on the near side and one on the
far side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Near-side patch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine a patch of surface 1 square meter, with the same albedo as the
Moon (i.e. absorbing 86%), and a combined mass and specific heat
summarized by a constant K’. The energy equation then becomes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="PastedGraphic4-2011-07-28-05-45.jpg" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-ETELFjeOiIc/TjHqIUstGGI/AAAAAAAAJW4/cee8InVHVaw/PastedGraphic4-2011-07-28-05-45.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;at equilibrium we thus have&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="PastedGraphic5-2011-07-28-05-45.jpg" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-msH1r34w0D0/TjHqIpGWduI/AAAAAAAAJW8/JjfihtD0trA/PastedGraphic5-2011-07-28-05-45.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="PastedGraphic6-2011-07-28-05-45.jpg" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-jMOJzKfly3Q/TjHqIsVVMSI/AAAAAAAAJXA/bDAj3wEuM04/PastedGraphic6-2011-07-28-05-45.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which again, is reasonably close to the real value. Notice that all we
had to do is change the conduction assumption to get surface temperature
variation. If you’re concerned that the maximum temperature predicted is
lower than the observed, notice that I am using the &lt;em&gt;average&lt;/em&gt; albedo of
the Moon. There are parts of the Moon’s surface with a lower albedo, and
will thus get hotter as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Far-side patch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now imagine a patch of surface 1 square meter, with the same albedo as
the Moon (i.e. absorbing 86%), and a combined mass and specific heat
summarized by a constant K’ but with &lt;em&gt;no sunlight at all coming in&lt;/em&gt;. The
energy equation then becomes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="PastedGraphic7-2011-07-28-05-45.jpg" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-_e7zevzi8B0/TjHqI63DYqI/AAAAAAAAJXE/8eisv6XbIZ0/PastedGraphic7-2011-07-28-05-45.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only equilibrium value for this is T=0. If no energy is coming in,
and we have energy going out, the object will keep cooling. So in this
model we have the near side T=380 K and the far side T=0 K, at
equilibrium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the model is clearly wrong, it demonstrates one thing: you can
easily get temperatures above and below the average-model calculation
simply by having not all parts of the surface heated equally, and some
non-zero time of energy “communication” (i.e. surface conduction or, if
you have an atmosphere, conduction and convection with the atmosphere)
between the parts. The extreme version calculated here simply
demonstrates the effect and is not meant to be realistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:15pt;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adding a Few More Complexities -
Qualitative Discussion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now modify the assumptions as follows&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that the conduction &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; the body &lt;strong&gt;takes a finite, non-zero,
    amount of time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the body &lt;strong&gt;rotates once every 28 days, like the Moon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is no atmosphere, thus no conduction or convection outside of
    the solid body&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the albedo is the &lt;em&gt;average&lt;/em&gt; albedo of the Moon, or a=0.14. Thus this
    object absorbs 86% of the radiation coming in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although one could set up a simple calculation, or numerical model, to
handle this case I am not going to go through the exercise. However,
there are two effects that will happen when adding these two changes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the maximum temperature predicted will be a bit lower than the
    no-conduction model. This is primarily because the moon rotates the
    near-side patch out of the the most direct sunlight relatively
    quickly. If the surface conduction is on the order of minutes, this
    will make little or no difference. If it is around hours to days
    then it will. In fact, one could use this difference to help
    determine the time constant (related to the constant K’) for the
    surface of the Moon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the minimum temperature predicted will be higher than the T=0
    predicted from the no-conduction model. This is both because the
    moon rotates the far-side patch out of the dark, and that energy
    from the previously warmed surface will conduct to the far-side
    patch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is fairly straightforward to get a model that is nearly consistent
with the observed temperature range, and is consistent with the thermal
properties of the surface of the Moon. One can get even more careful by
modifying assumption (4), and use the local albedo of the various
patches. In addition, one would need to look at all patches on the
near-side, taking into account the varying angle of inclination of the
radiation. This will not modify the qualitative results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:15pt;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all started when I criticized someone’s commentary on climate
models, where they claimed that the models exclude thermal conduction
and convection, and thus the focus on greenhouse gasses was entirely
inappropriate. A further comment claimed that these models put an
explicit maximum temperature achievable when they calculate the surface
temperature of an object from blackbody equations. The comment further
criticized my use of the &lt;em&gt;average model&lt;/em&gt; summary for the Earth for this
reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice the procedure we employed to model the system, and address these
concerns. We started with a very simple globally averaged model, and got
an interesting temperature value similar to the data. We then added a
few complexities, such a differential heating, and noticed how this
gives a range of temperatures on the surface. We also noticed that the
range was half right (half wrong?): the maximum was good, but the
minimum was terrible. Adding rotation and non-zero conduction time gives
some dynamics and can achieve reasonably close agreement. A more
detailed implementation of the local albedo fixes the small errors,
especially on the top end. By using this procedure, we can see exactly
which parts of our model give which parts of the result. It also shows
which parts of the model give the biggest effect, and which are there
for small adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that is needed to go beyond the average model, and achieve
temperature well above the average, is to include differential heating
of the surface and some non-zero time of energy “communication”. Once
you heat different parts in different ways, and add rotations and
time-delays of conductions, you get some interesting dynamics &lt;em&gt;around
the average&lt;/em&gt;, going both above and below the average. The average
calculation is still useful, if you’re not interested in short-term
dynamics. It is further useful as a pedagogical tool, because it is a
lot simpler. Thus it is not “ludicrous” to use the diagram from Kiehl
and Trenberth, as long as one is aware that this is a &lt;em&gt;globally averaged
model&lt;/em&gt;. If you attempt to infer things well beyond the point of the
model, then do not criticize the model - criticize your comparison, and
look for a more detailed model that addresses the questions that you’re
interested in.&lt;/p&gt;

science literacy. The bottom line is that the NSF is deciding to change
the wording of two questions in the survey. The original wording is
“Human beings, as we know them today, developed from earlier species of
animals,” and “The universe began with a huge explosion.” . The new
wording is “&lt;em&gt;According to evolutionary theory,&lt;/em&gt; human beings, as we know
them today, developed from earlier species of animals” and “&lt;em&gt;According
to astronomers,&lt;/em&gt; the universe began with a huge explosion.” (emphasis
mine). It is noted that there will be a transition period with the
questions, with half of the surveys containing the new questions and
half the old, to determine its effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stated goal for this change, from the NSF, is to separate knowledge
from belief. You might &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt; that humans are created in their
present form, 6000 years ago, but the new questions try to ascertain
whether you know that “evolutionary theory” says something different. Is
this an important distinction? Is this what we really want to measure?
Which is more important for a society? What is the difference between
knowledge and belief?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is quite clear that there will be at least one effect for this
rewording: given that the US falls way behind other countries on science
literacy, especially with these particular questions, the rewording will
most likely increase these numbers with no other work done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:15pt;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definitions and Concepts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beliefs are representations of the world. Specifically, they are
representations that we hold to be correct for the real world...as
opposed to hopes, which are also representations of the world by not
ones that we hold to be necessarily correct. Along with beliefs we
always have a confidence in the belief, specified as a probability
(either explicitly or implicitly). Knowledge is simply that collection
of beliefs that we hold with such high probability or, in other words,
with such confidence that we do not significantly doubt them. The belief
that the sun rises in the east each morning is considered knowledge for
the reason that we hold it with an extremely high probability. This is
not just as a result of an inductive reasoning process (i.e. it always
has, in our experience, risen in the east each morning) but because it
is part of a larger body of knowledge (i.e. astrophysics) for which it
is just one consequence within a whole host of other well-established
predictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, on to scientific literacy. The NSF defines scientific literacy as
[“knowing basic facts and concepts about science and having an
understanding of how science works.”]&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6965073194684424505-6166489707810895333?l=bblais.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Why is it important? Again, [the
NSF][“knowing basic facts and concepts about science and having an
understanding of how science works.”]: “It is valuable not only in
keeping up with important science-related issues, but also in evaluating
and assessing the validity of any type of information and participating
meaningfully in the political process.” The question we must ask is,
does the new wording measure scientific literacy better than the old
wording? To do this, we need to outline the four possible types of
people answering the two forms of the questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;people who answer “yes” to the old and “yes” to the new&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;people who answer “no” to the old and “no” to the new&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;people who answer “no” to the old and “yes” to the new&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;people who answer “yes” to the old and “no” to the new&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wording change doesn’t change cases 1 and 2, adds case 3 to the
“yes” category and it introduces the erroneous case 4. The cases can be
summarized in another way, like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;people who know both that, say, the universe began with a big
    explosion and that astronomers claim that this is true. This is
    indicative of scientific literacy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;people who don’t know, or do not believe, that the universe began
    with a big explosion and that don’t know that astronomers claim that
    this is true. This is indicative of scientific &lt;em&gt;illiteracy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;people who don’t &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt; that the universe began with a big
    explosion but know that astronomers claim that this is true. (more
    on this below)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;people who know that the universe began with a big explosion, but do
    not believe that astronomers claim that this is true. This might at
    first seem to be a totally unreasonable and marginal case, but I
    think it is more significant than perhaps is generally appreciated.
    These people might think that the new wording is a trick question
    (e.g. they might think that &lt;em&gt;physicists&lt;/em&gt;, as opposed to astronomers,
    claim that it is true). I’ve had students answer questions in this
    way, so it is not quite as uncommon as one might think. These
    students overthink the problem: they know the fact, but are
    distracted by the extra complexity of the question, thinking that
    the test is trying to trick them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:15pt;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case 3: The Religious Believer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only reason these particular questions were modified was because of
the prevalence of religious belief. How do we know this? We don’t see a
proposal to change “The Earth orbits around the Sun and takes a year to
do it” to “According to astronomers, the Earth orbits around the Sun and
takes a year to do it.” Why? Because no religion (now) has a stake in
the answer to that question, and thus have no objection to the claim. Of
course, if you go back to the days of Copernicus this was a different
story and people were severely punished for too strongly making such a
claim. The two questions that are proposed to be changed in this way are
precisely the two concepts that crop up in every creationist tract, and
are clearly the two major stumbling blocks for a literalist reading of
the Bible or the Quran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the motivation for the change, we can ask the question
whether it is accomplishing something important anyway. Are these Case 3
people, who would answer “no” to the old question but “yes” to the new
question, demonstrating scientific literacy? I don’t think so. What
they’ve confirmed is that they know that some scientists &lt;em&gt;claim&lt;/em&gt; that
the universe began with an explosion, but they don’t believe it. This
means that they don’t accept the data, or the methods, or both. If the
question were about something on the fringes of science, then perhaps
this is fine, but it isn’t the case with these two questions. Evolution
theory, for example, is as well established as the Round Earth theory
and the Germ theory of disease. To deny it is to deny all of the
&lt;em&gt;independent&lt;/em&gt; work in molecular biology, embryology, ecology, etc...
which support it. Even though they may know that fact that biologists
support Evolution theory, they have not demonstrated any scientific
literacy in terms of “evaluating and assessing the validity of any type
of information and participating meaningfully in the political process.”
The same can be said of the Big Bang theory, to a slightly lesser degree
(i.e. there isn’t &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; the volume of completely independent &lt;em&gt;fields&lt;/em&gt;
of study supporting it, as there is for Evolution, but the data is
nearly incontrovertible anyway). To deny either idea is akin to denying
the Germ theory of disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:15pt;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bottom line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine someone answering “no” to the question “The world is round” but
answers “yes” to “According to geographers, the world is round”. Would
they be demonstrating scientific literacy? I don’t think so. Do we want
to pander to the religious-motivated ignorance in this country, for the
sake of increasing the &lt;em&gt;appearance&lt;/em&gt; of scientific literacy? I don’t
think so.&lt;/p&gt;

Flaw in this Climate Argument”&lt;/a&gt;, which itself is a criticism of
someone else’s criticism of a climate model (got all that?). I only had
a very brief moment to look at the comment, but it put me in a good
mood...a mood that I don’t think would be held by a similar-type
criticism in a non-science arena. I think there is a very big difference
between the way a scientist, through training, perceives and handles
criticism which was exemplified with my mood this morning. Let me try to
explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is a very good day for a scientist to go in to work, and to
    demonstrate that one of his colleagues is wrong. It’s even better if
    the wrong idea/theory/model is one that is popular! For those
    scientists to adequately demonstrate that a popular idea is wrong,
    we have for them the Nobel Prize. Of course, it is very hard to
    demonstrate that a well-established idea is wrong because, by
    definition, a well-established idea in science is one where many
    many smart people have tried to show it is wrong and have failed.
    For those people who claim that scientists have a conspiracy to
    uphold popular scientific ideas (a criticism creationists level
    against the support of evolution), they completely miss the goals of
    every scientist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is also a good day when someone criticizes your idea. In the
    comment on my post, the criticism took the form of “if your idea is
    correct, how do you explain the following observation...”. Awesome!
    Why? First, someone bothered to read my post, and found it
    important/interesting enough to comment...that always makes me
    happy. Secondly, I’m now in a win-win situation. There are 3
    possibilities:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the criticism is flat out wrong, and I get a chance to both
    teach something, and to bolster my idea...I can be a bit more
    confident in my idea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the criticism is partly correct, and I get a chance to add a bit
    of nuance, or explore a part of my idea that I hadn’t fully
    considered&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the criticism is correct, and I have learned something about the
    world and have to modify my thinking (at the expense of
    scrapping my idea).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these 3 possibilities is wonderful, and it put me in a good
mood! In contrast, most people when criticized (think politics, sports,
religion, etc...) get defensive. They don’t look forward to the
possibility that they might be wrong, and may need to modify their
thinking. I prefer the scientific perspective!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I need to go and address the criticism.&lt;/p&gt;

idea of removing the benefits of science from those who deny science. He
starts with examples like “alien visitations to the healing power of
eskimo rituals”, and states that there is “no price for them to pay for
believing” in these ridiculous things. “They still enjoy the fruits of
science, from iPads to modern medicine, even as they profess belief in
ideas without any sound basis.” Further, “Science is not a lunch buffet.
Yes, the individual results on small, focused issues like the
coffee-bad/coffee-good debate may flip back and forth. When research
domains mature into overarching paradigms, however, its time to take
notice.” Finally, “Don't pick and choose between the science you like
and the ones you deny. Chose between science and no science at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hand in your cell phones, please.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve stated this before, in the form of removing medical treatment for
those who refuse vaccines. I am never completely serious, but it is
frustrating to see the dichotomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue I have with this article is one that I’ve written on before
&lt;a href="http://bblais.blogspot.com/2011/02/why-i-can-support-darwin-day-resolution.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://bblais.blogspot.com/2009/12/climate-change-denial-is-not-same-as.html"&gt;more here&lt;/a&gt;: he focusses on the comparison between
evolution denial and climate denial. It really drives me nuts! I am not
entirely convinced by the climate data that the situation is as dire as
is claimed. I am not sure whether the climate scientists have provided a
clear enough picture, without distortion, cherry-picking, and
exaggeration. I don’t have to deny all of physics, chemistry, and
biology to hold this position as creationists have to do. Perhaps I’m
what is sometimes called a luke-warmist, but even on its best days
climate science is nowhere close to as well supported as evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough! Stop comparing global warming deniers to evolution deniers. It’s
a bad comparison, and extremely misleading.&lt;/p&gt;

be a bit more active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone recently made a comment that they thought that …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My blog has been languishing for a bit, so I hope to bring it back and
be a bit more active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone recently made a comment that they thought that there was a lot
of “frivolous” research in science. They said “I don't really care how
big the universe is. I am not happier because of that knowledge. My life
is no better, nor my parents or my future children.[...] For me, in the
end I don't see how it benefits humanity. I would much rather see that
time and intellect spent on pursuing ways to improve global living
standards, protect the environment, create a better education system,
etc...”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several things I could say about this. People are notoriously
horrible at predicting which lines of intellectual pursuits will yield
real practical results (i.e. direct benefits to humanity). For example,
in the late 1800's there was some work done on some pretty obscure
mathematical concepts in wave mechanics. At the time there were very few
practical results foreseen from this work, if any. However, it later
became the foundation for telecommunications, which arguably makes up
the bulk of the global economy today. There are many examples like this.
That's why it's always good to have basic research funded well, even if
it seems frivolous at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowledge matters, no matter what it is. Your example about how you
don't care how big the universe is, for instance. Let's look at a couple
of contrasting beliefs, and their consequences to things like protecting
the environment, something you state is important. Person A believes
that the world was created specifically for humans, 6000 years ago, and
that this creator is making sure things are going along well for his
followers (i.e. granting miracles, giving guidance, etc...) Person B
believes that the Jesus is going to come again in this lifetime, and the
world will end in glory. Person C knows how big the universe really is.
This means that person C realizes that 1) the Earth is a relatively
small place and 2) there isn't anywhere else we can go if things get
messed up here. Which person do you think would be most willing to make
difficult decisions to protect the environment for the next, say,
200-300 years?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are benefits to "frivolous" science. One benefit is in critical
thinking, no matter what the topic. Another benefit is the philosophical
placement of humans in the grander scheme of things. This can have
direct *practical* effects on humanity, and its future. On any topic,
truth beats untruth.&lt;/p&gt;

work. I just had an experience at a local flower show where I ran into a
vendor of the bracelets. He enthusiastically invited me to a
demonstration, exactly like the demos I’d seen before. He was even
cooperative when I asked to do the demonstration on him. When I
proceeded to knock him over while he was wearing the bracelet (he
claimed that I was pushing outward) and failed to knock him over when he
wasn’t (he claimed I was pushing inward), he didn’t look too happy. When
I pointed out that that was how it worked, he started trying to quote
studies, and I amiably walked away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not sure what the best thing to do with these people. I thought
about doing what Richard Saunders does, and wear 10 of them (buying them
in bulk) and handing them out with a demonstration. That might get me
thrown out. Someone suggested I contact the media, a month or so ahead
of time for the flower show, and get them to do an investigative piece.
Another thing I may do is, if they are willing, is to suggest a very
simple blinded experiments. The nice thing about the balance bracelets
is that they claim some very simple, reproducible effects. As a result,
it is pretty easy to test it in the confines of a vendor booth at a
flower show. I will need to come prepared with two identical little
bags, and a fake bracelet, in order to do the test. Also, if they claim
improved balance, it’d be nice to have a balance test where the the
seller is not involved...something like a balance beam, perhaps. I feel
confident that I can be a real pain, yet not involve lawyers, in a case
like this.&lt;/p&gt;

don’t get our morality from scripture. I am not sure that many religious
people, even biblical literalists, would defend such a claim...so in a
way it really is a strawman. Francis Collins, following CS Lewis, place
morality front and center in their justification for their belief in
God, but at no time do they say that it comes &lt;em&gt;from scripture&lt;/em&gt;. They
claim that morality is, in essence, programmed into us as a gift from
the divine creator. The universality of altruism is used in an argument
from Collins for a behavior that cannot be selected for, and is thus an
indication of a supernatural, moral creator. He never once says that the
morality comes from scripture. Seen in this way, then scripture forms a
guide which may need to be interpreted for the changing times, even if
you are a literalist. I think it would be wiser for the new atheists to
ask if scripture can even be a good &lt;em&gt;guide&lt;/em&gt; for behavior, without
hammering the (strawman) point that scripture is not the &lt;em&gt;source&lt;/em&gt; of
morality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps they should poll their audience on the question of where they
believe morality comes from. If a significant fraction states that it
comes from scripture, then it no longer is a strawman. I just don’t
think it would come out that way.&lt;/p&gt;

the visible universe around 100 billion. It is worth pausing and

the major religions. Just trying to &lt;em&gt;imagine&lt;/em&gt; our place in this
vastness, and to imagine that there are other beings out there doing the
same thing, wondering if they are alone, there is a sense of awe and
wonder that is difficult to describe. Try it sometime: try to grasp,
even for a few seconds, what billions of billions of worlds would be
like, spread across a space that takes millions of years for light to
cross when light can circle the earth in (literally) the snap of a
finger.&lt;/p&gt;

classes, and have a decent (but not expert) understanding of the physics
involved. Among my colleagues I’m the only one who even entertains the
notion that the problem may not be as serious as the media suggests, and
I’m the only one who criticizes the IPCC and the “hide the decline” and
the extinct polar bears claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it was refreshing to hear &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbR0EPWgkEI"&gt;this talk&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_A._Muller"&gt;Prof Richard Muller&lt;/a&gt; at
Berkeley, and to see the &lt;a href="http://www.berkeleyearth.org/"&gt;Berkeley Earth Project&lt;/a&gt; start up. It’s seems
to be a reasonable look at what we know confidently, what we really
don’t know, and many of the communications failures in the recent years
between the climate experts and the public. I was pointed to this talk
by &lt;a href="http://judithcurry.com/"&gt;Dr Judith Curry’s website&lt;/a&gt;, which also seems to be a breath of
fresh air on this whole topic. It seems serious and scientific. It
doesn’t resort to the hysteria of Al Gore or of Sarah Palin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m looking forward to following these groups more closely in the
future.&lt;/p&gt;

says “Watson doesn't really ‘think’ anything, and it struggles with
simple questions that most humans can answer without a second thought.”
They continue, “a question like ‘If a snowman melts and later refreezes,
does it turn back into a snowman?’ would be nearly impossible for a
statistical reasoning program to tackle.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/13.7/2011/02/18/133853619/ibm-s-watson-a-hard-case"&gt;article on NPR&lt;/a&gt; compares Watson to a plant. “Watson,
biologically speaking, if you get my drift, is a plant. Watson is big
and it is rooted. Like all plants, it is deaf, blind, and immobile; it
is basically incapable of directing action of any kind on the world
around it.” Continuing, “Giving a plant a camera won't make it see, and
giving it language won't let it think. Which is just a way of reminding
us that Watson understands no language. Unlike the ant, who acts as
though it has reasons for its actions, Watson acts like a plant that
talks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think both authors are pretty glib at stating that Watson doesn’t
think like us. I am not entirely convinced. When Deep Blue defeated
Kasparov in chess, it was stated that Deep Blue doesn’t play chess like
a person plays chess. This is true. Deep Blue simply tries all of the
possibilities, good, bad, and stupid. Chess masters don’t even &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; bad
moves. Watson is another matter. Sure it compares the words in the
question to a big database, but it is doing probabilistic reasoning at
its core. This is exactly what people do. So Watson can’t handle very
abstract questions, like the concept of melting snowmen, but could a
child who has never experienced snow make this leap? We make this leap
because we’ve been presented, throughout our life, with a regular
universe and our brain has made an internal model of that universe.
Watson, too, has an internal model for its universe but the difference
is that Watson’s universe is sensory impoverished and conceptually
limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watson certainly cannot think as well as we humans, but that is a
limitation more of its hardware and the training environment that it is
in. But in many ways, Watson thinks just like us.&lt;/p&gt;

imagine how we developed our complexity through random chance” and
similar things, referring (incorrectly) to the “random” process of
evolution. This is a strawman argument that is put forward: either total
random chance or God. Creationists often do this, but it is also done on
the other side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take, for example, a recent post I saw on Facebook from one of my
friends:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...poses a direct challenge to all creationists. Provide an
explanation for vestigial features of living organisms without
inadvertently proving evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was surprised to learn that Answers in Genesis, the go-to place for
all things creationist, had a position on &lt;a href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/articles/aid/v3/n1/setting-record-straight-vestigial"&gt;vestigial features&lt;/a&gt;. That
description made use of arguments from molecular biology, and so-called
microevolution. It seems as if it is a common misunderstanding that
creationists reject all of the apparatus of evolution and microbiology,
and a simple, strawman statements like “creationists reject evolution”
don’t hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It really does help to look at the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt;arguments from each side, to
really see the limits of the analysis. Going back and forth between
&lt;a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/"&gt;Talk Origins&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/"&gt;Answers in Genesis&lt;/a&gt; is a good way to explore the
arguments. For example, in transitional fossils we &lt;a href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/get-answers#/topic/fossils"&gt;look in Answers in
Genesis&lt;/a&gt; and find articles like &lt;a href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/creation/v14/i4/fossils.asp"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/creation/v15/i3/missinglink.asp"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; which
steep of arguments from authority, claims without evidence, and
cherry-picking. Many of the arguments rest on criticizing small details
on a small number of fossils. In the &lt;a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-transitional.html"&gt;talk origins article on
transitional fossils&lt;/a&gt;, we get a very detailed, and seemingly complete,
list of transitions from all major animal types. It comes in many parts,
and details the characteristics on each transition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try it yourself! Pick a topic, go through and find the best arguments
each has. It’s a very good exercise. Throw in a good dash of the
&lt;a href="http://www.positiveatheism.org/writ/saganbd.htm"&gt;baloney detection kit&lt;/a&gt;, and you’re on your way.&lt;/p&gt;

parade, poo-pooing cherished beliefs and activities from acupuncture,
religion, ufo’s, and homeopathy. Where is the wonder, the joy? I’ve had
someone, after a particular session debunking UFO shows on the history
channel, say “But wouldn’t it be great if they were true?” Yes! But I
don’t want to give up intellectual honesty for wishful thinking. If it’s
true, that’s great, but I won’t reduce my efforts to debunk it just
because I’d love it to be true. In fact, wanting it to be true motivates
me even more to be skeptical, knowing that I’ll be less critical of
something I want to be true (as most humans are).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s at least one piece of wonder in the Universe. See the Earth in
this picture?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![newrings_cassini-2011-02-18-10-17.jpg][]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a picture of Saturn, with the Sun behind it, taken from the
Cassini spacecraft. See that little white speck in the rings, in the
upper left? That’s the Earth! There are two responses I have when seeing
this picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​1) We’re really small and insignificant in this Universe&lt;br&gt;
2) What an amazing thing that we can create something on the Earth, send
it a billion miles, and be able to take a picture of ourselves. That’s
amazing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The universe is amazing, both in its magnitude and complexity, and we
should feel a sense of awe. All this, without introducing unnecessary
constructs such as deities. Although science is often accused of
arrogance, I can think of no humbler activity than that which brought us
the picture above.&lt;/p&gt;

I had been agnostic before, and then made a decision that it was no
longer a tenable position to hold, and that the atheist label was the
one that matched my mindset best. Since I became an atheist 20 years
ago, I never once regretted the decision. There hasn’t been anything at
all that has moved me from that perspective, until this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen the light, and I’ve realized that in some ways it was the
wrong decision to become an atheist. I think it was what I needed at the
time, and now it is not. I even changed my Facebook profile!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what changed my mind? Sam Harris did, in his &lt;a href="http://www.samharris.org/site/full_text/aai-lecture-the-problem-with-atheism/"&gt;lecture on the
“Problem with Atheism”.&lt;/a&gt; Essentially, it boils down to the fact that
we don’t need a word for not believing in something, and that to attach
a charged word to it undermines the position. We don’t need, as he says,
a name for “non-astrologer”. We just need to espouse the positive
virtues of believing with sufficient evidence, for the quantification of
uncertainty, of intellectual honesty and consistency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in an effort to be more positive about my beliefs in evidence,
rationality, and science, from now on I am not going to consider myself
an atheist. If someone asks me if I believe in God, I will say I don’t
believe in Zeus, Thor or Yahweh (or any of the other gods we’ve heaped
on that pile we call mythology). If asked what religion I am, I’ll just
say “None”.&lt;/p&gt;

perhaps, a symbol of uniquely human activity: Jeopardy! The system,
Watson, is &lt;a href="http://www.j-archive.com/showgame.php?game_id=3576"&gt;doing quite well&lt;/a&gt; against the humans. The number of
applications for this technology is nearly endless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d wonder how this success will play into the broader discourse on the
human intellect, and our view of ourselves on the universe. When &lt;a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/deepblue/home/html/b.shtml"&gt;Deep
Blue defeated Kasparov&lt;/a&gt;, and the computer became (unofficially) the
world chess champion, I remember having mixed feelings. We like our
icons, I suppose, and hate to get rid of them. It’s like growing up, and
losing Santa Claus, perhaps. The history of science has been to deflate
human arrogance, and yet successes like Deep Blue and Watson are not
quite the same because it is our own ingenuity which created them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On some level, Watson &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; like a different accomplishment than Deep
Blue. Chess is deterministic, well formulated, and complex. It’s
complexity is the only thing that challenges an easy computer solution,
which was accomplished finally by brute force: get enough fast hardware
attacking a well-described problem and you win....always. Watson isn’t
nearly as well defined as chess, or at least it doesn’t &lt;em&gt;appear&lt;/em&gt; to be
as well defined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXH7jn2AHAw&amp;amp;feature=mfu_in_order&amp;amp;list=UL"&gt;Watching Watson&lt;/a&gt;, there is a creepy sort of feeling, probably due to
too many evil AI movies (2001, Terminator, Matrix, etc...). Kids growing
up today will have this sort of technology as the norm. All-in-all, an
interesting series of events to keep watching!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the look of shock on David’s face right after the “tides go in,
tides go out, never a miscommunication. You can’t explain that.”. I
think, however, David is completely ineffectual at conveying his point
and looks like a jerk. As a followup, Bill responds to a letter in this
video:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyHzhtARf8M"&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyHzhtARf8M&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here he concedes that the Moon causes the tides, but then adds a number
of other questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where did the Moon come from?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where did the Sun come from?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is order in the universe. Where did we, in all of our
    intricacies come from?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why life on this planet and not on the other planets?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He states that, given this observed order in the universe, that it takes
more faith to believe this was all luck, rather than in God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although many scientists would laugh at these questions, that is the
wrong response. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;These are reasonable questions!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; They are ignorant
and (because Bill should have done a bit of research before asking
them), uninformed questions but they are reasonable first-questions one
asks. If one is honest about getting answers (which I don’t think Bill
is), there are ready answers to these direct questions but it seems to
me that the intent of the questions is a bit different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First he says we can’t explain the tides. So we explain the tides, with
gravity and the Moon. Then he asks “where did the Moon come from?” He
could have just as easily asked “where did gravity come from?”. It is
clear from this line of questioning that there will never be a final
answer to satisfy him. Each time we answer one, there will be concepts
that that one builds on, etc...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is classic &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_the_gaps"&gt;God-of-the-Gaps&lt;/a&gt;, but it is something that I think
needs to be dealt with in a more subtle way than David Silverman and
many other atheists seem to do. I think most people, rightly, have a
sense of wonder about the amazing order in the universe. I think most
people immediately attach this order to a creator, the nearest cultural
deity, because they don’t have any alternative: they are not informed.
In order to dissuade them, I don’t think that insulting their deity is
effective because they take that as insulting their sense of wonder, and
then science seems like a sterile, arrogant, unimaginative bully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to find a way to enhance their sense of wonder, and yet
dismantle the notion that this requires some external deity. We need to
keep the spirituality, as a secular notion espoused by Carl Sagan, Sam
Harris and others, because that is what is really driving the issues for
most people and we need to push the use of the deity farther and farther
away from daily life. Science has to be seen as a creative endeavor, one
which fully respects the wonder and awe we all see and feel as we ponder
the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expressing support for designation of February 12, 2011, as …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I received a &lt;a href="http://www.project-reason.org/newsfeed/item/support_the_darwin_day_resolution_in_congress"&gt;tweet asking for support for the Darwin Day
Resolution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full text of the resolution is here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expressing support for designation of February 12, 2011, as Darwin Day
and recognizing the importance of science in the betterment of
humanity.&lt;br&gt;
Whereas Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution by the mechanism of
natural selection, together with the monumental amount of scientific
evidence he compiled to support it, provides humanity with a logical
and intellectually compelling explanation for the diversity of life on
Earth;&lt;br&gt;
Whereas the validity of Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural
selection is further strongly supported by the modern understanding of
the science of genetics;&lt;br&gt;
Whereas it has been the human curiosity and ingenuity exemplified by
Darwin that has promoted new scientific discoveries that have helped
humanity solve many problems and improve living conditions;&lt;br&gt;
Whereas the advancement of science must be protected from those
unconcerned with the adverse impacts of global warming and climate
change;&lt;br&gt;
Whereas the teaching of creationism in some public schools compromises
the scientific and academic integrity of the United States’ education
systems;&lt;br&gt;
Whereas Charles Darwin is a worthy symbol of scientific advancement on
which to focus and around which to build a global celebration of
science and humanity intended to promote a common bond among all of
Earth’s peoples; and&lt;br&gt;
Whereas, February 12, 2011, is the anniversary of the birth of Charles
Darwin in 1809 and would be an appropriate date to designate as Darwin
Day: Now, therefore, be it&lt;br&gt;
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—&lt;br&gt;
(1) supports the designation of Darwin Day; and&lt;br&gt;
(2) recognizes Charles Darwin as a worthy symbol on which to celebrate
the achievements of reason, science, and the advancement of human
knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was reading it with some interest, but then I get to the part about
“the adverse impacts of global warming and climate change”. Why is
climate change in there? There are so many obvious, uncontroversial
topics directly related to evolution in medicine, pharmaceuticals,
ecology, physiology, etc... that it seems to be both irrelevant and
counterproductive to include it. Sure, the climate change folks think
that denying it is like denying the holocaust or denying evolution, but
it really isn’t nearly at that level. There are not the number of
independent investigations and data supporting man-influenced climate
change as there are for either evolution or the holocaust, even if the
science were completely unambiguous on the topic (which it isn’t). To
conflate the two is a serious tactical mistake, and a serious scientific
mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I support Darwin Day, I can’t support this resolution because
of this ridiculous add-on.&lt;/p&gt;

method that Eratosthenes&lt;/a&gt; used to calculate the circumference of the
Earth. He stated that, on a flat Earth, with the light from a far-away
object like the Sun all shadows would be the same length. Seeing
different-length shadows, as Eratosthenes did in his famous Summer
Solstice observation, allows you to infer curvature. But the big
assumption here is that the light is coming from very far away. If we
had a flat Earth, it is easy to set up a situation where the Sun,
directly overhead in some place, casts a 7 degree angle 800 km away as
Eratosthenes observed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Untitled-2011-02-11-11-52.png" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_VLTJPGH7Stw/TVVuG09A25I/AAAAAAAAIbE/SdwPrven2eQ/Untitled-2011-02-11-11-52.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This simple arrangement results in a distance to the Sun of about 6500
km. The world is flat!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we have two different explanations of the observations. How do we
distinguish between them? Answer: the way it is always done in science -
spin out the consequences of each, and make predictions where they
disagree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is easy to show that continuing this calculation would result in some
striking predictions. First, given this distance, and the fact that
shadows change over the day, the apparent size of the Sun would be very
different from one location and another...and it is never observed to be
different, even across years. This suggests a very distant Sun. Further,
you’d have to make sure that the Moon was closer than the Sun (inferred
from eclipses) in both models. Once you do this, then you have &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt;
objects with the apparent size problem in the flat-Earth model, again
not supported by observation. There are probably many other predictions
this model makes which could easily have been verified by the ancients,
so it is no surprise that they did not consider it in their
calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is useful, however, to think about the consequences of models beyond
the data they agree with.&lt;/p&gt;

a problem, and then proposed a lousy solution to it. The problem she was
addressing had to do with the public perception of evolution as
something quite uncertain scientifically (“theory vs fact”). She
observed that the public sees science changing its stance on many
things, especially in medicine. One day, you should eat bran. The next,
bran is bad for you. The next, bran is good for you again. As a result
the public observes that &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; sciences are uncertain, and can’t
distinguish one field from another or one type of claim from another, so
they apply doubt to &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of science even when it is not warranted by
the science. Her solution involves using religious analogies,
interpreting phrases in the Bible to explain things like natural
selection and mutations, in order to communicate it to a group of people
who share and value that vocabulary. Dawkins rightly chews her out for
this approach, pointing out how far she is stretching the meaning of the
phrases just to fit her philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem she is stating, however, is quite real. How can we expect
the public to make decisions about medicine, global warming, evolution,
the big bang, etc... when they (somewhat rightly, somewhat wrongly)
observe that the scientists themselves are arguing about it? The
Intelligent Design folks are currently using this observation to sow
doubt with the public in their efforts to “teach the controversy” of
evolution to inject creationism into the schools. It is a failure of the
scientists, and the media that covers them, to communicate with the
public. Can we do better?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a proposal, which I’ll sketch out in a toy example. The problem
is not the communication of facts, or even of the procedures of science.
The problem is with the communication of &lt;em&gt;uncertainties&lt;/em&gt;. In day to day
life, we easily handle claims with different levels of uncertainties.
The sun rises in the east each morning has low uncertainty. The claims
of the auto salesman or the politician have higher uncertainty.
Quantifying it is, of course, more challenging but the qualitative
features of uncertainty are known to nearly everyone. So scientists and
journalists really need to take efforts to communicate the uncertainty
of every claim, not just the fact of the claim or how the new
observations differ from the old observations. How could this be done? I
think, at least roughly, one should include a plot of the probability
distribution with any claim. One doesn’t need to know advanced math to
see the picture. If every claim is accompanied by a plot of the
uncertainties, the public will get used to reading them. Let me
demonstrate with a toy example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say, I am trying to determine the origin year of homo sapiens. I realize
there isn’t just one year, and there is a process, but it is not much
harder to include those in this simple analysis. I have several homo
sapiens fossils where I’ve measured the age, which allows me to
calculate my best guess of the age, and the distribution of my
uncertainty shown here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="blah2-2011-01-29-11-35.png" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_VLTJPGH7Stw/TURPTliAviI/AAAAAAAAIa4/CfFYIxijoUw/blah2-2011-01-29-11-35.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve used a normal, Gaussian, distribution here although in fact it
probably should be something skewed left and probably a lot flatter to
reflect our greater uncertainty with age, and that we have other
observations that put confident lower limits on the origin of homo
sapiens. Again, the details aren’t important because all attempts at
clarifying the distribution only further help with communicating the
uncertainty to the public. A few observations are in order here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there are many possible values for the origin that lie well outside
    of our data yet have non-zero probability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our “best guess” is around the middle of this distribution, but it
    really can’t be interpreted as “homo sapiens originated 250,000
    years ago” as it might read in a newspaper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we have a new paper that adds another fossil much older than than
the previous ones, around 340000 years ago. Newspapers may claim “origin
of homo sapiens 150% older than originally thought”, or “estimates of
the origin of humans overthrown by new data”. How might it look with the
uncertainties plotted?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="blah3-2011-01-29-11-35.png" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_VLTJPGH7Stw/TURPUQuuLWI/AAAAAAAAIa8/Aw9Zwx60JR4/blah3-2011-01-29-11-35.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of lessons that can be read from this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the new data updates our “best estimate” by only a little - the old
    data, combined with the new data, are used for the estimate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;our uncertainties have widened - by having a larger range of data,
    our uncertainties may have increased with new data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, estimating an origin (first event) will update a bit
differently than this example shows. For example, the uncertainties in
the right-half of the distribution may not be affected at all by an
older observation. If this data were in medicine, however, and we were
estimating the effect of some new treatment, then the update would be
very similar. A single result of a strong effect may not increase our
best estimate for that effect by a huge amount. The uncertainties in
many medical treatments, or dietary recommendations, straddle the
origin: there is significant probability for &lt;em&gt;no effect&lt;/em&gt;. It would be
fruitful to see the plot of uncertainties, pushed a little this way and
that, updated in perhaps a wiki style by scientists as new data come in.
There would be many lessons, all of which would help the public
understanding of science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;observations rarely overturn well-supported scientific understanding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not all topics have equal uncertainties - doubting everything the
    same amount is not rational&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;certainty is never an option, but sometimes the uncertainty is so
    low that there is a practical certainty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nature itself, not authority, determines our best guess and some of
    our uncertainty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the thing you are measuring has a small effect, then you should
    expect a series of measurements of the effect to change sign: bran
    is good, bran is bad, bran is good, etc.... This doesn’t mean that
    the scientists are waffling, it only means that the effect is small
    and difficult to detect - and probably meaningless.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the public could learn to, at least qualitatively, understand
and use plots like these. Perhaps there is a better way to display it
that does not do violence to the truth, and I’d be open to that. I think
getting in the habit of making plots like this would be good for the
scientist as well, forcing them to address and communicate the actual
uncertainties in their claims.&lt;/p&gt;

all of the harm it does, such as the suicide bombings, honor killings,
the Inquisition, etc... This includes the “New Atheists”, like Sam
Harris and Richard Dawkins. Others counter that this one-sided
perspective ignores all of the good that religion does, such as support
for people when they are ill, the donations to natural disaster funds,
etc... They argue that religion does more good than harm. This sort of
argument is used in economics, and is similar (although not identical
to) a cost-benefit analysis. One can focus on, for example, the harm
that cars bring in pollution and pavement like environmentalists do or
one can focus on the benefits of cars like the access to better health
care, the allowance of critical population densities to support
significant industries like the industry reps would do. An economist
would then weigh both sides, benefits minus costs, and see which to
prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to do this with religion one cannot simply take the good of
religion subtract the bad, come up with a positive number, and say that
religion is a benefit to society. It’s like saying that the treatment
for the measles is two aspirin and some juice resulting in more cases of
recovery than death and saying that we shouldn’t replace this treatment
with something else. As is turns out, for the measles, a vaccine will
prevent nearly all contractions of the disease, and virtually all
deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we replace religion with a rational perspective (as Sam Harris
proposes), which includes a respect for spiritual experiences but not
the supernatural explanations of them, then it may be that we
essentially vaccinate people against such behavior as suicide bombings,
honor killings and inquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;

bright people discuss the role of science and religion in society.  I

attached clip from the very end of &lt;a href="http://thesciencenetwork.org/programs/beyond-belief-science-religion-reason-and-survival/session-4-1"&gt;Session 4&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this 5-minute audio clip, &lt;a href="http://dmschreiber.ucsd.edu/"&gt;Darren Schreiber&lt;/a&gt;, UCSD Political
Science, make the point that science shows little humility.  He
continues to claim that his religion is what motivates him for humility,
to face the unknown with a humble, searching perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His comments are followed up by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Druyan"&gt;Ann Druyan&lt;/a&gt;, the wife of the late
Carl Sagan, in which she essentially says that science and its methods
promote the utmost humility.  We are not afforded absolute truths, and
if whatever knowledge that we are most confident in gets disproved then
science will give its highest honor to the person disproving it.  She
points out that science brings us out of a childish narcissism, a key
part of nearly all religions, which demands that we are central to the
universe.&lt;/p&gt;
