            <p><p>These two terms that I had never heard before came up when listening to
some Christian apologetic podcasts (specifically <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-pleaseconvinceme-apologetics/id259695657">Please Convince Me</a>
and <a href="http://www.str.org/podcast/weekly/rss.xml">Stand to Reason</a>). There seems to be some split between Christian
apologists on these two approaches to apology. What is interesting is
that the normal course of science uses both, so there really shouldn't
be any split for any rational approach to justification of the ideas.
Evidentialists argue for the exists of the Christian God through
outlining of the evidence of the Christian God, and then follow the
logical arguments that come from that. Presuppositionalists seem to
assume the existence of the Christian God, but then try demonstrate that
the world only makes sense if you do so.</p>
<p>In other words, they are "X is true and here is the evidence or logical
argument for X" and "if we assume X, then W, Y, and Z that we observe
make sense...otherwise W, Y, and Z do not make sense". Both of these are
done in science all the time. Take, Newton's law of gravitation for
example. When he proposed the form of the gravitational force, \$latex
{F \sim 1/r\^2}\$, Newton did not provide direct evidence for this
form...that was first done only <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavendish_experiment">100 years later by Cavendish</a>. What
he did is say was "<em>if</em> the form of the force is \$latex {F \sim
1/r\^2}\$, then many other things make sense (i.e. motion of the
planets, the tides, the falling of objects near the surface of the
Earth, etc...)". In a way, this is a presuppositionalist argument: if we
take X to be true, then our observations of W, Y, and Z make sense. This
type of argument is considered evidence in science, and is done all the
time. Really, the two ways that scientific theories can be justified
are:</p>
<ol>
<li>directly test the assumptions of the theory</li>
<li>spin out the consequences, and compare with observation</li>
</ol>
<p>The former is, what the apologists would call, evidentialist while the
latter is presuppositionalist. In a fit of irony, I have heard many
so-called refutations of atheists on the topic of morality of the form
"atheists claim there is no objective morality, so they can't even state
that the actions of the God in the Old Testament are evil". However, all
these atheists are doing are using a preuppositionalist argument: "If we
assume that God is good, and that the 'good' is defined by the
statements of Jesus and the ten commandments, then we can demonstrate
that the other acts of God in the Bible are evil."</p>
<p>Personally, I just like to lump both terms into "rational argument" and
leave it at that. They do little to shed light on the issues, and to me
they are a distinction without a difference.</p></p>
