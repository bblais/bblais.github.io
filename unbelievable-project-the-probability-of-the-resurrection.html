<li>
<p>Full Title: <em>The Probability of the Resurrection - Calum Miller &amp;
    Chris Hallquist - Unbelievable? - 06 July 2013 – Is the resurrection
    97% likley as Swinburne claims?</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Christian philosopher Richard Swinburne has used probability
theory to show that the likelihood of the resurrection of Christ
is 0.97.<br />
 Calum Miller is a Christian apologist and student of Swinburne.
He talks about why he believes that probability theory can be used
to show that the resurrection is highly likely to be true.<br />
 Chris Hallquist is an atheist blogger who argues that the
resurrection is not well supported by evidence or probability.<br />

<h4 id="notes">Notes</h4>
<p><strong>Me - I was really looking forward to this episode. What was not to
like? Probability theory, ancient religions, evidence for
Christianity…bring it on! Unfortunately, it really wasn’t that
impressive.</strong></p>
<p>Calum - <em>“There’s what’s called the confirmation of resurrection, the
explanatory power. And this is basically the idea that there is a lot of
evidence which, if the resurrection happened would be expected but if
the resurrection didn’t happen, it would be very improbable. And if this
is true, if there really is that kind of evidence, then it follows from
probability theory that our confidence in the resurrection should be
greatly increased by this evidence. [Concerning the prior], more
extraordinary or extreme events are more improbable to begin with, and
so you would need more evidence to confirm them. So a lot of the debate
about the resurrection comes down to the prior probability, whether we
think it is actually really improbable and that no possible evidence
could ever make us convinced of it. ”</em></p>
<p><strong>Me - He basically has the distinction between the following as the
basis for all of the “calculation”:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>evidence that, if it existed, would be very common if the
    resurrection <em>did</em> happen</strong></li>
<li><strong>evidence that, if it existed, would be very rare if the
    resurrection <em>didn’t</em> happen</strong></li>
<li><strong>the prior probability for the resurrection</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>where he admits that <em>"the debate about the resurrection comes down to
the prior probability</em>". Anyone doing probabilistic inference knows that
it should never come down primarily to your choice of priors. The data
needs to rise above the prior, and the prior needs to be an honest
-ideally objective- assessment of the pre-data probability assignments
or, often, the initial state of ignorance. By admitting this, Calum is
essentially saying either that:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>the data are not strong enough to constrain a diffuse prior, and
    thus is unconvincing or…</strong></li>
<li><strong>you have to come into the debate with a <em>sharp</em> prior which admits
    to a presupposition of the strength of the claim.</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Neither of these stances is convincing in the slightest.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Further, in response to this set up, he ignores the most important
thing in any Bayesian treatment is the set of models that you are using
to compare. You cannot simply test the truth of a single model in
isolation, nor is it generally informative to compare model A true or
false. Instead one wants to set up a list of models, hypotheses,
theories to explain the data and evaluate those multiple models. Instead
of,</strong></p>
<p>\<span class="math">\(latex  
P({\\rm resurrection}|{\\rm data})  
\\)</span><br />
and<br />
\<span class="math">\(latex  
P(\\mbox{not resurrection}|{\\rm data})  
\\)</span></p>
<p><strong>you’d want</strong></p>
<p>\<span class="math">\(latex  
P({\\rm resurrection}|{\\rm data}), P({\\rm hallucination}|{\\rm
data}), P({\\rm legend}|{\\rm data}), P({\\rm literary}|{\\rm data}),
P({\\rm hoax}|{\\rm data}),\\)</span> etc…<br />
<strong>where of course each of these models would have many details beyond
the simple label I’m putting in here. By being explicit with what you’re
comparing to, it is easier to see where the different prior
probabilities come in. Are you really going to suggest that someone
rising from the dead is on par, prior to the data, with a legendary
construction given how many legendary constructions we’ve seen and how
many dead rising we’ve <em>not</em> seen?</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is clear is that all of these other models must, a priori, be
more probable than rising from the dead <em>even if a God exists</em>. Just
because you believe miracles <em>could</em> happen does not mean that you
believe every miracle claim is true, and given the number of clearly
false miracle claims, the prior probability for any miracle claim must
be quite low - even if you believe miracles actually occur.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Another point about the data which Calum never deals with is that it
should include things we <em>don’t</em> see, not just things we do. If we
expect something to occur with a claim, and we don’t see it, that is in
fact evidence against the claim.</strong></p>
<p>Chris - Most Christians might discount the claim that the miracles
around African religions seem to disappear in the US and UK because of
lack of faith. Or perhaps the miracle stories around Mormonism. What
makes the miracles of Jesus different than these ones? Once you accept
the idea that resurrection claims can exist quite commonly in a group of
religiously charged people, it is no longer quite so hard to understand
the resurrection claims in the Bible.</p>
<p>Calum - The reports of an empty tomb are exactly what you’d expect if
the resurrection actually happened, and would be unlikely in the case of
a non-resurrection event.</p>
<p><strong>Me - Dealing with this is actually very simple. He is correct that <em>if
the resurrection occurred</em>, then the report of an empty tomb would very
likely be given, and I would add that it would also be very likely to be
reported in the earliest accounts we have of the resurrection. Is this
what we see? No! The empty tomb is not mentioned in Paul, neither are
the physical visitations, both of which you’d expect to see if the
Resurrection actually occurred. Even the visitations are not mentioned
in Mark! So, from a probabilistic point of view, this is the exact
opposite of what we’d expect to see if the resurrection actually
occurred. In fact the descriptions of the resurrection get more
elaborate and more physical the later the text (Paul has visions, Mark
has no visitations but the empty tomb, Matthew and Luke have
visitations, John has the doubting Thomas story, etc…). This is exactly
what we’d expect for legendary development, or a story that has been
embellished over time.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The other thing, is it really all that unlikely to have an empty tomb
story with no resurrection? Notice, I’m not saying to have an empty
tomb, but to have an empty tomb <em>story</em>. There are several different
routes to get that. One is as a literary device. I believe Richard
Carrier supports this, as a reference to Daniel. Another is a deliberate
counter to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docetism">Docetism</a>, to gain favor and win an argument.</strong></p>
<p>Calum - <em>“It is not necessarily helpful to have just some kind of
religious context, it must be the right kind of one. So, for example, I
can see very good reasons why God would want to vindicate Jesus’
teaching by resurrecting him because I think Jesus taught a lot of very
good things, I thought he was (obviously as a Christian) I think he was
a very sincere, a very good person. And I can think of a lot of good
reasons why God would choose Jesus to be a prophet and to become
incarnate in him. Whereas I don’t see comparably good reasons why God
would want to vindicate Mormon teaching. Obviously a lot of that is
because I don’t know a lot about Mormonism but there’s still the
asymmetry there.”</em></p>
<p>Chris - The positive evidence for Mormonism is a lot better than for
Christianity. We have signed documents by the early followers and
founders attesting to the miracles. The best we can say about Paul’s
evidence is that he had a vision. We have a lot of negative evidence for
Mormonism, to be sure, but if we knew more about Christianity perhaps
things would be different.</p>
<p><strong>Me - I would add that we have this <em>pro-Christian</em> filter for all of
our documents, a filter called the Middle Ages, where documents
supporting Christianity had a much better probability of surviving (i.e.
copied) than ones critical of Christianity. The only reason we have the
Nag Hammadi texts is that the monks refused to burn them, as ordered by
the Christian orthodoxy at the time, and instead chose to store them in
a cave. Think about that campaign of whitewashing for hundreds of years!
Actually, the fact that we have so little actual documentary support for
Christianity coming from the first century, despite this huge bias, to
me argues against Christianity.</strong></p>
<p>Chris- How do you know Jesus was sincere or not? Seems like the same
could be said for Joseph Smith.</p>
<h3 id="afterward-abitaboutpriors">Afterward - a bit about priors</h3>
<p>(this section is all <strong>Me -</strong>, so I won’t put it in bold.)</p>
<p>I don’t really think that when Calum is referring to priors that he
really means that in the same way as <em>before the data</em>. It seems to me,
and I believe Swinburne’s analysis reflects this, that the prior for
<em>this</em> calculation is really the posterior for a <em>previous</em> calculation
regarding the existence and properties of God. This is perfectly
legitimate Bayesian procedure, but it makes the argument a different
one. Because of this, <a href="http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/23553-the-resurrection-of-god-incarnate/">Swinburne’s calculation</a> for the probability of
God needs to be addressed before we can even deal with the priors in
this resurrection argument. That will have to be another post entirely,
but at any rate Calum did not do it a service in this debate, having not
really gotten to the meat of it when he could have.</p>
