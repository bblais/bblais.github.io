            <p class="tags">
</p>
            <p><p>The following link is a Bill O’Reilly interview with David Silverman,
President of American Atheists:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XEgkViLbTk&amp;t=1m40s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XEgkViLbTk&amp;t=1m40s</a></p>
<p>I love the look of shock on David’s face right after the “tides go in,
tides go out, never a miscommunication. You can’t explain that.”. I
think, however, David is completely ineffectual at conveying his point
and looks like a jerk. As a followup, Bill responds to a letter in this
video:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyHzhtARf8M">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyHzhtARf8M</a></p>
<p>Here he concedes that the Moon causes the tides, but then adds a number
of other questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Where did the Moon come from?</li>
<li>Where did the Sun come from?</li>
<li>There is order in the universe. Where did we, in all of our
    intricacies come from?</li>
<li>Why life on this planet and not on the other planets?</li>
</ol>
<p>He states that, given this observed order in the universe, that it takes
more faith to believe this was all luck, rather than in God.</p>
<p>Although many scientists would laugh at these questions, that is the
wrong response. <strong><em>These are reasonable questions!</em></strong> They are ignorant
and (because Bill should have done a bit of research before asking
them), uninformed questions but they are reasonable first-questions one
asks. If one is honest about getting answers (which I don’t think Bill
is), there are ready answers to these direct questions but it seems to
me that the intent of the questions is a bit different.</p>
<p>First he says we can’t explain the tides. So we explain the tides, with
gravity and the Moon. Then he asks “where did the Moon come from?” He
could have just as easily asked “where did gravity come from?”. It is
clear from this line of questioning that there will never be a final
answer to satisfy him. Each time we answer one, there will be concepts
that that one builds on, etc...</p>
<p>This is classic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_the_gaps">God-of-the-Gaps</a>, but it is something that I think
needs to be dealt with in a more subtle way than David Silverman and
many other atheists seem to do. I think most people, rightly, have a
sense of wonder about the amazing order in the universe. I think most
people immediately attach this order to a creator, the nearest cultural
deity, because they don’t have any alternative: they are not informed.
In order to dissuade them, I don’t think that insulting their deity is
effective because they take that as insulting their sense of wonder, and
then science seems like a sterile, arrogant, unimaginative bully.</p>
<p>We need to find a way to enhance their sense of wonder, and yet
dismantle the notion that this requires some external deity. We need to
keep the spirituality, as a secular notion espoused by Carl Sagan, Sam
Harris and others, because that is what is really driving the issues for
most people and we need to push the use of the deity farther and farther
away from daily life. Science has to be seen as a creative endeavor, one
which fully respects the wonder and awe we all see and feel as we ponder
the universe.</p>
