            <p><p>This post in response to a <a href="http://brianblais.wordpress.com/2013/12/01/a-story-of-humanity/#comments">comment I received about the source of
morality in society</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But I realize religion, even with its negatives, remains a net
positive in human endeavors because it supplies something that cannot
be supplied by any other…a body of moral precepts that humans can
rally around and use to guide behavior in society.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't believe this, and neither do most people if they thought about
it for a little while.  On a practical level, how do we figure out what
is good and what is bad?</p>
<p>Let's focus just on the Christian message, which is informed from the
moral statements in the Bible.  This includes things like the Golden
Rule, the Sermon on the Mount, and the Ten Commandments...or does it?
 Here are a few quotes from the Bible, both Old and New Testament, and I
ask which ones are good and bad, and how do you know?:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Deuteronomy 22:20-1 If, however, the charge is true and no proof of
the girl’s virginity can be found, she shall be brought to the door of
her father’s house and there the men of her town shall stone her to
death.</p>
<p>Deuteronomy 20: However, in the cities of the nations the Lord your
God is giving you as an inheritance, do not leave alive anything that
breathes.</p>
<p>Exodus 21:20-21 If a man beats his male or female slave with a rod and
the slave dies as a direct result, he must be punished, but he is not
to be punished if the slave gets up after a day or two, since the
slave is his property.</p>
<p>1 Peter 2:18 Slaves, submit yourselves to your masters with all
respect, not only to those who are good and considerate, but also to
those who are harsh.</p>
<p>Matthew 5: 31 “It has been said, ‘Anyone who divorces his wife must
give her a certificate of divorce.’  But I tell you that anyone who
divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, makes her the victim
of adultery, and anyone who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.</p>
<p>Leviticus 24:16 “And he that blasphemeth the name of the Lord, he
shall surely be put to death”  - penalty for breaking one of the ten
commandments</p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5;">Matthew 12:32 “Whosoever speaketh
against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this
world, neither in the world to come”. </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5;">Now, I am not making any claims here that
any of these are good or bad (although personally, I do have opinions on
them).  What I am saying is that people look at some of these and say
they are bad, some are just fine, but </span><em>whatever reason people
use, they aren't using the religion as the authority to
decide</em><span style="line-height:1.5;">.  That's the point.  People
already pick and choose messages from the Bible, taking some of the more
unpleasant things as anachronistic or metaphorical, other unpleasant
things as exaggerations, and keeping the seemingly good things.  </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5;">In all of this, the religion isn't the
thing giving them guidance in their moral decisions.  The religion is
simply giving a vocabulary to summarize the moral perspective someone
has for non-religious reasons, in much the same way that the
</span><a href="http://www.bartleby.com/119/1.html">Robert Frost poem "The Road Not
Taken"</a><span style="line-height:1.5;"> summarizes the feeling many
have of being better choosing a more difficult path in life.  However,
we come to that feeling for "non-Frostian" reasons.  It could even be
said that for some, reading the Frost poem motivates them to see value
in a difficult decision.  However, there is something "non-Frostian"
motivating the decision to draw inspiration from this poem, and not
another one.</span></p>
<p>We can take our moral messages from many sources, and in practice we do
that.  Although many people claim that religion gives us our morality,
or moral guidance, in reality it does nothing of the sort.</p></p>
