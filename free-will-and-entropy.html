            <p><p>In Sam Harris’ <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=pCofmZlC72g">talk on free will</a>, we have the following comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“if we caught a serial killer, we’d assume his responsibility because
of his ability to have chosen otherwise. if we then discovered that he
had a brain tumor which we could determine resulted in homicidal
behavior, we’d determine that he was not responsible - that he was a
victim of biology. this, however, is just a special case of any
biological brain state - if we could know for certain how brain states
generated behavior, we would just as certainly determine that he was
not responsible for his actions and is just a victim of biology”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have two parts of knowledge needed here: know for certain the current
state and how (in detail) that state progresses to the macroscopic
outcomes. From this we have a sort of determinism that is inconsistent
with a simple notion of “free will”.</p>
<p>Now, I happened to be teaching the concept of entropy in my physics
class at the same time I watched this, and I was struck by the parallel.
I had thought of this before, last year, but never wrote about it. The
concept of entropy arises when we don’t know the details of every single
molecule in a system, knowing only some gross average features like the
average energy or pressure. If we knew the current state of the system
perfectly, and knew the laws of physics to forecast from that state,
then we’d be able to reverse any process. However, given our lack of
knowledge, the system moves in the single direction of increasing
entropy, where the the energy is spread out the most, and the system has
access to the most number of micro states consistent with the macro
states we actually measure. The system is described in a
non-deterministic way, even if all of the laws of physics underlying the
motion of the molecules is entirely deterministic.</p>
<p>Perhaps our feeling of “free will” is real, in the same sense that
entropy is real - it’s a non-deterministic description despite the
underlying deterministic processes, arising from our practical lack of
knowledge of the perfect details of those underlying processes. This
idea needs more fleshing out, but it seems to be an interesting
perspective to me.</p></p>
