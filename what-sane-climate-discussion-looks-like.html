<p>One of the standard climate blogs I read is <a href="http://judithcurry.com/">Judith Curry's blog Climate Etc...</a>  I find that the topics she brings up, and the points she adds to it, are always very engaging and even-handed, without the usual alarmism.  For example, here is a <a href="http://judithcurry.com/2014/07/30/lomborgs-senate-testimony/">summary of Bjorn Lomborg's Senate testimony</a>, all points perfectly reasonable, as far as I can see.</p>
<p>From his estimates, "The cost of inaction by the end of the century is equivalent to an annual loss of GDP growth on the order of 0.02%....equivalent to losing one year’s growth, or a moderate, one year recession." while "policy action as opposed to inaction, also has costs, and will still incur a significant part of the climate damage." and incur (optimistically) a cost of "1.5% of GDP by the end of the century." </p>
<p>Further, he addresses certain specific policies, like</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Solar   and   wind   power   was   subsidized   by   \$60   billion   in   2012,<br />
despite   their     paltry   climate   benefit   of   \$1.4   billion. <br />
Essentially,   $58.6   billion   were   wasted.   Depending   on   political <br />
viewpoint,   that   money   could   have   been   used   to   get   better <br />
health   care,   more   teachers,   better   roads,   or   lower   taxes. <br />
Moreover, forcing   everyone   to   buy   more   expensive,   less   reliable <br />
energy   pushes   higher   costs   throughout   the   economy,   leaving   less <br />
for   welfare.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I find, nearly universally, that people who espouse strong environmental policies never look at the <em>benefits</em> of <em>not doing</em> those policies - they focus entirely on one side of the economics.  </p>
<p>Finally, I like the metaphor that he brought in</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The   metaphor   here   is   the   computer   in   the   1950s.   We   did <br />
not   obtain   better   computers   by   mass producing   them   to   get <br />
cheaper   vacuum   tubes.   We   did   not   provide   heavy   subsidies   so <br />
that   every   Westerner   could   have   one   in   their   home   in   1960. <br />
Nor   did   we   tax   alternatives   like   typewriters.   The   breakthroughs <br />
were   achieved   by   a   dramatic   ramping   up   of   R&amp;D,   leading   to <br />
multiple   innovations,   which   enabled   companies   like   IBM   and <br />
Apple   to   eventually   produce   computers   that   consumers   wanted   to <br />
buy.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This seems to me to be a rational way to discuss these topics.</p></p>
