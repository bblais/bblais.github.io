<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>My responses in <strong>bold</strong>, quotes in <em>italic</em>, and the rest is a
    paraphrase. I may change this formatting convention as I go through
    the project in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>Duncan - <em>"hard to be an atheist - people are shocked when they hear"</em>.
<em>"Primarily belief based on indoctrination at an early age rather than
at an age when you can make decisions for yourself."</em></p>
<p>Paul - <em>"saying you're a Christian, as opposed to Muslim or Hindu, you
get the same sort of reaction."</em></p>
<p>Question to Duncan - <em>"why would we be better off without belief in
God?"</em></p>
<p>Justin - <em>"Do you feel that you've lost something? Does it make one sad
that this is all we have?"</em></p>
<p>Duncan - As a race, why are we better off? Middle East, Ireland, obvious
issues. Asking people to pray when they could be doing something
themselves. You can, as an atheist, investigate any other truth claims.</p>
<p>Paul - the Christian is allowed to investigate anything. <em>"atheism is an
absolute truth claim just as the faith claims."</em> Stalin and Mao
connected to their atheism?</p>
<p><strong>Me - What is clear is that dogmatic thinking, whether religious or
atheistic, leads to suffering. however, religion by its very structure
celebrates dogmatism, whereas modern scientific (i.e. skeptical)
thinking abhors it wherever it is seen.</strong></p>
<p>Paul - <em>"what hitler did was not in accord of Christian beliefs"</em></p>
<p><strong>Me - The bible is a multiple-choice text. You can find anything in it,
so it can be used to justify the worst behavior and the best behavior.</strong></p>
<p>Paul - <em>"the 20th century was an experiment in secularism, and the
result was secular evil more virulent than what came before."</em></p>
<p>Paul - people take belief systems and use them for evil. Christianity is
not inherently evil. there is evil in the human heart. the problem is
with selfish people who might come along and use christianity or any
other belief systems for there end.</p>
<p>Duncan - human beings will do evil.</p>
<p>Paul - why haven't we evolved out of that?</p>
<p><strong>Me - even asking this question shows a remarkable ignorance about how
evolution works. first, we are effectively the same humans now (from an
evolution standpoint) as we were when we left africa. so why would we
expect to have <em>"evolved out of that?"</em> second, it is clear that a
<em>balance</em> of selfish tendencies and societal, non-selfish, tendencies
leads to success in social creatures like us. therefore, we are still
stuck with those selfish tendencies. I am not convinced that if we were
able to eliminate this, that this would necessarily be a good thing
overall. it could be that this selfish, competitive, aspect gives us the
motivation to find creative solutions to problems about which we might
otherwise be complacent.</strong></p>
<p>Paul - second hand belief and disbelief, from parents, community, needs
to be scrutinized and figured out yourself.</p>
<p>Paul - atheism has no objective way of determining right from wrong.</p>
<p>Duncan - God supposedly created everything, absolutely everything, knows
us, and what we are going to do and yet there are people starving that
he could have saved. He must be in control of these things but I have
not seen any answers out there from Christianity for <em>"why the evil, why
at all?"</em></p>
<p>Paul - agrees that God knows these things, and that the evil is allowed
to happen for a reason. In man-made evil, is not directly caused by God
(because of free will). on natural evil, he asks <em>"do you think there is
enough food in the world to feed everyone in the world?"</em></p>
<p><strong>Me - absolutely yes. it's just not distributed properly. and that
doesn't get God off the hook, because he could easily make the soil more
fertile, etc... in the places without enough food currently.</strong></p>
<p>Duncan - if people prayed a little less and do a little more, then
things would be improved.</p>
<p>Paul - you can pray and do, as well.</p>
<p>Duncan - prayer is a waste of time.</p>
<p>Paul - prayer is the sort of activity that makes yourself more into the
type of person that could help. if prayer is a waste of time, do you do
anything that wastes time? Certainly you could do more.</p>
<p>Paul - is there ever a justification for allowing suffering? yes, like a
nurse giving a shot, to allow for a higher goal. so, is there a higher
goal, to justify the suffering? if there were one, then it would have to
be pretty big and pretty important. the christian answer to it is the
higher goal in question is the glory of god. somehow, all of these
things work together for the glory of god.</p>
<p>Duncan - maybe my brain is not wired right, but I don't see how people
dying people for the glory of god, even if they do not believe or ever
heard of <em>"your god"</em>.</p>
<p>Paul - we are seeing the back of the tapestry, not the front. the messy
side.</p>
<p>Paul - to strictly be an atheist and to make the absolute truth claim
that there is nowhere anywhere in the universe a god you need complete
knowledge and ethical perfection.</p>
<p><strong>Me - what a ridiculous straw man. replace <em>"God"</em> in this sentence
with <em>"Fairy"</em> or <em>"Unicorn"</em> or <em>"Zeus"</em> and you'll immediately see
why.</strong></p>
<p>Justin - what about the positive impact, when they found christ.</p>
<p>Duncan - what about the positive impact of atheism?</p>
<p><strong>Me - is there anything that you believe in, strongly, for which the
<em>only</em> evidence you have are stories in ancient texts?</strong></p>
