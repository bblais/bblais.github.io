N, Blais, B.S. Energy consumption and entropy production in a stochastic formulation of BCM learning. Journal of Computational Biology Volume 28, Number 0 (2021) 1–12 In a series of previous studies, we provided a stochastic description of a theory of synaptic plasticity. This theory, called BCM from the names of the three authors, has been formulated in two ways: the original formulation, where the plasticity threshold is defined as the square of the time-averaged neuronal activity, and a newer formulation, where the plasticity threshold is defined as the time average of the square of the neuronal activity. The newest formulation of the BCM rule of synaptic activity has interesting statistical properties, derived from a risk (or energy) function, the minimization of which leads to seeking of interesting projections in high-dimensional space. Moreover, these two rules, if implemented by a chemical master equation approach, show another interesting difference: the original rule satisfies the detailed balance, whereas the other not. Based on this different behavior, we found a continuous parameterization between these two rules. This parameterization shows a minimum that corresponds to maximum negative eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix. In addition, the newest rule, due to the fact that it is in a nonequilibrium steady state (NESS), shows a higher level of plasticity than the original rule. This higher level of plasticity has to be interpreted in the framework of open thermodynamical systems and we show that entropy production and energy consumption in the newest rule are both less than in the original BCM rule. 2020 Caitlyn R.Witkowski, Marcel T.J. van der Meer, Brian Blais, Jaap S.Sinninghe Damstéad, Stefan Schouten. Algal biomarkers as a proxy for pCO \\(_2\\) : Constraints from late Quaternary sapropels in the eastern Mediterranean . Organic Geochemistry. Volume 150, December 2020. Records of carbon dioxide concentrations (partial pressure expressed as pCO \\(_2\\) ) over Earth's history provide trends that are critical to understand our changing world. To better constrain pCO \\(_2\\) estimations, here we test organic pCO \\(_2\\) proxies against the direct measurements of pCO \\(_2\\) recorded in ice cores. Based on the concept of stable carbon isotopic fractionation due to photosynthetic CO \\(_2\\) fixation (Ɛp), we use the stable carbon isotopic composition (δ \\(&#94;{13}\\) C) of the recently proposed biomarker phytol (from all photoautotrophs), as well as the conventionally used alkenone biomarkers (from specific species) for comparison, to reconstruct pCO \\(_2\\) over several Quaternary sapropel formation periods (S1, S3, S4, and S5) in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. The reconstructed pCO \\(_2\\) values are within error of the ice core values but consistently exceed the ice core values by ca. 100 µatm. This offset corresponds with atmospheric disequilibrium of present day CO \\(_2\\) [aq] concentrations in the Mediterranean Sea from global pCO \\(_2\\) , equivalent to ca. 100 µatm, although pCO \\(_2\\) estimates derived from individual horizons within each sapropel do not covary with the ice core values. This may possibly be due to greater variability in local CO \\(_2\\) [aq] concentration changes in the Mediterranean, as compared with the global average pCO \\(_2\\) , or possibly due to biases in the proxy, such as variable growth rate or carbon-concentrating mechanisms. Thus, the offset is likely a combination of physiological or environmental factors. Nevertheless, our results demonstrate that alkenone- and phytol-based pCO \\(_2\\) proxies yield statistically similar estimations (P-value = 0.02, Pearson's r-value = 0.56), and yield reasonable absolute estimations although with relatively large uncertainties (±100 µatm). Blais, Brian S. Model Comparison in the Introductory Physics Laboratory. The Physics Teacher 58.3 (2020): 209-213. Model comparison is at the heart of all scientific methodologies. Progress is made in science by constructing many models (possibly of different complexities), testing them against measurements, and determining which of them explain the data the best. It is my observation, however, that in many introductory physics labs we provide students with the materials and methods to verify the \"correct\" model of the experiment they are performing, e.g. measuring \"g\" or verifying the period of a pendulum. In this way, we do our students a disservice and don't allow them to experience the richness and creativity that constitutes the scientific enterprise. Limiting the lab to the \"correct\" model can have its uses—for example, getting the students to practice the proper methods to measure lengths and times or to support the specific theory covered in the lecture portion of the class. However, when students perform these labs, they come to view these activities as repetitive and mechanical, reinforcing the notion that science concerns not the true exploration of nature but simply the verification of what we already know. By verifying what we already know, the laboratory experience does not improve overall understanding and can mislead students about the methods of science overall. 2018 Witkowski, C. R., Weijers, J.

This study applies dynamical and statistical modeling techniques to quantify the proliferation and popularity of trending hashtags on Twitter. Using time-series data reflecting actual tweets in New York City and San Francisco, we present estimates for the dynamics (i.e., rates of infection and recovery) of several hundred trending hashtags using an epidemic modeling framework coupled with Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. This methodological strategy is an extension of techniques traditionally used to model the spread of infectious disease. We demonstrate that in some models, hashtags can be grouped by infectiousness, possibly providing a method for quantifying the trendiness of a topic. 2014 Blais, B. S. 2014.

Bayesian analysis of epidemics - zombies, influenza, and other diseases . Available from the arXiv at http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.6376 as well as on ScienceOpen . This work is used as a tutorial for the pyndamics3 package, the Zombie models and data shown here Mathematical models of epidemic dynamics offer significant insight into predicting and controlling infectious diseases. The dynamics of a disease model generally follow a susceptible, infected, and recovered (SIR) model, with some standard modifications. In this paper, we extend the work of Munz et.al (2009) on the application of disease dynamics to the so-called ``zombie apocalypse'', and then apply the identical methods to influenza dynamics. Unlike Munz et.al (2009), we include data taken from specific depictions of zombies in popular culture films and apply Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods on improved dynamical representations of the system. To demonstrate the usefulness of this approach, beyond the entertaining example, we apply the identical methodology to Google Trend data on influenza to establish infection and recovery rates. Finally, we discuss the use of the methods to explore hypothetical intervention policies regarding disease outbreaks. Skaza, J. and Blais, B.S. 2013. The Relationship between Economic Growth and Environmental Degradation: Exploring Models and Questioning the Existence of an Environmental Kuznets Curve . Available from: http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2346173 and http://intranet.bryant.edu/portal/economic-studies/publications/working-papers.htm . In this paper, we explore a variety of models attempting to explain the pollution-income relationship (PIR). There has been much literature addressing the notion of an environmental Kuznets curve (EKC). Many researchers find an EKC relationship for certain pollutants, while others do not find evidence of an EKC relationship. There is also literature formally critiquing the EKC. We employ cross-sectional, panel, and time-series analysis to add insight into the relationship between economic growth and environmental degradation, a research area that is far from consensual and that has practical implications. We ultimately find that the clearest case of an EKC effect in our study arises in the analysis of organic water pollution, while there is modest evidence suggesting an EKC effect with regard to CO \\(_2\\) , NO, and methane. We also present ample evidence suggesting an anti-EKC effect for PM10. Our analysis causes us to question the existence of an EKC effect throughout the environment in general. 2011 Yang, H., Blais, B.S., Leng, Q. 2011. Stable isotope variations from cultivated Metasequoia trees in the United States: A statistical approach to assess isotope signatures as climate signals. Jpn. J. His tor. Bot. 19 (1-2) pp 75-88. We measured I'C and I'15N values and carbon and nitrogen elemental concentrations of leaves collected from Metasequoia glyptostroboides Hu et Cheng trees cultivated at 39 sites across the United States under different latitudes and climatic regions. I'D values from south facing leaf n-alkanes of 27 trees were also determined. Climate data over the past 50 years (1950a2009) were compiled from stations near each site. Isotope data were cross plotted against each geographic and climatic parameter, including latitude, annual mean temperature (AMT), spring (FebruaryaMay) mean temperature (SMT), annual mean precipitation (AMP), and spring mean precipitation (SMP). Statistical analyses revealed the following signicant correlations: 1) a strong negative correlation between n-alkane D and latitude; 2) statistically signicant correlations between D and both AMT and SMT; 3) a weaker but still signicant correlation between I'D and SMP; 4) statistically signicant relationships between carbon concentration and both temperature and precipitation parameters, especially AMP; 5) an unexpected correlation between nitrogen concentration and SMP. These results bear strong implications for using I'13C and I'D values obtained from fossil Metasequoia as paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental proxies. Blais, B.S. 2011. Automatic Flushing Toilets: An Entertaining Platform for Exploring Scientific Thinking . Physics Teacher . 49 (3): 162. It is often challenging, especially at the beginning of a course, to find good examples where students can actively explore and grapple with the methods of science. We want them to learn the connection between observation, theory, prediction, evidence, and falsification, but to really accomplish this we need platforms for which the students are able to design and implement experiments, and we need to be able to see the results of those experiments relatively quickly. There are some nice ideas using games1 and simple demonstrations and labs.2,3 I have found an example that is both entertaining for the students and rich enough in behavior to be an ideal platform for introducing scientific thinking: the automatic flushing toilet (Fig. 1). 2010 Blais.

LEGO MINDSTORMSA(r) NXT (Lego Group, 2006) is a perfect platform for introducing programming concepts, and is generally targeted toward children from age 8-14. The language which ships with the MINDSTORMSA(r), called NXTg, is a graphical language based on LabVIEW (Jeff Kodosky, 2010). Although there is much value in graphical languages, such as LabVIEW, a text-based alternative can be targeted at an older audiences and serve as part of a more general introduction to modern computing. Other languages, such as NXC (Not Exactly C) (Hansen, 2010) and PbLua (Hempel, 2010), fit this description. Here we introduce PyNXC, a subset of the Python language which can be used to program the NXT MINDSTORMSA(r). We present results using PyNXC, comparisons with other languages, and some challenges and future possible extensions. PyNXC Project webpage on Googlecode.

Effect of correlated lateral geniculate nucleus firing rates on predictions for monocular eye closure versus monocular retinal inactivation Physical Review E 80 (6): 061915. Monocular deprivation experiments can be used to distinguish between different ideas concerning properties of cortical synaptic plasticity. Monocular deprivation by lid suture causes a rapid disconnection of the deprived eye connected to cortical neurons whereas total inactivation of the deprived eye produces much less of an ocular dominance shift. In order to understand these results one needs to know how lid suture and retinal inactivation affect neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) that provide the cortical input. Recent experimental results by Linden et al. showed that monocular lid suture and monocular inactivation do not change the mean firing rates of LGN neurons but that lid suture reduces correlations between adjacent neurons whereas monocular inactivation leads to correlated firing. These, somewhat surprising, results contradict assumptions that have been made to explain the outcomes of different monocular deprivation protocols. Based on these experimental results we modify our assumptions about inputs to cortex during different deprivation protocols and show their implications when combined with different cortical plasticity rules. Using theoretical analysis, random matrix theory and simulations we show that high levels of correlations reduce the ocular dominance shift in learning rules that depend on homosynaptic depression (i.e., Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro type rules), consistent with experimental results, but have the opposite effect in rules that depend on heterosynaptic depression (i.e., Hebbian/principal component analysis type rules). 2008 Blais, B.S, Frenkel M. , Kuindersma S., Muhammad R., Shouval H.Z, Cooper, L.N , and Bear M. F. 2008 Recovery from monocular deprivation using binocular deprivation: Experimental observations and theoretical analysis . Journal of Neurophysiology 100:2217-2224. Ocular dominance (OD) plasticity is a robust paradigm for examining the functional consequences of synaptic plasticity. Previous experimental and theoretical results have shown that OD plasticity can be accounted for by known synaptic plasticity mechanisms, using the assumption that deprivation by lid suture eliminates spatial structure in the deprived channel. Here we show that in the mouse, recovery from monocular lid suture can be obtained by subsequent binocular lid suture but not by dark rearing. This poses a significant challenge to previous theoretical results. We therefore performed simulations with a natural input environment appropriate for mouse visual cortex. In contrast to previous work we assume that lid suture causes degradation but not elimination of spatial structure, whereas dark rearing produces elimination of spatial structure. We present experimental evidence that supports this assumption, measuring responses through sutured lids in the mouse. The change in assumptions about the input environment is sufficient to account for new experimental observations, while still accounting for previous experimental results. Blais, B.S. and Cooper, L.N 2008. BCM Theory . Scholarpedia 3(3):1570. BCM (Bienenstock et al., 1982) refers to the theory of synaptic modification first proposed by Elie Bienenstock, Leon Cooper, and Paul Munro in 1982 to account for experiments measuring the selectivity of neurons in primary sensory [8]cortex and its dependency on neuronal input. It is characterized by a rule expressing synaptic change as a Hebb-like product of the presynaptic activity and a nonlinear function, \\phi(y;\\theta_M) , of postsynatic activity, y. For low values of the postsynaptic activity ( y<\\theta_M ), \\phi is negative; for y>\\theta_M , \\phi is positive. The rule is stabilized by allowing the modification threshold, \\theta_M , to vary as a super-linear function of the previous activity of the cell. Unlike traditional methods of stabilizing Hebbian learning, this \"sliding threshold\" provides a mechanism for incoming patterns, as opposed to converging afferents, to compete. A detailed exploration can be found in the book Theory of Cortical Plasticity (Cooper et al., 2004). For an open-source implementation of the BCM, amongst other synaptic modification rules, see the Plasticity package [1] . 2007 Kuindersma, S.R. and Blais, B.S. 2007. Teaching Bayesian Model Comparison With the Three-sided Coin . American Statistician . Vol. 61, No. 3, August 2007 pp.239-244 In the present work we introduce the problem of determining the probability that a rotating and bouncing cylinder (i.e. flipped coin) will land and come to rest on its edge. We present this problem and analysis as a practical, nontrivial example to introduce the reader to Bayesian model comparison. Several models are presented, each of which take into consideration different physical aspects of the problem and the relative effects on the edge landing probability. The Bayesian formulation of model comparison is then used to compare the models and their predictive agreement with data from hand-flipped cylinders of several sizes. Shouval, H.Z, Gavornik, J.

In recently published findings we provided evidence that pairing visual cues with subsequent rewards in awake behaving animals results in the emergence, in the primary visual cortex (V1), of reward-timing activity (Shuler and Bear, 2006). Further, the properties of reward-timing activity suggest that it is generated locally within V1, implying that V1 is privy to a signal relating the acquisition of reward. We provide here a model demonstrating how such interval timing of reward could emerge in V1. A fundamental assumption of this work is that the timing characteristics of the V1 network are encoded in the lateral connectivity within the network, consequently the plasticity assumed in this model is of these recurrent connections. Using this assumption, no prior stimulus-locked temporal representation is necessary. The plasticity of recurrent connections is implemented through an interaction between an activity dependent Hebbian like plasticity, and a neuromodulatory signal signifying reward. It is demonstrated that such a global reinforcement signal is sufficient for interval time learning by stabilizing changes in nascent synaptic efficacy resultant from prior visually-evoked activity. By modifying synaptic weight change within the recurrent network of V1, our model transforms temporally restricted visual events into neurally persistent activity relating to their associated reward timing expectancy. 2006 Shouval, H.Z, Bear, M.F., and Blais, B.S. 2006. The cellular basis of receptive field plasticity in visual cortex, an integrative experimental and theoretical approach . In Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience (CRCNS) Conference . Synaptic plasticity is a likely basis for information storage by the neocortex. Understanding cortical plasticity requires coordinated investigation of both underlying cellular mechanisms and their systems-level consequences in the same model system. However, establishing connections between the cellular and system levels of description is non-trivial. A major contribution of theoretical neuroscience is that it can link different levels of description, and in doing so can direct experiments to the questions of greatest relevance. The objective of the current project is to generate a theoretical description of experience-dependent plasticity in the rodent visual system. The advantages of rodents are, first, that knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity is relatively mature and continues to be advanced with genetic and pharmacological experiments, and second, rodents show robust receptive field plasticity in visual cortex (VC) that can be easily and inexpensively monitored with chronic recording methods. The project aims are threefold. First, the activity of inputs to rat visual cortex will be recorded in different viewing conditions that induce receptive field (RF) plasticity, and these data will be integrated into formal models of synaptic plasticity. Second, the dynamics of RF plasticity will be simulated using existing spike rate-based algorithms and compared will experimental observations. Third, the consequences of new biophysically plausible plasticity algorithms, based on spike timing and metaplasticity, will be analyzed and compared with experiments.6 Yang, H., Blais B.S., Perez, G.

In Abstracts of 2006 American Geophysical Union (AGU) Fall Meeting To examine climatic signals registered as carbon isotopic values in leaf tissues of C3 plants, we collected mature leaf tissues from northern and southern leaves from the 1947 batch of Metasequoia trees planted along a latitudinal gradient of the United States. Samples from 40 individual trees, along with fossilized material from the early Tertiary of the Canadian Arctic, were analyzed for C and N concentration and isotopic values. After the removal of free lipids, EA-IRMS was used to measure both concentration and bulk C and N isotopic values on leaf residues. The generated datasets were then merged with climate data compiled from each tree site recorded as average values over the past thirty years (1971-2002, NOAA database). When the isotope data were cross plotted against each geographic and climatic indicator, Latitude, Mean Annual Temperature (MAT), Average Summer Mean Temperature (ASMT)(June-August), Mean Annual Precipitation (MAP), and Average Summer Mean Precipitation (ASMP) respectively correlation patterns were revealed. The best correlating trend was obtained between temperature parameters and C isotopic values, and this correlation is stronger in the northern leaf samples than the southern samples. The Nitrogen data remained inconclusive as the result of the N isotope signals being site specific. This investigation represents a comprehensive examination on climatic signals registered as C isotopic values on a single species that is marked by single genetic source. The results bear implications on paleoclimatic interpretations of C isotopic signals obtained from fossil plant tissues. 2005 Blais, B.S. and Kuindersma, S. 2005. Synaptic Modification in Spiking-Rate Models: A Comparison between Learning in Spiking Neurons and Rate-Based Neuron Models In Society For Neuroscience Conference Abstracts Rate-based neuron models have been successful in understanding many aspects of development such as the development of orientation selectivity(Bienenstock et al., 1982; Oja, 1982; Linsker, 1986; Miller, 1992; Bell and Sejnowski, 1997), the particular dynamics of visual deprivation(Blais et al., 1999) and the development of direction selectivity(Wimbauer et al., 1997; Blais et al., 2000). These models do not address phenomena such as temporal coding, spike-timing dependant synaptic plasticity, or any short-time behavior of neurons. More detailed spiking models (Song et.al, 2000; Shouval et.al. 2002; Yeung et.al. 2004) address these issues, and have had some success, but have failed to develop receptive fields in natural environments. These more detailed models are diffiult to explore, given their large number of parameters and the run-time computational limitations. In addition, their results are often diffiult to compare directly with the rate-based models. We propose a model, which we call a spiking-rate model, which can serve as a middle-ground between the over simplistic rate-based models, and the more detailed spiking models. The spiking-rate model is a spiking model where all of the underlying processes are continuous Poisson, the summation of inputs is entirely linear (although non-linearities can be added), and the generation of outputs is done by calculating a rate output and then generating an appropriate Poisson spike train. In this way, the limiting behavior is identical to a rate-based model, but the proper ties of spiking models can be incorporated more easily. We present the development of receptive i!elds with this model in various visual environments. We then present the necessary conditions for the receptive field development in the spiking-rate models, and make comparisons to detailed spiking models, in order to more clearly understand the necessary conditions for receptive field development 2004 Yeung, L.C., Shouval, H.Z, Blais, B.S., Cooper, L. N. 2004. Synaptic Homeostasis and Input Selectivity Follow From a Calcium-Dependent Plasticity Model . Proceedings of the National Academy of Science . Vol 101, Issue 41. 14943-14948. Modifications in the strengths of synapses are thought to underlie memory, learning, and development of cortical circuits. Many cellular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity have been investigated in which differential elevations of postsynaptic calcium concentrations play a key role in determining the direction and magnitude of synaptic changes. We have previously described a model of plasticity that uses calcium currents mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors as the associative signal for Hebbian learning. However, this model is not completely stable. Here, we propose a mechanism of stabilization through homeostatic regulation of intracellular calcium levels. With this model, synapses are stable and exhibit properties such as those observed in metaplasticity and synaptic scaling. In addition, the model displays synaptic competition, allowing structures to emerge in the synaptic space that reflect the statistical properties of the inputs. Therefore, the combination of a fast calcium-dependent learning and a slow stabilization mechanism can account for both the formation of selective receptive fields and the maintenance of neural circuits in a state of equilibrium.

This invaluable book presents a theory of cortical plasticity and shows how this theory leads to experiments that test both its assumptions and consequences. It ellucidates, in a manner that is accessible to students as well as researchers, the role which the BCM theory has played in guiding research and suggesting experiments that have led to our present understanding of the mechanisms underlying cortical plasticity. Most of the connections betwen theory and experiment that are discussed require complex simulations. A unique feature of the book is the accompanying software package, Plasticity . This is provided complete with source code, and enables the reader to repeat any of the simulations quoted in the book as well as to vary either parameters or assumptions. * Plasticity * is thus a research and an educational tool. Readers can use it to obtain hands-on knowledge of the structure of BCM and various other learning algorithms. They can check and replicate our results as well as test algorithms and refinements of their own. 2003 Brian S. Blais. 2003.

Calcium as the associative biochemical signal for a model of Hebbian plasticity . Neurocomputing 52-54:376-440. The sign and magnitude of bi-directional synaptic plasticity have been shown to depend on: the rate of presynaptic stimulation, the level of postsynaptic depolarization, and the precise relative timing between pre and postsynaptic spikes. It has been proposed that these different induction paradigms can coexist, and be accounted for by a single learning rule that depends on the dynamics of intracellular calcium concentration. We extend this rule to a multi-synaptic environment, where collective properties such as cooperativity, competition and selectivity can be investigated. Yeung, L.C., Blais, B.S., Cooper, L.

Homeostatic Metaplasticity Accounts for Synaptic Scaling. In Society For Neuroscience Conference Abstracts . Recently, a new property of synaptic plasticity, named synaptic scaling, has been described (Turrigiano et al., 1998). Synaptic scaling is an activity-dependent physiological mechanism for preserving cortical homeostasis. Its underlying biophysical basis, however, is not yet elucidated. Homeostatic metaplasticity had previously been proposed as a means of stabilizing the inherently unstable Hebbian plasticity. For example, the BCM theory of synaptic plasticity assumes a sliding modification threshold that stabilizes learning while producing selective receptive fields (Bienenstock et al., 1982). Here, we suggest a biophysical formulation of metaplasticity as the underlying mechanism for synaptic scaling. We have recently developed a unified theory of synaptic plasticity that can account for various induction paradigms (Shouval et al., 2002). In this model, AMPA receptor plasticity is induced by calcium transients through NMDA receptors. Thus changing the properties of NMDA receptors can alter the form of synaptic plasticity. We propose a form of metaplasticity that is based on cell-wide activity-dependent regulation of NMDA receptor conductance. Simulations of this combined plasticity-metaplasticity system show that, as the average input rate increases, synaptic weights decay, and the resulting distribution of synaptic weights is unimodal. In addition, the output-firing rate is roughly maintained, even in the absence of hard constraints on individual or the average synaptic weights. Therefore, metaplasticity and synaptic plasticity can account for the experimental observations of synaptic scaling and maintain cortical homeostasis. Additional mechanisms that explicitly enforce scaling are not required.

Intracellular calcium concentration has been proposed as the key associative signal for the Hebbian synaptic plasticity.

Here, we investigate the properties of this model in a multi-synapse neuron receiving inputs with different spatiotemporal spike train statistics.

Demonstration in Neural Information Processing Systems: Natural and Synthetic, NIPS 2002* We present a simulation environment, Plasticity , which allows the user to perform a wide variety of simulations of rate-based neural networks. The package focuses on, but is not limited to, simulations of visual neurons and allows one to compare on equal footing many of the most common learning rules. This includes variants of Hebbian learning( Linsker, 1986; MacKay and Miller, 1994; Erwin and Miller, 1998), BCM(Bienenstock et al., 1982; Intrator and Cooper, 1992; Blais et al., 1999), and ICA(Hyvarinen and Oja, 1997; Blais et al., 1998). The goal of this package is consistent with the philosophy of reproducible research: providing a complete package which can fully reproduce any results or figures in publications.(Schwab et al., 2000). One aspect of this package which makes it different than other neural network packages is that it allows the user to explore environments from simplified low dimensional vectors(Clothiaux et al., 1991), to high dimensional correlation-based environments( Erwin and Miller, 1998) to natural images(Blais et al., 1998). The package is currently being extended to include spike-based learning. Yeung, L.C., Blais, B.S., Cooper, L. N, and Shouval, H. Z. 2002.

Biological Cybernetics: Special Issue ``Hebb in Perspective'' . 87 (5-6) 383-391. Different mechanisms that could form the molecular basis for bi-directional synaptic plasticity have been identified experimentally and corresponding biophysical models can be constructed. However, such models are complex and therefore it is hard to deduce their consequences to compare them to existing abstract models of synaptic plasticity. In this paper we examine two such models:a phenomenological one inspired by the phenomena of AMPA receptor insertion, and a more complex biophysical model based on the phenomena of AMPA receptor phosphorylation. We show that under certain approximations both these models can be mapped on to an equivalent, calcium-dependent, differential equation. Intracellular calcium concentration varies locally in each postsynaptic compartment, thus the plasticity rule we extract is a single-synapse rule. We convert this single synapse plasticity equation to a multi- synapse rule by incorporating a model of the NMDA receptor. Finally we suggest a mathematical embodiment of metaplasticity, which is consistent with observations on NMDA receptor properties and dependence on cellular activity. These results, in combination with some of our previous results, produce converging evidence for the calcium control hypothesis including a dependence of synaptic plasticity on the level of intercellular calcium as well as on the temporal pattern of calcium transients. 2000 A.

Sci. Vol. 97, Issue 23. 2000. 12875-12879. The receptive fields for simple cells in visual cortex show a strong preference for edges of a particular orientation and display adjacent excitatory and inhibitory subfields. These subfields are projections from ON-center and OFF-center lateral geniculate nucleus cells, respectively. Here we present a single-cell model using ON and OFF channels, a natural scene environment, and synaptic modification according to the Bienenstock, Cooper, and Munro (BCM) theory. Our results indicate that lateral geniculate nucleus cells must act predominantly in the linear region around the level of spontaneous activity, to lead to the observed segregation of ON/OFF subfields.

Vol 12, Number 5. 2000. 1057-1066 Most simple and complex cells in the cat striate cortex are both orientation and direction selective. In this paper we use single cell learning rules to develop both orientation and direction selectition and direction selectivity in a natural scene environment. We show that a simple PCA rule is inadequate for developing direction selectivity, but that the BCM rule as well as similar higher order rules can. We also demonstrate that the convergence of lagged and non-lagged cells depends on the velocity of motion in the environment, and that strobe rearing disrupts this convergence resulting in a loss of direction selectivity. 1999 G. David Poznik, On Activity-Dependent Development in the Mammalian Visual System Prior to Visual Experience , 1999. (Undergraduate Thesis, supervised by B. S. Blais) . We offer an explanation of the pre-eye-opening development of four properties of the mammalian visual system: cortical orientation selectivity, the localized nature of retinogeniculate connections, the retinotopic map in the LGN, and the eye-specific lamination of the LGN. We investigate the possibility that the development of these properties results from structure in the activity of the prenatal visual environment. Three separate approaches are taken to modeling this activity. We model the prenatal visual environment as consisting of either: explicitly correlated noise, retinally processed noise, or retinal waves. A study oretinal waves. A study of the behavior of the BCM and PCA learning rules in these model environments leads to an understanding of the emergence of the four visual system properties. Both rules are consistent with the initial development of orientation selectivity, but, unlike BCM, the PCA rule is unable to account for the development of the LGN properties. Ann B. Lee, B. S. Blais, H. Shouval, and L. N Cooper, Statistics of LGN activity determine the segregation of ON/OFF subfields for simple cells in cortex , CNS99 . Visual cortical simple cells show a strong preference for edges of a particular orientation[Hubel and Wiesel,1962]. The receptive field of the cortical cell shows adjacent excitatory and inhibitory subfields, which are projections from ON-center and OFF-center LGN cells, respectively[Reid and Alonso,1995]. Here we present a single cell model using ON and OFF channels, a natural scene environment, and the BCM[Bienenstock et al.,1982] learning rule. The results from the model imply that the input distribution from LGN to cortex should be almost symmetrical in order to develop the proper segregation of ON/OFF subfields; There is a relation between the organization of simple cell receptive fields and the shape ofelds and the shape of the input distribution.

N Cooper, The Role of Presynaptic Activity in Monocular Deprivation: Comparison of Homosynaptic and Heterosynaptic Mechanisms , Proceedings of the National Academy of Science . Vol. 96, 1999. Although there have been extensive investigations in computational neuroscience, the opportunity (that has made such a marked difference in physical sciences) to test detailed and subtle quantitative consequences of a theory against experimental results is rare. In this paper we outline a testable consequence of two contrasting theories of synaptic plasticity applied to the disconnection in visual cortex of the closed eye in monocular deprivation (MD). This disconnection is sometimes thought to be the consequence of a process that stems from a competition of inputs for a limited resource such as neurotrophin. Such a process leads to what we call spatial competition, or heterosynaptic synaptic modification. A contrasting view, exemplified by the Bienenstock, Cooper, and Munro (BCM) theory, is that patterns of input activity compete in the temporal domain. This temporal competition is homosynaptic and does not require a conserved resource. The two erved resource. The two mechanisms, homosynaptic and heterosynaptic, are the distinguishing characteristics of two general classes of learning rules which we explore, using a realistic environment composed of natural scenes. These alternative views lead to opposite dependence on the level of presynaptic activity of the rate of disconnection of the closed eye in monocular deprivation. This strong and testable consequence sets the stage for a critical distinguishing experiment; the experiment has been done and supports the second view. These results have important implications for the processes of learning and memory storage in neocortex. 1998 B. S. Blais. The Role of the Environment in Synaptic Plasticity: Towards an Understanding of Learning and Memory (PhD Dissertation) . Introduction Visual Deprivation Projection Pursuit Extensions to the Model]( http://web.bryant.edu/~bblais/pdf/chap-extensions.pdf ) Conclusions]( http://web.bryant.edu/~bblais/pdf/chap-conclusions.pdf ) Appendix]( http://web.bryant.edu/~bblais/pdf/appendix.pdf ) It is widely believed that much of learning, memory storage, and resulting organization of many parts of the brain occur due to the modification of the efficacy or strength of at least some of the synaptic junctions between neurons. The genetic code is not large enough to specify the strength of all of the synapses in the brain, so it is more reasonable to assume that there are some general mechanisms for modifying the synapses of a neuron based on the input signals to that neuron. In nals to that neuron. In this way the neuron becomes adaptive to the structure in the input patterns, or the environment. The environment, therefore, plays a crucial role in the formation of the general properties of neurons and may give us a significant insight into the formation of memory. The central theme of this work is role of the environment in the development, and maintenance, of orientation selectivity and ocular dominance in the visual cortex. We compare statistically and biologically motivated learning rules in a realistic model of the input environment, consisting of natural scene images. From simulations and analysis we are able to propose experiments, some of which are currently being performed, in order to distinguish between different synaptic modification rules, which in turn allows us to get a glimpse at some of the possible underlying mechanisms. An understanding of the properties of the learning rules, in relation to the environment, allows us to propose a simplified environment which is analytically tractable. This environment captures some of the qualitative features of the natural scene images, but provides a better understanding of the role of the environment in learning. Other modifications of the input environment, some motivated by biology, are also presented. These modifications are beginning to give the first indications of some of the subtle effects of the environment: effects which can have a profound impact on the response properties of neurons and the organization of many parts of the brain.

Most simple cells in the cat striate cortex are both orientation and direction selective. In this paper we use single cell learning rules to develop both orientation and direction selectivity in a natural scene environment. We show that a simple PCA rule is inadequate to develop direchow that a simple PCA rule is inadequate to develop direction selectivity, but that the BCM rule and similar rules can. We compare these models to experiments in motion deprived environments, such as strobe rearing, and show some connections between the development of direction and orientation selectivity. B. S.

We study several statistically and biologically motivated learning rules using the same visual environment, one made up of natural scenes, and the same single cell neuronal architecture. This allows us to concentrate on the feature extraction and neuronal coding properties of these rules. Included in these rules are kurtosis and skewness maximization, the quadratic form of the BCM learning rule, and single cell ICA. Using a structure removal method, we demonstrate that receptive fields developed using these rules depend on a small portion of the distribution. We find that the quadratic form of the BCM rule behaves in a manner similar to a kurtosis maximization rule when the distribution contains kurtotic directions, although the BCM modification equatioCM modification equations are computationally simpler. 1997 B.

Why is it that physicists would choose to study the brain, a topic which one usually associates with biology? Why choose this rather than pursue more traditional lines of research? Do physicists have something to offer to the field which others have lacked? These questions force us to look closely at the process of science, and how physicists like to look at the world. B. S. Blais, H. Shouval, and L.

Receptive fields in the visual cortex can be altered by changing the visual environment, as has been shown many times in deprivation experiments. In this paper we simulate this set of experiments using two different models of cortical plasticity, BCM and PCA. The visual environment used is composed of natural images for open eye and of noise for closed eyes. We measure the response of the neurons to oriented stirse information of the neuronal response to provide a preliminary quantitative comparison between the cortical models and experiment. 1995 M. P.

The Noise Sensitivity Signature (NSS), originally introduced by Grossman and Lapedes (1993), was proposed as an alternative to cross validation for selecting network complexity. In this paper, we extend NSS to the general problem of regression estimation. We also present results from regularized linear regression simulations which indicate that for problems with few data points, NSS regression estimates perform better than Generalized Cross Validation (GCV) regression estimates [Wahba90].

I was introduced to it with the so-called lighthouse problem and E T Jaynes's excellent Confidence Intervals vs Bayesian Intervals paper. Although this distribution has a single-peak with a central value, \\(x_o\\) , and looks vaguely Gaussian, it has many mathematical properties which make it much different. For example, it has an undefined mean and variance, and thus doesn't satisfy the conditions for the central limit theorem. As such it is never covered in introductory statistics classes. However, with the computational approach described here, it is no harder to work with the Cauchy than the Normal. Setting up the problem In E T Jaynes's example, the data consist simply of two data points: \\(\\{x_i\\} = \\{3,5\\}\\) . Remarkably, frequentist methods can't address this problem.

Thus, the estimate we find above, \\(x_o \\sim 4\\) , matches what we intuit to be the correct answer. The point here, however, is that the same Bayesian methods for finding the best estimates and the uncertainties works for this case like all the others -- with very little extra work -- whereas traditional methods fail. It is telling that statistics textbooks uniformly ignore this entire distribution as far as I can tell just to avoid the problems with it. The Bayesian approach, in contrast, provides a uniform procedure to address all such problems and that procedure consistently produces useful results.","tags":"math","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2021/Aug/11/stats-101-examples-with-mcmc-part-4/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2021/Aug/11/stats-101-examples-with-mcmc-part-4/"},{"title":"Convert mp3 files to audiobook for Apple Books","text":"The Mac/iPhone Books app has some issues. Before switching the content out of iTunes into a separate app, audiobooks were housed in the same app as music. You could edit the metadata on individual tracks, you could easily import an audiobook cd and just change the type to \"Audiobook\" and things would work. If something was wrong with the title of a track, or the track number, you could go in and edit it. Once they switched to Books, this level of editing was no longer possible. Until recently I was doing the tedious task of editing in Music, copying to Books, seeing errors, copying back etc... The errors were often things like Books breaking the audiobook into separate \"books\" because the track numbers weren't read right, or the tracks would be out of order, or the artwork wouldn't come through. I was ok with this workaround tedium until recently, when I wanted to start following a youtube channel called Digital Gnosis . One of my favorite playlists is called Bad Apologetics , with 15 episodes so far with an average length around 7 and a half hours a piece ! So this state of affairs has forced me to retool my workflow, because I can't be at my computer to watch a 9 hour video, and I don't want to pay youtube to be able to listen while my phone is locked, and there are too many videos/playlists to deal with by hand. So here goes my solution. Make a folder of mp3 files Using the tool youtube-dl, installed with pip install youtube-dl --upgrade we download all of the videos in a playlist, convert to mp3, and put them in the current folder. This playlist is called Open Conversations, so I put it in a folder named for that. youtube-dl -i --extract-audio --audio-format mp3 \"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLggkCqSR7N1dBxUjy51NdVGPJ78JXEdl-\" One can also do this by importing audiobook CDs and place the tracks in a folder. Get the book info correct We continue with a script to get the track titles correct. This part is a little manual, because the naming scheme for the tracks are individual to the playlist. A little bit of string magic does the trick. from glob import glob folder = 'Open Conversations' fnames = sorted ( glob ( folder + \"/*.mp3\" )) display ( fnames ) Output: ['Open Conversations/Open Conversation #001-vCEu612_tbc.mp3', 'Open Conversations/Open Conversation #002-DW6LTgzxI2c.mp3', 'Open Conversations/Open Conversation #003-yxF3OJpLW8w.mp3', 'Open Conversations/Open Conversation #004-kBSczog9hjY.mp3', 'Open Conversations/Open Conversation #005-Ba9JeLKLx4M.mp3', 'Open Conversations/Open Conversation #006 _ Defining Terms and Open Conversation with JIL-ypzf9gCPMW4.mp3', 'Open Conversations/Open Conversation #007-mrzHt60jaJ0.mp3', 'Open Conversations/Open Conversation #008- Socially Distanced New Year Open Hangout - PineCreek, Cam, Erin, Autumn, Rob, etc-8yGK_yh-CTY.mp3', 'Open Conversations/Open Conversation #009-T-V0VnGG_FI.mp3', 'Open Conversations/Open Conversation #010-IcN-O-cbP80.mp3', 'Open Conversations/Open Conversation #011-hfIJLjO7xss.mp3', 'Open Conversations/Open Conversation #012-XD-Al7-_ezM.mp3', 'Open Conversations/Open Conversation #013-WxwxA5I-pN4.mp3', 'Open Conversations/Open Conversation #014-STmBT9OSNVw.mp3', 'Open Conversations/Open Conversation #015-ClVDRgd29aY.mp3', 'Open Conversations/Open Conversation #016-RjiSEfq4NJY.mp3', 'Open Conversations/Open Conversation #017 - 500 Arguments Against Christianity Aftershow-TVEEgX6NqbE.mp3', 'Open Conversations/Open Conversation #018 - James Fodor, Causation, Craig and more...-Kj3L8L3vXZI.mp3'] album = folder artist = 'Digital Gnosis' artwork = 'Open Converstions Cover.png' mime = 'image/png' # this part has to be done by hand because each # person's playlist has a different naming format titles = [ _ [: - 16 ] . replace ( 'Open Conversations/Open Conversation ' , 'Open Conversations - Ep ' ) for _ in fnames ] display ( titles ) Output: ['Open Conversations - Ep #001', 'Open Conversations - Ep #002', 'Open Conversations - Ep #003', 'Open Conversations - Ep #004', 'Open Conversations - Ep #005', 'Open Conversations - Ep #006 _ Defining Terms and Open Conversation with JIL', 'Open Conversations - Ep #007', 'Open Conversations - Ep #008- Socially Distanced New Year Open Hangout - PineCreek, Cam, Erin, Autumn, Rob, etc', 'Open Conversations - Ep #009', 'Open Conversations - Ep #010', 'Open Conversations - Ep #011', 'Open Conversations - Ep #012', 'Open Conversations - Ep #013', 'Open Conversations - Ep #014', 'Open Conversations - Ep #015', 'Open Conversations - Ep #016', 'Open Conversations - Ep #017 - 500 Arguments Against Christianity Aftershow', 'Open Conversations - Ep #018 - James Fodor, Causation, Craig and more...'] NOTE: Having the album name in the track title, followed by \" - \" and the track name seems to be important for the Books app to get the title and tracks right for some reason. Write out the mp3 meta data with the mutagen library.

This could be the number of heads observed in \\(N\\) coin flips and we want to estimate the bias in the coin -- what is the probability that it flips heads. In fact, the data I will use below is from Lindley, 1976. \"Inference for a Bernoulli Process (A Bayesian View)\" , where he flips a thumbtack which might be able to produce two states pointing \"up\" or pointing \"down\", and gets the data UUUDUDUUUUUD (3 D, 9 U). Setting up the problem For a Bayesian solution, we need to specify the likelihood function -- how our model produces the data -- and the prior probability for the parameters. The likelihood function is determined from the Bernoulli function, $$ \\begin{eqnarray} P(h|N,\\theta) &\\sim& \\text{Bernoulli}(N,\\theta) \\\\ \\end{eqnarray} $$ In the \" Statistics 101 \" examples, the results are typically equivalent to uniform priors on the location parameters. This would translate to $$ \\begin{eqnarray} P(\\theta) &\\sim& \\text{Uniform}(0,1) \\end{eqnarray} $$ However there are cases where we have more information. Even flipping a biased coin, we know that both outcomes (heads and tails) are at least possible to happen. Given this, the probabilities \\(P(\\theta=0)\\) and \\(P(\\theta=1)\\) should be zero and a different prior is justified (sidenote -- the maximum entropy solution to this is a Beta(2,2) distribution or, in other words, assume one heads and one tails have been observed before the data). I'll continue with this example with uniform priors, because in Lindley, 1976. \"Inference for a Bernoulli Process (A Bayesian View)\" he is flipping a particular thumbtack for which it might not be possible for it to, say, flip \"down\". His data turns out to be 3 down, 9 up, so we know after the data it was possible for both outcomes but not before the data. def lnlike ( data , θ ): h , N = data return logbernoullipdf ( θ , h , N ) data = 3 , 12 model = MCMCModel ( data , lnlike , θ = Uniform ( 0 , 1 ), ) Running MCMC, looking at the results Now we run MCMC, plot the chains (so we can see it has converged) and look at distributions, model . run_mcmc ( 800 , repeat = 3 ) model . plot_chains () Sampling Prior...

Comparing to textbook examples The textbook only considers large sample proportions, with the definition \\(f= h/N\\) . From the Beta distribution we get our estimate of the proportion \\begin{eqnarray} \\hat{\\theta} &\\sim& f \\\\ \\sigma&#94;2 &\\sim& \\frac{f\\cdot (1-f)}{N} \\end{eqnarray} which matches the equations in the standard textbooks. Comparing to our case, with \\(N=120\\) we get good agreement, However, we start seeing differences where the textbook treatment isn't as informative as the methods we're using here. For small samples, say \\(N=12\\) , we see that the textbook approximation breaks down -- especially near the \\(f=0\\) and \\(f=1\\) boundaries, sometimes overestimating our certainty and sometimes underestimating it. Notice, however, that in the current approach we didn't need to change anything to get more robust answers. Also notice that the current process for this problem is identical to the process for all of the other cases we've considered. So what we are presenting, compared to the textbook treatments, is a more unified approach which generalizes to small samples giving a more correct analysis for our data.","tags":"math","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2021/May/13/stats-101-examples-with-mcmc-part-3/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2021/May/13/stats-101-examples-with-mcmc-part-3/"},{"title":"Stats 101 Examples with MCMC Part 2","text":"This is another in the series of \" Statistics 101 \" examples solved with MCMC.

My first approach, which is approximate, is to determine the resulting kinetic energy when they come together and assume (badly) that it was a constant acceleration to determine the time. This will low-ball the time but be easy to calculate. My second approach is to numerically simulate the system in pyndamics3 .

I went over her solutions when she did the practice questions so that she would have another resource to explain the concepts involved. Due the new format this year, adjusting to the COVID-19 restrictions, there were only four such practice problems available to work from. Although the four questions were generally pretty good, I thought, the official solution to a quarter of one of the questions was simply incorrect. It's a good example of how assumptions affect any problem, how a simple problem can get messy quickly, and how one can use computation to explore even a messy version of a physics problem. I was unable to solve the final part analytically because of an assumption the official solution made that was not explicitly stated in the problem. It turned out that this assumption was not physically reasonable, but was necessary in order to actually solve the problem. The introduction to the problem is given here: A student is given a spring that does NOT obey Hooke's Law. The student is told that the relationship between the magnitude of the force exerted by the spring and the magnitude of the spring's stretch or compression is given by the function \\(F = Bx&#94;3\\) . The student wishes to determine whether this is the correct relationship between \\(F\\) and \\(x\\) and, if it is, to determine the value of \\(B\\) . The student fixes the spring to a vertical wall just above a flat table, as shown above. The student also has a cart of known mass \\(M\\) that has light wheels and frictionless bearings. The student also has access to a meterstick and a scientific calculator that can perform four functions, exponents and roots, but cannot perform curve fitting or analyze lists of data. (a) State the measurements that the student should make, and give each measurement a meaningful algebraic symbol. (b) Describe the procedure that the student should follow in order to make the measurements necessary to accomplish the student's purpose. (c) Explain how the student should use the measurements in order to accomplish the student's purpose. Explicitly explain how the relationship between \\(F\\) and \\(x\\) can be tested and the value of \\(B\\) determined. (d) Suppose that the table is not level, so that the cart, upon becoming a projectile, has a sight upward launch angle. How would the true value of \\(B\\) compare to the value calculated by a student following your procedure and data analysis outlined above? The official solution to the questions is posted is here: https://youtu.be/L1oIsHMB1RQ?t=1751 Determining \\(B\\) (a) State the measurements that the student should make, and give each measurement a meaningful algebraic symbol. First I define the quantities, and derive expressions for the constants. I really answer this part \\(x_o\\) is the compression length \\(M\\) is the mass \\(v_o\\) is the horizontal launch speed off the flat table $$U = \\int F(x) dx = \\frac{B x_o&#94;4}{4}$$ $$ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{B x_o&#94;4}{4} &= \\frac{1}{2} mv_o&#94;2 \\\\ v_o&#94;2 &= \\frac{B x_o&#94;4}{2 m} \\\\ v_o \\cdot t &= R \\\\ h&= \\frac{1}{2} g t&#94;2 \\\\ t&#94;2 &= \\frac{2h}{g} = \\frac{R&#94;2}{v_o&#94;2} \\\\ \\frac{R&#94;2 g}{h} &= \\frac{B x_o&#94;4}{4}\\\\ R&#94;2 &= x_o&#94;4\\cdot \\frac{B\\cdot h}{4g} \\end{aligned} $$ $$ B = \\frac{R&#94;2 g m}{x_o&#94;4 h} $$ So, varying \\(x_o\\) and measuring the range, \\(R\\) , we can determine \\(B\\) . From data to \\(B\\) (b) Describe the procedure that the student should follow in order to make the measurements necessary to accomplish the student's purpose. Plotting \\(R&#94;2\\) vs \\(x_o&#94;4\\) the slope will be \\(B\\cdot h/4g\\) . Or better yet, plot \\(\\log(R)\\) vs \\(\\log(x_o)\\) . $$ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{R&#94;2 g}{h} &= \\frac{B x_o&#94;4}{4} \\\\ R&#94;2 &= x_o&#94;4\\cdot \\frac{B\\cdot h}{4g} \\\\ 2\\log(R) &= 4\\log(x_o) + \\log\\left(\\frac{B\\cdot h}{4g}\\right) \\end{aligned} $$ so the intercept will be \\(\\log\\left(\\frac{B\\cdot h}{4g}\\right)\\) . Verifying/Determining the form of the Force (c) Explain how the student should use the measurements in order to accomplish the student's purpose. Explicitly explain how the relationship between \\(F\\) and \\(x\\) can be tested and the value of \\(B\\) determined. The slope of the line from \\(\\log(R)\\) vs \\(\\log(x_o)\\) will determine the power of the spring energy function. Slope of \\(4\\) will confirm the \\(x&#94;3\\) form of the force. The Ramp and the Official (Incorrect) Solution (d) Suppose that the table is not level, so that the cart, upon becoming a projectile, has a sight upward launch angle. How would the true value of \\(B\\) compare to the value calculated by a student following your procedure and data analysis outlined above? This is where the official solution goes off the rails. He states that, If launch angle is a little bit up, the value of the range [ \\(R\\) in my notation, \\(D\\) in theirs] will be a little bit farther than they ideally would have been, so if you get a farther distance \\(R\\) than you should have gotten, then you would get a higher \\(B\\) . Hidden in this solution, but one not stated in the problem, is an assumption which we'll discuss later. We continue our solution of the ramp projectile. The range launched from a height \\(h\\) at an angle \\(\\theta\\) is ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_of_a_projectile ), $$ R_1=\\frac{v&#94;2}{2g} \\left(1+\\sqrt{1+\\frac{2gh}{v&#94;2\\sin&#94;2(\\theta)}}\\right)\\sin(2\\theta) $$ this form doesn't look much like the flat-table range, $$ \\begin{aligned} R_o&#94;2 &= \\frac{2 v_o&#94;2 h}{g} \\\\ R_o &= v_o \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{2h}{g}} \\end{aligned} $$ but you can show that they are the same in the limit \\(\\theta\\rightarrow 0\\) , $$ \\begin{aligned} R_1&=\\frac{v&#94;2}{2g} \\left(1+\\sqrt{1+\\frac{2gh}{v&#94;2\\sin&#94;2(\\theta)}}\\right)\\sin(2\\theta) \\\\ &\\sim \\frac{v&#94;2}{2g} \\left(1+\\sqrt{1+\\frac{2gh}{v&#94;2 \\theta&#94;2}}\\right)\\cdot 2\\theta \\\\ &\\sim \\frac{v&#94;2}{2g} \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2gh}{v&#94;2 \\theta&#94;2}}\\right)\\cdot 2\\theta \\\\ &=v \\sqrt{\\frac{2 h}{g}} \\end{aligned} $$ which matches the form of \\(R_o\\) . It's not obvious that \\(R_1\\) is an increasing function of \\(\\theta\\) , as stated in the solution (e.g. angle goes up, the range goes up) but numerically it is easy to demonstrate, B = 2 # true value x0 = 1.1 m = 0.01 h = 20 g = 10 θ = linspace ( 0.001 , 60 , 100 ) U = B * x0 ** 4 / 4 KE = U v = sqrt ( KE * 2 / m ) R0 = sqrt ( v ** 2 * 2 * h / g ) * ones ( len ( θ )) R1 = v ** 2 / 2 / g * ( 1 + sqrt ( 1 + 2 * g * h / v ** 2 / sin ( radians ( θ )) ** 2 )) * sin ( radians ( 2 * θ )) θ_at_max = arcsin ( sqrt ( 2 ) * v * sqrt ( 1 / ( g * h + v ** 2 )) / 2 ) θ_at_max2 = arcsin ( 1 / sqrt ( 2 ) * 1 / sqrt ( 1 + 2 * g * h * m / B / x0 ** 4 )) B_est0 = R0 ** 2 * g * m / ( x0 ** 4 * h ) B_est1 = R1 ** 2 * g * m / ( x0 ** 4 * h ) figure ( figsize = ( 16 , 6 )) subplot ( 1 , 2 , 1 ) plot ( θ , R0 , label = 'No Ramp' ) plot ( θ , R1 , label = 'With Ramp' ) vlines ( degrees ( θ_at_max ), * ylim (), ls = ':' ) vlines ( degrees ( θ_at_max2 ), * ylim (), ls = '--' , lw = 1 , color = 'r' ) ylabel ( 'Range' ) xlabel ( 'Angle' ) legend () subplot ( 1 , 2 , 2 ) plot ( θ , B_est0 , label = 'No Ramp' ) plot ( θ , B_est1 , label = 'With Ramp' ) vlines ( degrees ( θ_at_max ), * ylim (), ls = ':' ) ylabel ( '$B$' ) xlabel ( 'Angle' ) legend () As you can see, for small angle, the range increases with angle before decreasing again for steep angles. So far, so good. You wouldn't expect a student on a test to do the next parts, but I wasn't convinced that the assumption made in the solution held in all cases, or that there wasn't some range of parameters for which the simplistic \"angle goes up, range goes up\" would hold experimentally. So, I continued the analysis in as much deatil as I could. Maximum angle What is shown in the plot is that above some critical angle, the range starts going down. We expect that, because obviously if you had a ramp of \\(\\theta=90&#94;\\circ\\) you'd have no range. But what if that critical angle was somehow small, like \\(2&#94;\\circ\\) ? One might miss it experimentally if you were measuring, say, every \\(5&#94;\\circ\\) . But could this ever happen in this simple system? Let's see. The critical angle that gives the maximum range is determined analytically from, import sympy as sym v , g , h , θ , x_o , B , m = sym . symbols ( \"v g h θ x_o B m\" ) R1 = v ** 2 / 2 / g * ( 1 + sym . sqrt ( 1 + 2 * g * h / v ** 2 / sym . sin ( θ ) ** 2 )) * sym . sin ( 2 * θ ) display ( R1 ) \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{v&#94;{2} \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2 g h}{v&#94;{2} \\sin&#94;{2}{\\left(θ \\right)}} + 1} + 1\\right) \\sin{\\left(2 θ \\right)}}{2 g}\\) df = sym . diff ( R1 , θ ) soln = sym . solve ( sym . simplify ( df ), θ ) soln [-asin(sqrt(2)*v*sqrt(1/(g*h + v**2))/2), asin(sqrt(2)*v*sqrt(1/(g*h + v**2))/2)] sin_θ_at_max = sym . sqrt ( 2 ) * v * sym . sqrt ( 1 / ( g * h + v ** 2 )) / 2 display ( sin_θ_at_max ) \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{\\sqrt{2} v \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{g h + v&#94;{2}}}}{2}\\) The slope near \\(\\theta=0\\) is positive, as can be derived by $$ \\frac{dR_1}{d\\theta}=- \\frac{h \\sin{\\left(2 θ \\right)} \\cos{\\left(θ \\right)}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{2 g h}{v&#94;{2} \\sin&#94;{2}{\\left(θ \\right)}} + 1} \\sin&#94;{3}{\\left(θ \\right)}} + \\frac{v&#94;{2} \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2 g h}{v&#94;{2} \\sin&#94;{2}{\\left(θ \\right)}} + 1} + 1\\right) \\cos{\\left(2 θ \\right)}}{g} $$ Applying small angle approximation for the trigonometric functions (e.g. \\(\\sin\\theta\\sim \\theta\\) , \\(\\cos\\theta \\sim 1\\) ) we get $$ \\frac{dR_1}{d\\theta}=\\frac{v&#94;{2}}{g} $$ which is positive. Checking that this works numerically as well, B = 2 # true value x0 = 1.1 m = 0.01 h = 20 g = 10 θ = linspace ( 0.001 , 60 , 100 ) U = B * x0 ** 4 / 4 KE = U v = sqrt ( KE * 2 / m ) R0 = sqrt ( v ** 2 * 2 * h / g ) * ones ( len ( θ )) R1 = v ** 2 / 2 / g * ( 1 + sqrt ( 1 + 2 * g * h / v ** 2 / sin ( radians ( θ )) ** 2 )) * sin ( radians ( 2 * θ )) θ_at_max = arcsin ( sqrt ( 2 ) * v * sqrt ( 1 / ( g * h + v ** 2 )) / 2 ) θ_at_max2 = arcsin ( 1 / sqrt ( 2 ) * 1 / sqrt ( 1 + 2 * g * h * m / B / x0 ** 4 )) B_est0 = R0 ** 2 * g * m / ( x0 ** 4 * h ) B_est1 = R1 ** 2 * g * m / ( x0 ** 4 * h ) figure ( figsize = ( 16 , 6 )) subplot ( 1 , 2 , 1 ) plot ( θ , R0 , label = 'No Ramp' ) plot ( θ , R1 , label = 'With Ramp' ) x = radians ( θ [: 30 ]) m = v ** 2 / g b = R0 [ 0 ] y = m * x + b plot ( θ [: 30 ], y , 'c--' , label = 'Small Angle Approx' ) vlines ( degrees ( θ_at_max ), * ylim (), ls = ':' ) vlines ( degrees ( θ_at_max2 ), * ylim (), ls = '--' , lw = 1 , color = 'r' ) ylabel ( 'Range' ) xlabel ( 'Angle' ) legend () subplot ( 1 , 2 , 2 ) plot ( θ , B_est0 , label = 'No Ramp' ) plot ( θ , B_est1 , label = 'With Ramp' ) vlines ( degrees ( θ_at_max ), * ylim (), ls = ':' ) ylabel ( '$B$' ) xlabel ( 'Angle' ) legend () Given the symmetry, the point where the range starts decreasing with angle is at twice this angle. Subsituting in the launch speed for the flat table, \\(v_o&#94;2 = \\frac{B x_o&#94;4}{2 m}\\) , we get something interesting. sin_θ_at_max . subs ( v , sym . sqrt ( B * x_o ** 4 / 2 / m )) . simplify () \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{\\sqrt{2} v \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{g h + v&#94;{2}}}}{2}\\) yielding, $$ \\sin \\theta_{\\rm max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2} \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{2 g h m}{B x_{o}&#94;{4}}}} $$ the point here is that, while technically true that the range is an increasing function of \\(\\theta\\) for small \\(\\theta\\) , the turning point can be made arbitrarily small in certain parameter regions (e.g. small \\(B\\) , small \\(x_o\\) , large \\(m\\) , etc...). For instance, B = 2 # true value x0 = 0.1 m = 0.01 h = 20 g = 10 θ = linspace ( 0.001 , 3 , 100 ) U = B * x0 ** 4 / 4 KE = U v = sqrt ( KE * 2 / m ) R0 = sqrt ( v ** 2 * 2 * h / g ) * ones ( len ( θ )) R1 = v ** 2 / 2 / g * ( 1 + sqrt ( 1 + 2 * g * h / v ** 2 / sin ( radians ( θ )) ** 2 )) * sin ( radians ( 2 * θ )) θ_at_max = arcsin ( sqrt ( 2 ) * v * sqrt ( 1 / ( g * h + v ** 2 )) / 2 ) θ_at_max2 = arcsin ( 1 / sqrt ( 2 ) * 1 / sqrt ( 1 + 2 * g * h * m / B / x0 ** 4 )) B_est0 = R0 ** 2 * g * m / ( x0 ** 4 * h ) B_est1 = R1 ** 2 * g * m / ( x0 ** 4 * h ) figure ( figsize = ( 16 , 6 )) subplot ( 1 , 2 , 1 ) plot ( θ , R0 , label = 'No Ramp' ) plot ( θ , R1 , label = 'With Ramp' ) x = radians ( θ [: 30 ]) m = v ** 2 / g b = R0 [ 0 ] y = m * x + b plot ( θ [: 30 ], y , 'c--' , label = 'Small Angle Approx' ) vlines ( degrees ( θ_at_max ), * ylim (), ls = ':' ) vlines ( degrees ( θ_at_max2 ), * ylim (), ls = '--' , lw = 1 , color = 'r' ) ylabel ( 'Range' ) xlabel ( 'Angle' ) legend () subplot ( 1 , 2 , 2 ) plot ( θ , B_est0 , label = 'No Ramp' ) plot ( θ , B_est1 , label = 'With Ramp' ) vlines ( degrees ( θ_at_max ), * ylim (), ls = ':' ) ylabel ( '$B$' ) xlabel ( 'Angle' ) legend () So the claim that \"range increases with angle\" could be missed experimentally if the turning point is smaller than the ramp angle. To the person making the measurement, the range would decrease with angle. Still, technically, that claim is true...assuming the same launch speed. The primary assumption This brings us to the real problem with the given solution: the launch speed for the ramp case is not the same as the flat case . The spring gives the same amount to the kinetic energy, but it does so by having the block move up the ramp as the spring expands. Thus, the total kinetic energy of the block upon launch depends on the angle, $$ \\begin{aligned} U&= \\frac{B x_o&#94;4}{4} \\\\ {\\rm KE}_{\\rm flat} &= U \\\\ {\\rm KE}_{\\rm ramp} &= U - mgx_o\\sin(\\theta) \\end{aligned} $$ This leads to a range equation like the one above for \\(R_1\\) , but with an angle-dependent speed. We'll call this range \\(R_2\\) . ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_of_a_projectile ), $$ \\begin{aligned} R_1&=\\frac{v&#94;2}{2g} \\left(1+\\sqrt{1+\\frac{2gh}{v&#94;2\\sin&#94;2(\\theta)}}\\right)\\sin(2\\theta)\\\\ R_2&=\\frac{v_o&#94;2-2 g x_o\\sin \\theta}{2g} \\left(1+\\sqrt{1+\\frac{2gh}{\\left(v_o&#94;2-2 g x_o\\sin \\theta\\right)\\sin&#94;2(\\theta)}}\\right)\\sin(2\\theta) \\end{aligned} $$ which is a whole lot messier, and the slope is difficult to attain analytically. Numerically however, it is easy to see the effect. Depending on the parameters, the range could increase or decrease with angle . Here's an example with increasing with angle.

A hidden assumption -- that the launch speed is unaffected by the ramp -- would have made it much better and avoided any possible complications. However it's not a great assumption given the way the table and block are set up -- there is definitely a gravitational component to energy picked up along the ramp. Without this simplifying assumption the effect is much more complicated.","tags":"science","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2020/Aug/03/a-simple-physics-problem-gets-messy/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2020/Aug/03/a-simple-physics-problem-gets-messy/"},{"title":"Skepticism and Dubious Medical Procedures","text":"In my discussion with Jonathan McLatchie on the Still Unbelievable podcast , I said that there hasn't been a verified miracle claim even since Hume's essay on miracles.

South Med J . 2010 Sep;103(9):864-9 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20686441/ These three kept popping up again and again. The journals have dubious standards, and the authors work for the same institution ( https://www.globalmri.org/about ). On their website there is the following request: \"We're always looking for new testimonies. Do you have a testimony that is medically verified?\". Could you imagine a similar claim written about, say, a homeopathic remedy for cancer? If you took our remedy, and improved, we want to hear from you. Otherwise, not. Regardless of the contents of the specific studies, this sort of fishing for positive results is thoroughly unscientific and casts significant doubt on any results from this institution. My suspicions were confirmed going to http://sciencebasedmedicine.org (a great resource) where they have an article about the 3rd study in the list above: https://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/proximal-intercessory-prayer/ Bottom line, this study has numerous, basic scientific problems with it and the results cannot be trusted. I find that argument that a deity is better able to heal when the person asking them to do so is physically close to the person they are praying for absurd, lame, and convenient. It is a nice excuse to unblind the protocol, and nothing else – a way of generating false-positive results. So the process for collecting subjects used by these authors and supported by their institution, in addition to their experimental design, is constructed with the sole purpose of bypassing the methods of science. I was particularly surprised when I dug into the first study, went into their supplemental information, and saw a nice timeline of events ( emphasis mine ): […] June 14 1960 Complete Neurological Examination Completely normal except for macular degeneration \"cause undetermined\" 1971 Examination confirms \" legal blindness\" Recording of Visual Acuities - are consistent with legal blindness. No glasses recommended. Degeneration and scaring (sic) of macula in both eyes 1971-1974 Record of a series of Visual Acuities Visual Acuities consistent with legal blindness until record of 1974 1/29/71 Visual Acuity Right Eye- Finger Count Left Eye - Hand motion- All without glasses 1-18-72 Right Eye - Hand Motion, Left Eye - Hand Motion 6-14-74 Right Eye - 20/100-1 Left Eye - 20/100-2 All (above) without glasses 1972 Learned to use a cane and read braille.

October 16, 2001 Return Visit. Treatment for Dry Eyes Provided October 3, 2012. Cataract surgery of right eye Etc… So, the time between the prayer and the eye exam is…29 years! This is \"instantaneous resolution\"? Essentially, we're taking this patient's word that their eyesight improved after prayer, but the authors (or anyone else) didn't bother to test it for nearly 30 years. This level of incompetence, poor design, and digging for positive results is staggering. This is not the way one confirms medical claims. The second study seems at least a bit better, but with no controls, and knowing that the authors have a history of ludicrously bad design leaves me unconvinced. What I have tried to convey here is the process for investigating claims. You look at the originals, you examine methods and possible ways the authors could have (deliberately or not) biased the results. This is why we have blinding processes for medical experiments, and controls. Otherwise you can always fall victim to false positives and rare one-off events. We know that medical conditions can mysteriously improve (biology is complex and not entirely understood), so if you want to show your method of treatment actually works you do need to follow reasonable, skeptical procedures established by science. It's certainly hard to do this, takes more time and work, but there is good reason why we trust science. The lazy procedures of these authors -- including a self-proclaimed fishing for positive results -- is at best a cop-out and at worst a dishonest attempt to peddle bogus treatments.","tags":"religion","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2020/Jul/09/skepticism-and-dubious-medical-procedures/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2020/Jul/09/skepticism-and-dubious-medical-procedures/"},{"title":"Something Satisfying About Building Pelican Themes","text":"Pelican is a Python package for developing static websites. I started out my blog with Wordpress and then toyed with Wix and Weebly. But I found I didn't like the idea of a company holding my content -- if that company suddenly started to charge for the services, or disappeared altogether I didn't want my information caught in the middle. I also liked the control that a static site builder, like Pelican gives you. Finally, I like working in Markdown for my blog content (and most of my other content as well). There are a lot of themes for Pelican to choose from, and although I have used some before I find them looking a little dated. So for the past few designs of this website what I've done is head over to Colorlibs Free Web Templates and find a template that looks good, like Elen , Miniblog , or Philosophy . For good measure, get a pelican theme to help with comparisons, something like Plummage . Make sure to have the Creating Pelican Themes site handy! After that, it's pretty straightforward to port the web template over to a pelican theme -- but I still do a lot of trial and error! I think the satisfying parts of the developing a Pelican theme is to see years of articles instantly look like new. For example, in the Philosophy template index.html there is this snippet which presents the summary of a blog article, < article class = \"masonry__brick entry format-standard\" data-aos = \"fade-up\" > < div class = \"entry__thumb\" > < a href = \"single-standard.html\" class = \"entry__thumb-link\" > < img src = \"images/thumbs/masonry/lamp-400.jpg\" srcset = \"images/thumbs/masonry/lamp-400.jpg 1x, images/thumbs/masonry/lamp-800.jpg 2x\" alt = \"\" > </ a > </ div > < div class = \"entry__text\" > < div class = \"entry__header\" > < div class = \"entry__date\" > < a href = \"single-standard.html\" > December 15, 2017 </ a > </ div > < h1 class = \"entry__title\" >< a href = \"single-standard.html\" > Just a Standard Format Post. </ a ></ h1 > </ div > < div class = \"entry__excerpt\" > < p > Lorem ipsum Sed eiusmod esse aliqua sed incididunt aliqua incididunt mollit id et sit proident dolor nulla sed commodo est ad minim elit reprehenderit nisi officia aute incididunt velit sint in aliqua... </ p > </ div > < div class = \"entry__meta\" > < span class = \"entry__meta-links\" > < a href = \"category.html\" > Design </ a > < a href = \"category.html\" > Photography </ a > </ span > </ div > </ div > </ article > <!-- end article --> This is repeated once for many different articles, making for a long index.html file. In the pelican theme, the index.html loops over all of the articles and generates this long list using Jinja syntax, {% for article in articles_page.object_list %} < article class = \"masonry__brick entry format-standard\" data-aos = \"fade-up\" > < div class = \"entry__thumb\" > < a href = \"{{ SITEURL }}/{{ article.url }}\" class = \"entry__thumb-link\" > {% if article.image %} < img src = \"{{ SITEURL }}/images/{{ article.image }}\" > {% else %} < img src = \"{{ SITEURL }}/images/default.png\" > {% endif %} </ a > </ div > < div class = \"entry__text\" > < div class = \"entry__header\" > < div class = \"entry__date\" > < a href = \"{{ SITEURL }}/{{ article.url }}\" > {{ article.locale_date }} </ a > </ div > < h1 class = \"entry__title\" >< a href = \"{{ SITEURL }}/{{ article.url }}\" > {{ article.title }} {%if article.subtitle %} < small > {{ article.subtitle }} </ small > {% endif %} </ a ></ h1 > </ div > < div class = \"entry__excerpt\" > < p > {{ article.summary}} </ p > </ div > < div class = \"entry__meta\" > < span class = \"entry__meta-links\" > < a href = \"{{ SITEURL }}/{{ article.category.url }}\" > {{ article.category }} </ a > </ span > </ div > </ div > </ article > <!-- end article --> {% endfor %} Notice the injection of Python here: a loop to generate the html variables, like article.date and article.category , to put in article-specific information if-statements to include option content, like subtitles if-statements to include default behavior, in case no image is given for example This provides a level of control that is hard to match. To make the theme, as shown in the docs, you need to just make the following files ├── static │ ├── css │ └── images └── templates ├── archives . html // to display archives ├── period_archives . html // to display time - period archives ├── article . html // processed for each article ├── author . html // processed for each author ├── authors . html // must list all the authors ├── categories . html // must list all the categories ├── category . html // processed for each category ├── index . html // the index ( list all the articles ) ├── page . html // processed for each page ├── tag . html // processed for each tag └── tags . html // must list all the tags . Can be a tag cloud . Starting from the free web template, I break off the parts that are included in all of the files and put it in base.html , copying the Jinja parts from a pelican theme.

An example that stores 4 lists of a SIR compartmental model would look like, t = 0 S = 100 I = 1 R = 0 β = 0.1 γ = 0.1 dt = 0.01 t_arr = [ t ] S_arr = [ S ] I_arr = [ I ] R_arr = [ R ] for t in arange ( 0 , 10 , dt ): dS = ( - β * S * I ) * dt dI = ( + β * S * I - γ * I ) * dt dR = ( + γ * I ) * dt S += dS I += dI R += dR t_arr . append ( t ) S_arr . append ( S ) I_arr . append ( I ) R_arr . append ( R ) t , S , I , R = array ( t_arr ), array ( S_arr ), array ( I_arr ), array ( R_arr ) plot ( t , S ) plot ( t , I ) Notice the repetition. I get the same pattern running through the values of a parameter, calculating a result, but then wanting to make a plot of the result vs the parameter. For the loop I have to seemingly choose between, param_arr = linspace ( 0 , 3 , 100 ) result_arr = [] for param in param_arr : result = some_calculation ( param ) result_arr . append ( result ) result_arr = array ( result_arr ) plot ( param_arr , result_arr ) Or param_arr = [] result_arr = [] for param in linspace ( 0 , 3 , 100 ): result = some_calculation ( param ) result_arr . append ( result ) param_arr . append ( param ) result_arr = array ( result_arr ) param_arr = array ( param_arr ) plot ( param_arr , result_arr ) Or param_arr = linspace ( 0 , 3 , 100 ) result_arr = zeros ( len ( param_arr )) for i , param in enumerate ( param_arr ): result = some_calculation ( param ) result_arr [ i ] = result plot ( param_arr , result_arr ) The first two solutions seem to have a lot of repetition, and two variables for every one I want to save. The last one seems a bit ugly, and forces me to remember to have an index variable (enumerate or counter), and won't work if I don't know the sizes ahead of time. I'd love to know if there is a standard solution to this common pattern. Here's one that I came up with, which I don't think it optimum but at least solves the immediate problem.

Michael Straczynski (or jms ) has had on me. My first introduction to him was in the TV series Babylon 5 in the 1990's while I was in graduate school. The series connected with me on many levels including the attention to correct physics, story telling with actual consequences for the characters, a respect for multiple philosophies of life, and a planned story arc (decades before Game of Thrones). In his own words, \"As much as B5 was about exploration , wars, and the rise and fall of empires, at its center were issues of personal choice, the consequences that result from those choices, and our willingness to accept responsibility for those consequences.\" Since then I have followed him through World War Z, Thor, and Sense 8 as well as his excellent Screenwriting book but Babylon 5 is something I keep returning to. It's like returning home. Reading his autobiography, Becoming Superman , I was again struck by the life lessons he communicates through his personal story. If there was a person set up to be a total failure it would be J. Michael Straczynski . His description of his childhood reads like a manual for how to not raise children. Each time the reader thinks it can't get any worse --- it does. It was was Straczynski's single-minded pursuit to be the opposite of his parents and be more like Superman that saved him from an almost inevitable disaster. Through his example, jms communicates clear positive messages. Be true to yourself, communicate only truth to others, stand up for the misfortunes of anyone, never compromise your principles even at personal expense and realize that you can choose differently than your past might set you up for. I can't recommend this book more. It reads as a mystery novel, an inspirational self-help book, and a devotional reading to the process of writing and life all rolled into one.","tags":"articles","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2020/Jan/07/becoming-superman-a-review/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2020/Jan/07/becoming-superman-a-review/"},{"title":"Probability of the Resurrection","text":"In a recent discussion about the use of probability in a religious context I saw another poor job of a calculation of the Resurrection (I had read several others that had serious problems). I then felt that it would be good to sketch out how it should be done. The goal here is not to come up with a single number, but to have a structure which invites discussion. A smaller problem We are restricting the problem to the smallest possible case to most easily see the form that the calculation takes when done properly. The problem is A friend of yours flipped a coin three times and got heads three times in a row. Would this be good evidence for your friend having a coin with two heads compared to, say, a typical coin with 1 heads and 1 tails? Here we have 2 models ( \\(M_1\\) , say, is for the 1-headed coin model and \\(M_2\\) is for the 2-headed coin model), and some observed data (heads, heads, heads in 3 flips). We want to know the probability of each of the models given the data. In math notation we use the vertical bar, \\(|\\) , as the symbol for \"given\". The \"data\" is summarized as \"H H H\" for three observed heads flips. So we want to obtain, $$ P(M_1 | \\text{H H H}) \\text{ and } P(M_2 | \\text{H H H}) $$ following Bayes theorem, we write the top of Bayes equation as $$ P(M_1 | \\text{H H H}) \\sim P(\\text{H H H}| M_1) \\times P(M_1) $$ and $$ P(M_2 | \\text{H H H}) \\sim P(\\text{H H H}| M_2) \\times P(M_2) $$ Before continuing, let me point out a few things. First, I'm not using equals here, but the \\(\\sim\\) sign to denote that I'm writing just the top part of the equation first. I'll add these two things up to get the bottom of Bayes in the next step. I do it as a two-step process to make it easier to write down (i.e. it formats better in text) and to help when we generalize to more than 2 models, where Bayes can get a bit unwieldy. The term \\(P(\\text{H H H}| M_1)\\) is the probability we'd see the data if we knew (i.e. we're given) that model 1 is true. Since \\(M_1\\) is from a fair coin, we get 1/2 probability for each head independently and we don't have any extra counting term, so we'd get the \\(P(\\text{H H H}| M_1)=\\frac{1}{2}\\times\\frac{1}{2}\\times\\frac{1}{2}\\) . The term \\(P(\\text{H H H}| M_2)\\) is the probability we'd see the data if we knew (i.e. we're given) that model 2 is true. Since \\(M_2\\) is from a rigged two-headed coin, we get a probability of 1 for each head so we'd get the \\(P(\\text{H H H}| M_2)=1\\times 1\\times 1\\) . The terms \\(P(M_1)\\) and \\(P(M_2)\\) are the prior probabilities of the model - how much we should believe them before we saw the data. This is probably the most contentious point, and worth dwelling on. It's not 50%, just because there are two possibilities. Do we even know if a two-headed coin exists? Have you ever seen one? The two models are not symmetric. Turns out I have seen one! There's one in my desk, which I love to bring out to fool my students. :-) It was found by accident with my daughter going through all of our loose change. I have never seen one since, but if we just took my house as an example, it's no bigger than a 1/100 of all the quarters. This can inform the prior as \\(P(M_1) = 0.99\\) and \\(P(M_2) = 0.01\\) . I would guess that this is a huge over estimate for the \\(P(M_2)\\) but it's good to run with. Getting back to our probabilities, we calculate the top terms of Bayes, add them up, and then go back to divide each by that total. Thus we get: $$ \\begin{align} P(M_1 | \\text{H H H}) &\\sim P(\\text{H H H}| M_1) \\times P(M_1) = \\frac{1}{2}\\times\\frac{1}{2}\\times\\frac{1}{2}\\times 0.99 = 0.124 \\\\ P(M_2 | \\text{H H H}) &\\sim P(\\text{H H H}| M_2) \\times P(M_2) = 1\\times 1\\times 1\\times 0.01 = 0.01 \\end{align} $$ (adding them up) \\(T=0.124 + 0.01 = 0.134\\) finally getting (notice the equals now) $$ \\begin{align} P(M_1 | \\text{H H H}) &=0.124/T = 0.124/0.134=0.925 \\\\ P(M_2 | \\text{H H H}) &=0.01/T=0.01/0.134 = 0.075 \\end{align} $$ So, finally, we can have good reason -- by a long shot -- to not believe that the person has a 2-headed coin. Although we have a nearly \\(8\\times\\) increase in the probability of that model, \\(M_2\\) , given the observed data of 3 heads, this doesn't bring our confidence up to the level of belief - you'd need more data for that. This problem has exactly the same structure as the problem under consideration, trying to find the probability of the resurrection given the data we have and the number of possible models. The problem at hand - the probability of the Resurrection The proper way to set the problem up, like the coin, is the following. First, we start with the different models: \\(R\\) = Resurrection happened \\(M\\) = Resurrection story made up entirely \\(V\\) = Resurrection story incited by visions from early apostles and embellished etc... and then the math follows just like the example above, data = texts of gospels and Paul (and their history) \\(P(R | \\text{data}) \\sim P(\\text{data} | R) \\times P(R)\\) \\(P(M | \\text{data}) \\sim P(\\text{data} | M) \\times P(M)\\) \\(P(V | \\text{data}) \\sim P(\\text{data} | V) \\times P(V)\\) .... [insert more models if you'd like] then add up to \\(T = \\ldots\\) , and divide all terms, just like the coin. Arguments over priors can ensue, but I think it would be fair to say that \\(P(M)>P(V) \\gg P(R)\\) . Although one might question this order (e.g. arguing that visions are more common than story construction) it is certainly true that resurrections are far less common than stories or visions. How often do we see resurrections? How often do we see God raising someone from the dead? How often have we heard claims of people being raised from the dead, from God or otherwise? These very simple questions bring the prior for the Resurrection way down. The theist will typically counter with something like \"I agree that resurrections through natural processes are extremely unlikely, but if there is a God he could easily make resurrections through supernatural causes likely.\" I'll deal specifically with this objection in detail below but at this point the term \\(P(R)\\) doesn't presuppose any mechanisms - it is just the probability of a resurrection before seeing any data and it should be agreed that this is much lower than visions or stories. Beyond the prior, we note that terms like \\(P(\\text{data} | R)\\) have to balance both the positive claims and negative claims. For example, we might say that this term is quite high from the positive claims -- if the Resurrection actually happened then it easily explains the stories of seeing Jesus afterward. However, there are things that we probably should have seen -- but don't -- if the Resurrection actually happened. Some includes the lack of an account of Roman stolen-body litigation (as would have been done to the disciples), the fact that Paul doesn't mention the empty tomb, and the guards at the tomb are only mentioned in Matthew are not mentioned in Mark, Luke, John, or even Paul. These negative claims are easily explained with the other two models but are not easily explained from the Resurrection model making \\(P(\\text{data} | R)\\) much lower than is generally communicated. Supernatural causation Now, what about the claim that the low priors are mitigated by the issue of God supernaturally raising Jesus? Here is where it gets interesting. If you want to add the possibility of God raising Jesus supernaturally from the dead we can do this with a process called marginalization , which is a fancy term for adding up all of the possibilities. Mathematically it looks like the following, First define some symbols, \\(+G\\) = God \\(+S\\) = Supernatural action \\(-G\\) = no God \\(-S\\) = natural action We can then draw out the probability terms (which don't mention any specific methods of resurrections) into several terms, each for a different method, and then apply Bayes' rule yielding $$ \\begin{align} P(R | \\text{data}) =& P(R, +G,+S | \\text{data}) + P(R, -G,+S| \\text{data}) + P(R, +G,-S| \\text{data}) + P(R, -G,-S| \\text{data})\\\\ \\sim & P(\\text{data}|R,+G,+S)P(R|+G,+S)P(+S|+G)P(+G) + \\\\ \\nonumber &P(\\text{data}|R,-G,+S)P(R|-G,+S)P(+S|-G)P(-G) + \\\\ \\nonumber &P(\\text{data}|R,+G,-S)P(R|+G,-S)P(-S|+G)P(+G) + \\\\ \\nonumber &P(\\text{data}|R,-G,-S)P(R|-G,-S)P(-S|-G)P(-G) \\end{align} $$ This messy result lets us look at individual terms to see where we might have to examine the data more closely. Theists state that terms like \\(P(R|-G,-S)\\) are small (unlikely resurrection given no God and only natural action), and I'll grant you that. How about \\(P( R | +G, -S)\\) or, in words, why couldn't God have done the resurrection naturally? How about $P( R | -G, +S) $ or, in words, couldn't Satan or Stephen Fry's evil God have done the resurrection supernaturally? How have theists ruled these out? Suddenly, by opening up some specific alternatives, one needs to follow all of those alternatives -- and their inverses -- through the entire calculation. You then have to provide evidence for God's supposed actions ( \\(P(+S|+G)\\) and \\(P(-S|+G)\\) ) reading his inscrutable plan. You also have to demonstrate that there are not other supernatural agents at play, and that it is likely that God is the one acting. Given that theists have yet to provide any way of testing supernatural claims at all it seems like a big feat. In short, by introducing supernatural causation into the mix, theists have made their life harder -- not easier.","tags":"religion","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2019/Sep/03/probability-of-the-resurrection/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2019/Sep/03/probability-of-the-resurrection/"},{"title":"Unbelievable?

This book explores the role of rational thought as described by the rules of probability applied to the ideas in traditional religious discourse. It provides a basic introduction to the rules of probability for those who want a refresher and then proceeds to apply those rules to standard arguments for the existence of God, the resurrection of Jesus, the evidence for miracles, and the concept of faith. Through this exploration, a common thread of analysis is woven to describe notions of simplicity in explanations, independence of evidence, and the common cognitive biases we all share.

Then E. T. Jaynes showed me that probability forms the foundation of rationality itself. Remarkably very few axioms are needed to constrain the mathematical forms necessary for rational thought and the outcome turns out to be Laplace's original formulation . What follows are the axioms so that you can appreciate them as much as I. The paper From Laplace to Supernova SN1987A: Bayesian Inference In Astrophysics by Tom Loredo is an excellent and complete guide to this, including quantitative examples. Jaynes prefers the word desiderata for this list - a collection of things needed or wanted - but they function the same as axioms of the analysis - unproven foundational statements as a basis for a derived system - and I prefer to use that terminology. Whatever you'd like to name them, here they are: Degrees of plausibility are represented by real numbers . This is a choice of practicality. Perhaps there is some value in probability represented with complex numbers , but so far no useful generalization has been found to my knowledge. Qualitative consistency with common sense . Specifically, the system must be consistent with standard Boolean logic - the logic of syllogisms and deductive logic. This is not a generic call to \" common sense \" to base the system on, but rather the short-hand informal speech that Jaynes likes to use. Internal consistency . If a conclusion can be reasoned out in more than one way then every possible way must yield the same result. Propriety . We must take into account all of the information provided that is relevant to the question. Equivalent states consistency . Equivalent states of knowledge must be represented by equivalent plausibility assignments. To quote Jaynes: At this point, most students are surprised to learn that our search for desiderata is at an end. The above conditions, it turns out, uniquely determine the rules by which [we] must reason; i.e. there is only one set of mathematical operations for manipulating plausibilities which has all these properties. From these axioms, we can derive, the sum and product rules of probability, which describe the process of combining bits of knowledge Bayes Rule, which describes the structure of learning from evidence the marginalization rule, where model simplicity is attributed to fewer adjustable parameters deductive logic, the limit as the probabilities go to 0 and 1 the dangers of either/or thinking and much more! An important consequence of the derivation is that any system which disagrees with it must violate one or more of the axioms listed. The entire approach shows that probability theory is far more fundamental than is typically appreciated.","tags":"math","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2019/Jun/16/probability-its-not-just-about-the-math/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2019/Jun/16/probability-its-not-just-about-the-math/"},{"title":"Why Christian Apologetics is Faulty Science and Faulty History","text":"In this episode I join Andrew and Matthew to discuss The Fine Tuning Argument, The Second Law of Thermodynamics, contingency, evidence for the Christian claim of a historical resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth, and other topics found in Justin Brierley's book Unbelievable?: Why After Ten Years of Talking With Atheists, I'm Still a Christian.

I haven't seen a talk lately which has transformed my thinking on a topic as much as this one. To summarize, Gilbert observes that even with noted creative \"geniuses\" the process of creation is uneven. The creative juices seem fickle even for the accomplished and the perception from others (and even themselves) is that these people have failed when they struggle to create again even after major successes. Gilbert reminds us that this attitude toward creation is new to the enlightenment, and that prior to that the \"genius\" was an external being which visited a person and could leave or be uncooperative. That the word \"genius\" and the word \"genie\" have obvious linguistic parallels was something I never noticed until this observation. People who externalize the creative influence with a genie or muse easily explain why they can be amazingly creative at one moment and be stuck in the next — the muse simply is not there. In the Enlightenment, we rid ourselves of the superstition of these external agents and the \"genius\" was tied to the individual — and thus also the responsibility for being \"stuck\" was tied to the individual too. By eliminating the muse we place a burden on the individual which may be unjustified. Gilbert speaks about the value of conversing with this external agent, saying things like \"Listen you, thing, you and I both know that if this book isn't brilliant that is not entirely my fault, right? Because you can see that I am putting everything I have into this, I don't have any more than this. If you want it to be better, you've got to show up and do your part of the deal. But if you don't do that, you know what, the hell with it. I'm going to keep writing anyway because that's my job. And I would please like the record to reflect today that I showed up for my part of the job.\" Superstition and Stories So what is this \"muse\" or \"genie\" driving our creative energies? I am not a fan of superstitious thinking, but this presentation got me thinking about the value of the story itself. We are not in control of our creative output — it is the product of our genetic make-up and the entire history of our experiences. When we have one thought follow another, our brain is accessing memories and impressions that have been built up in a complex process over the years of our interactions with others and with the world. We can, as Gilbert says, control whether we show up for the work but we can't control what the next thought will be. Given that we lack control of the process where our best creative ideas come from it makes sense to not hold ourselves accountable for them. However, it is far too wordy to describe this situation to others (or even to ourselves) every time we experience a lack of creativity. Given that humans are inherently story-driven beings there is some value in the short-hand of describing this \"other\" as an external agent, an effect outside of our immediate control. One value of doing this is to refocus on the things for which we actually have control and to not burn needless psychological energy on the things we don't. There is a danger of believing these agents actually exist as external beings, even if they \"exist\" as those factors of our mental processes which are outside of direct control. Thinking this way, it makes clearer some of Jordan Peterson's otherwise obtuse religious-speak . Peterson latches onto religious metaphor and states that anyone asking if it is \"literally true\" is missing the point. Perhaps Peterson's \"God\" is a name given to his moral \"muse\", and to admit it doesn't exist is the same to him as accepting responsibility for thoughts and actions beyond his control. I still have to think through some of these issues but I do find it interesting how people lean on stories and short-cuts to help deal with life's challenges.","tags":"articles","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2019/May/15/useful-fictions/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2019/May/15/useful-fictions/"},{"title":"An Interesting Twist on the Gambler's Fallacy","text":"I was reminded of the Gambler's Fallacy in a recent post by Stephen Novella and thought of a twist on the fallacy that makes it a bit more subtle. The fallacy is defined, The gambler's fallacy, also known as the Monte Carlo fallacy or the fallacy of the maturity of chances, is the mistaken belief that, if something happens more frequently than normal during a given period, it will happen less frequently in the future (or vice versa). In situations where the outcome being observed is truly random and consists of independent trials of a random process, this belief is false. If you observe 5 heads in a row, for example, then the probability of another heads is still \\(p=0.5\\) . In other words it is not more (or less) likely to get a tails after a long string of heads in a row. There are however a couple of cases where this doesn't hold. 100 heads What happens if you observe someone flipping a coin and they achieve 100 heads in a row. Would you really think that the probability of another heads is still \\(p=0.5\\) ? Is it even rational to believe that? At some point, you would question the independence of trials assumption. You might think that the coin is rigged (two heads?) or that the flipping process is rigged (spinning the coin like a frisbee instead of end-over-end motion) or something else. The mathematics for it is pretty straightforward. Assume you have two models: \\(M_1\\) : the coin-flipping process is random, trials are independent, and the probability of each flip is \\(p=0.5\\) for heads \\(M_2\\) : the coin has two heads, so no matter what the flipping process is the probability of getting heads is \\(p=1\\) . and our data is \\(m\\) heads flips in a row $$ D \\equiv \\left\\{\\underbrace{H_1,H_2,H_3,\\cdots,H_m}_{\\mbox{$m$ flips}}\\right\\} $$ We are then interested in whether the \\(m+1\\) flip is a heads, or \\(P(H_{m+1}|D)\\) . Since we have two possible models which could give this outcome, we break this probability into a sum for each, $$ P(H_{m+1}|D) = P(H_{m+1}|D,M_1)P(M_1|D) + P(H_{m+1}|D,M_2)P(M_2|D) $$ Since in both models the history of flips makes no difference to the next flip we get \\begin{eqnarray} P(H_{m+1}|D,M_1) &=& P(H_{m+1}|M_1) = 0.5\\\\ P(H_{m+1}|D,M_2) &=& P(H_{m+1}|M_2) = 1 \\end{eqnarray} So, the bulk of the probability comes from the probability of each model given the data. Applying Bayes' Rule, we get \\begin{eqnarray} P(M_1|D) &\\sim& P(D|M_1)P(M_1)=\\frac{0.5&#94;m \\cdot P(M_1)}{T} \\\\ P(M_2|D) &\\sim& P(D|M_2)P(M_2)=\\frac{1&#94;m \\cdot P(M_2)}{T} \\end{eqnarray} where \\(T\\) is the total probability of the data and the probabilities \\(P(M_1)\\) and \\(P(M_2)\\) are the priors for Model 1 and Model 2, respectively. We can start figuring out the prior probability by thinking in the following way. Since we usually don't think a system is rigged unless we start seeing a strong pattern consistent with that, we expect that the prior for \\(M_2\\) should be much less than for \\(M_1\\) . Without loss of generality, we assign \\(P(M_1) = 1\\) and \\(P(M_2) = 10&#94;{-a}\\) . If \\(a=3\\) then Model 2 is 1000x less likely (before the data) than Model 1, if \\(a=6\\) then Model 2 is 1 million times less likely, etc... We consider that the coin might not be independent when the probabilities for the two models -- after the data -- become comparable. Each heads observation makes Model 1 a bit less likely and Model 2 a bit more so. In a picture (for the case of \\(a=6\\) ) we have Mathematically we have $$ \\frac{P(M_2|D)}{P(M_1|D)} = \\frac{10&#94;{-a}}{0.5&#94;m} \\gt 1 $$ which yields the number of flips, \\(m\\) , to overcome a prior against the two-headed coin, \\(a\\) , $$ m> \\frac{a}{\\log_{10} 2} $$ For \\(a=6\\) (or initially a million times less likely) then \\(m>19.9\\) flips is needed to overcome that level of initial skepticism. Alternating Results or Quasi-random processes The same sort of analysis can occur if instead of a string of heads we observe a perfectly oscillating sequence (H,T,H,T,H,T,...). This, of course, could be the result of a random process but if it continued long enough then even a low prior of a rigged system could be overcome. The same could occur if you happen to be observing a Sobol Sequence or some other quasi-random processes . These sequences are designed to be non-independent in order to be more likely to fill the space of numbers evenly. Thus, if there is a sequence of 5 heads in a row, then under a quasi-random process a tails is in fact more likely in these sequences as the \"fallacy\" warns us against. These processes have some use in sampling for simulations where you want to make sure to cover all the the values of the parameter space evenly and efficiently. Conclusion I am not arguing that the Gambler's Fallacy is wrong, nor am I arguing that we should think every case is rigged. I am further not suggesting that people are actually good at these problems - they aren't. We see patterns in random sequences and events all of the time, and perhaps we should be a bit more reticent to ascribe non-randomness to processes for which we have no evidence of a non-random influence. In other words, our priors for a rigged system should generally be quite low. However, there can be cases where the system is rigged and we should be open to that possibility as well.","tags":"math","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2019/Mar/24/an-interesting-twist-on-the-gamblers-fallacy/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2019/Mar/24/an-interesting-twist-on-the-gamblers-fallacy/"},{"title":"Book Review - \"Unbelievable?\" by Justin Brierley","text":"Structure of the Review As I finished this review it became apparent that there are two main audiences for what I wrote - those that have yet to read the book and those that have already read the book. Therefore I decided to break the review up into two parts, one for each audience. For those that have not yet read Unbelievable? Context I've been listening to this podcast for years and even had a project several years ago with the lofty goal of responding to each and every episode. I did not achieve the goal, unfortunately. The problem was two-fold: 1. There are too many episodes 2. Nearly every episode is so packed with interesting content that my responses were taking longer than a week to prepare, so I was always behind. The podcast is a model of how discussions can go, even when the topic is contentious. Justin Brierley is the epitome of civil. Like a good moderator, it isn't always clear where he stands on the issue - it's even easy to ignore the fact that he's a believer himself! He does an amazing job in the podcast of rephrasing what even his opponents state - skillfully steelmanning the entire time. The book, Unbelievable? Why After Ten Years of Talking with Atheists I'm Still a Christian has all the best of the podcast in book form. It's a plea for a return to civil discourse on hard topics. \"Having conversations as one of the most important things we do in life\" \"Many conversation descend into the equivalent of verbal hand grenades being lobbed over the barricades of our carefully erected worldviews.\" Brierley demonstrates how you can respect a position that you disagree with and how you can -- without fear -- present someone else's argument even better than they can. I can't help but think that this book was aptly timed for this age of quick sound-bites and tweets. We live in a culture where it seems to be acceptable to malign your opponent without addressing their concerns or characterize their positions in such uncharitable ways that everyone speaks past each other. It is a ray of light that this book - despite the fact that I disagree strongly with its conclusions - reaches across the aisle gently and respectfully with an invitation to engage in the discussion openly. It is for this reason, out of respect, that I take a thoughtful, thorough approach to this review. Structure of the Book After the first chapter on \"Creating Better Conversations,\" the book's chapters walk the reader through all of the standard arguments for God and Christianity, sprinkled with anecdotes from Brierley's interviews. The book reads very nicely and has a conversational tone, introducing the reader to some of Brierley's original reasons for believing - from personal experience and revelation - and many other reasons to support which belief that he admits came later along. The book is remarkably complete and as far as I can tell, hits all the major apologetics' points - including some arguments that have been circulating in the Christian community literally for thousands of years. Brierley explains the Cosmological Arguments and the Fine Tuning Arguments in the chapter \"God Makes Sense of Human Existence.\" The Moral Arguments, likewise, are addressed in the chapter \"God Makes Sense of Human Value.\" He continues with arguments from purpose, the existence of Jesus, the evidence for the Resurrection, and suffering. Brierley finishes the book with a pragmatic explanation of living in the \"Christian Story\" and the benefits of choosing to live in that way. For anyone not familiar with the standard arguments for Christianity, Unbelievable? is a great introduction and summary of the primary arguments. For anyone who cares about civil and intelligent dialog, this book is for you. For those that have read Unbelievable? If I am not convinced by these arguments and Brierley is where is the divide? I will hopefully address this question in the rest of this review. I break each of my responses into the appropriate topics, essentially following the order of the book, discussing where I disagree with Brierley's conclusions at many places. I must admit that most of the chapters present so much of all sides of the arguments that the book is unusually balanced for its genre. It also means that this review is quite a bit longer than I would do for other books. Personal Experience For Brierley, by his own admission, personal experience is the primary reason for his original conversion. He refers to a personal experience in a youth retreat in 1995, calling it a \"moment of surrender\" where God \"showed up,\" noting that most if not all Christians would probably relate to this. \"I suspect that something similar is true for most people who call themselves Christians. It's not that they can necessarily pinpoint a 'moment of surrender' like mine, but their faith is nevertheless grounded in an experience of God's presence in their lives, perhaps in some emotionally tangible way, or simply as a deep-down 'knowing' that has been there as long as they can remember.\" I've never had such an experience, at least not tangibly, so I can't address Brierley's experience directly. However, we have learned from science that personal experience that isn't accessible to others doesn't typically track reality - it tracks subjectivity. People have profound experiences quite often and then interpret these experiences in all sorts of ways. This does not mean that those interpretations are correct, even if the experiences themselves are real. It is only through an honest exploration of the possible explanations, through prediction and skepticism, that we can achieve something close to the truth. I don't think Brierley would disagree with this - which is why he goes to great pains to explore the evidence. Second Law of Thermodynamics \"My dad also said something else. As a scientist he found it intriguing that the emergence of life on our planet seems to disobey one of the fundamental laws of nature. The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that, when left to their own devices, all closed systems (such as our universe), will move towards increasing 'entropy' -- the scientific word for disorder.\" Every physicist will tell you why this is an incorrect statement - because the earth is not a closed system. Under the logic of this quote, even something like frozen ice would not be produced on the earth because it is a lower entropy state. I've had a bad experience with this particular argument in University. The correction to the argument is both easy to find. Further, unlike other such arguments, you won't find any disagreement with any physicist you ask. It is the fact that the answer is so easy to find and consistent with the experts that there really is no excuse left to keep using this argument. Even so, I have seen Christians use it even after being corrected . The claim is so outlandish, from a physical point of view, that if a scientist actually believed it, they would have to admit that a frozen pond (also a decrease in entropy) would be impossible. The claim presented in this quote represents a pervasive lack of imagination on the part of the theist where they seemingly can't wrap their brains around the idea that complexity can arise from natural processes. This lack of imagination infects not just this argument, but the fine tuning argument, other arguments from design, and even the moral argument. Fine Tuning Sean Carroll, an outspoken cosmologist from CalTech, says that the Fine Tuning Argument is the \"theist's best argument\" and it is well communicated in \" Unbelievable? .\" The problem is that, despite the confident claims of many theists, the physicists are not at all clear how much fine tuning there is or if there is any at all. The way fine tuning is demonstrated starts with noticing that there are some seemingly arbitrary constants in our physical laws (e.g. speed of light, expansion rate of the universe, etc...). These constants if varied independently lead to conditions where life as we know it couldn't form. The emphasis here is to point out the problems with making confident claims about these observations. the constants may be determined by other laws we don't know right now. This has happened already for the expansion rate of the universe, which can be specifically derived from Einstein's equations - and shown to not be fine-tuned. the constants may not be independent, so changing one may necessitate changing another by a specific amount negating the effect we don't understand the conditions necessary for life With these objections, it seems premature to make any strong statements about fine tuning even if you are convinced it is there. Something out of nothing It is telling, I think, that the primary scientific arguments for God rely on the fringes of the known science into the unknown. William Lane Craig makes a great deal out of the absurd notion of something \"popping into existence\" from nothing - and to allow even one instance of it would allow things like bicycles to appear out of nothing. However, he doesn't address Sean Carroll directly who shows that models of the origin of the universe have some things able to appear out of nothing and other things not. These models actually make predictions for things we may observe, e.g. correlations in the microwave background, values of the early universe entropy, etc... What predictions do the theistic models actually make about the properties of the observable universe? None to my knowledge. It is clear that science and religion are playing by different rules here. Contingent vs Necessary Brierley comments about the argument from contingency, \"I've been struck by the obvious yet remarkable fact that there is anything at all. [...] Like Leibniz, I can see that it's perfectly logically possible that there could have been nothing at all. I am not a philosopher and am unconvinced by words like contingent and necessary . For example, I do not see any support for the claim that there are necessary objects, or that a being or mind could satify the requirements to be necessary . Maybe the only things that can be necessary are things like laws of logic, and that objects don't fit that criterion. I don't know! But until these are actually demonstrated and not just asserted , all of the arguments based on them have no content. In the same way, perhaps the concept of \" nothing \" isn't well defined and can't manifest in reality, so the question \"why is there something rather than nothing\" is answered simply with \"because 'nothing' isn't realizable\". Further, \"There's nothing about our universe to suggest that it had to exist rather its existence is contingent. It needs an explanation of his existence.\" I would add as an analogy that there's nothing about our experience on the Earth to suggest that the Earth is round or that it orbits the sun. It may be logically possible to have a flat planet, but not physically realizable in our universe (note: the spherical nature of planets is due to the spherical form of the law of gravitation). Our intuitions do not always track the truth, and truth should be our goal. As a scientist, I am accustomed to cases of seemingly obvious things being false, and of seemingly impossible things being true irrespective of our intuitions. Thus, strictly philosophical arguments are not enough to demonstrate the existence of something. Language of the Universe Why is the universe written in the language of mathematics? Brierley says, For those who want to ask `Why?', atheism's only answer seems to be that it is a massive coincidence. I don't see it as a coincidence I see it as a requirement. In any universe that has any patterns at all such that life could possibly exist - no matter what form of life - then those living beings would discover those patterns as the \"mathematics\" of that universe. It doesn't surprise me that there are patterns in the universe, but I still agree with Brierley that it is an amazing thing that the universe exists at all. \"So does science provide iron-clad proof for God's existence? No. Could the scientific consensus change in the future? Of course it could. Is this all there is to say on the subject? Certainly not. The case for God is a cumulative one that reaches well beyond science...\" Although I can quibble about the use of \"proof\" here (science doesn't deal in proof, only evidence) I'd rather take the time to extend the notion of \"science\" to include things like history as well as the study of morality, which moves into the next chapters. Really, what I am thinking is that rational discourse combined with skeptical attitudes are the components that include science and these other topics. In the case of the universe existing, perhaps an \"I don't know\" is the best answer we have right now, until someone is imaginative enough to find a way to determine it. To posit the answer \"I know, and it is God\" requires a level of explanation and prediction far above what any theist seems able to give. Moral argument In discussing human value, Brierley writes: \"It was grim stuff, admittedly, but it was a moment which exposed the problem for atheists who affirm the subjective nature of morality but then find themselves in a bind when it comes to truly horrendous acts. They don't just feel wrong. They are wrong. Period. He concludes the chapter with, \"I have tried to persuade you of two things in this chapter. First, that humans have a real inherent worth and dignity that transcends a purely evolutionary story of how morality came to be. Second, if humans have such a value then it only makes sense if there is someone beyond nature who can assign them such value, the God who created them in his own image. I am not generally swayed by the moral argument for a few reasons. First, I think that much is made out the subjective/objective dichotomy that someone like Sam Harris already handles consistently. In The Moral Landscape , he is able to define morality as the concern for the suffering and well-being of conscious creatures which, even if done imperfectly, coincides well with all of the sorts of problems we associate with moral choices. In this way, he describes an objective basis for morality without resorting to outside agency. My second issue is that the supposed solution - \"God did it\" - fails the \"Euthyphro dilemma\" - the question whether something is good because God wills it or whether God wills it because it is good. In the former, we get the repugnant conclusion that if God commands murder it is necessarily good (the good of a dictator). In the latter, the good transcends God so we don't need God for the existence of the good. The only way out of this dilemma that I have ever heard is the claim that \"the standard of the Good is God's very nature\" (William Lane Craig) or something similar. This seems to me to be word games to define your way out of the problem. My final issue with the moral argument is that it seems to me that, like the argument from personal revelation, the argument itself relies on the intuitive notion that there are some things that are objectively wrong: things like murder and rape are objectively wrong, to deny this seems abhorrent, and everyone has this intuition. Since, in other contexts (e.g. flat unmoving Earth), we have already seen that our intuitions fail in many situations, is it possible that it is failing here and we just don't see it? To explore this line of thinking, one should notice that in the moral argument the usual extremes are always trotted out - murder and rape - and not something a bit more ambiguous. Since this argument holds a lot of emotional weight, perhaps we can explore this in a different way, and leave ourselves at least agnostic on this issue. We have here some models of the source of morality - and I am neither promoting or denying any of these: Model 1: an external agent has imprinted some specific objective standards on everyone (perhaps imperfectly, like the sense of sight is imperfect). Model 2: a naturalistic process is responsible for the perceived standard through evolution. Model 3: a naturalistic process is responsible for the standard (perceived or real) based on suffering/well being. There may be others, but let's stick to these for a second. To me, all three models explain the perception that murder and rape are objectively wrong. It would seem obvious from an evolutionary perspective that for social creatures, murder and rape would feel objectively wrong. These three models all predict that we would have some divergence on more subtle issues, although I think not to the same degree. Model 1 would further imply that even on these more subtle aspects of morality there should eventually be convergence - the moral status of same-sex couples, for example. Models 2 and 3 would imply that there would be huge cultural differences between groups on the more subtle questions. Given our observations, this would seem to be evidence against Model 1 and the moral argument for God. In either case, if you have Models 1-3, a scientist would require further predictions that would help us actually distinguish between an agent-imparted standard and one without, even when both are consistent with our intuition about the extreme moral questions. To say more would be presuming what the data would be without actually testing it. We land, then, at least on the side of unconvinced but perhaps hopeful for the moral argument. Human purpose \"You and your beliefs are the product of a long chain of inevitable physical events. [...] It's all just a series of physical events - billiard balls bouncing off one another. They aren't the least bit interested in the truth or falsity of the thoughts they are producing. Understanding the self-defeating nature of the naturalist worldview was a penny-dropping moment for me. It meant that seeking meaning of any sort was a self-defeating enterprise for a thoroughgoing atheist. Just as the collisions of the balls on the billiard-table only mean anything if there is a player who intended them to find a pocket, so we must be more than the matter that makes up our brain. Here again, I think Brierley is failing from a lack of imagination. Meaning is a structure we attribute to actions and events in our lives. It seems to follow naturally from our pattern-seeking tendencies combined with our goals to increase well-being. I find nothing too problematic with this view, even if we don't currently understand the detailed nature of consciousness. There is a downside to notice for the \"meaning from God\" perspective, and that is the fact that the notion of eternal life in heaven makes this life not have any meaning, due to its finiteness. Even if this life is supposedly a test for admission, the fact that the current life is finite compared to the infinite afterlife is enough to rob it of any significant meaning. Clearly there are arguments on each side for this, but I just wanted to point out that it isn't completely clear even on the theistic perspective. Historical arguments Brierley nicely summarizes the historical arguments, both in the establishment of the existence of Jesus and the arguments of the Resurrection. My largest concern with these arguments is the amount of trust that is placed in historical methods. When confronted with the idea that we can't know the details of historical events to the level of repeatable, physical experiments, most people don't seem to take issue. However, the claim that someone rose from the dead is something that - in a modern context - we'd want medical records, corroborating physical evidence, and we'd still be pretty skeptical that someone was putting us on. Placing these events two thousand years ago, written decades after the events, by largely anonymous sources should make us less confident in the claim, not more. The minimal facts approach to the historicity of the Resurrection seems to be a major selling point for Christian apologists. Although not a historian myself, I have read enough to see that this approach seems to never be used for any other historical event - why the special case? I have personally found that the response by Matthew Ferguson - who is a historian - is as complete a response that one will ever find, and haven't seen anything even remotely convincing as a reply. The Atheist's Greatest Objection - Suffering I'll start my response here to point out that the argument from suffering is not the atheist's greatest objection. Like Matt Dillahunty , in my opinion the greatest objection to the theistic claim of the existence of God is from hiddenness . True to Brierley's form, he grapples well with all sides of the issue of suffering, bringing in all of the typical theistic counter arguments - but they are all indirect. He implores us to appreciate how the preponderance of the other arguments for God \"tips the scale towards belief in God.\" He puts forward the idea that the objection is baseless because of the lack of objective morality under the atheist worldview. \"it's difficult to see how the reality of a world of moral right and wrong can exist in the absence of God. But the question being asked by the atheist is a fundamentally moral one.\" He appeals to mystery, \"it is a mystery we believe will be answered in a day of final justice and joy when Jesus Christ sets the world to right.\" and free will, hidden purpose of suffering, and an allegory. Books have been written on this problem, and this chapter summarizes the topic nicely. I am not moved by it because it feels to me - like all treatments of this topic - one excuse after another with nothing to pin it down. As Sam Harris says, one can always answer the question \"is suffering and evil consistent with God?\" with a \"yes\" - the better question to ask is, \"does the suffering we observe in the world suggest there is an all-knowing, benevolent God?\" To that, the answer is clearly \"no\". Sure! You can always come up with reasons for the former, but the later is much clearer. Hiddenness The really big objection, in my view, is hiddenness - the lack of obvious indicators of a divine presence. If God actually wants a relationship with people then God's lack of obvious existence is completely inconsistent with that, in a way that appealing to free will, the purpose of relationship, allegory and mystery just don't work. If you look at nearly every one of my responses, it really comes down to not being convinced due to the lack of unambiguous evidence. Conclusions I could go on with this review, but it is long enough as it is. I applaud Brierley's efforts in summarizing 10 years of conversations on this topic. I totally endorse his goal of improving conversation on difficult topics; and his tone in this book and the podcast should be a model for everyone. Perhaps Brierley's book is just one more data point of confirmation bias, and perhaps my review is also. How do we get past that? The best way is to have the conversations, honestly and completely, and to constantly question your own perspective. I want to thank Brierley for his fine work and hope he continues these efforts far into the future.","tags":"religion","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2019/Feb/11/book-review-unbelievable-by-justin-brierley/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2019/Feb/11/book-review-unbelievable-by-justin-brierley/"},{"title":"If at first you don't succeed (for 50 times) you might reconsider","text":"Here's a straightforward problem from Quora - probably found in a textbook - but I try to find a new direction to make it more interesting. If there is a 25% chance of something, what is the probability that you fail to succeed 50 times in a row before you finally do succeed? The problem, as stated, gives you a very small probability of 50 failures followed by a success. As stated, this probability is simply \\(P(S_{51}, F_{1,2,\\cdots,50}) = 0.75&#94;{50} \\times 0.25 \\sim 10&#94;{-7}\\) However, we rarely know that an event has exactly a probability of 25% - this is usually just a hunch. Or possibly we believe the probability to be 25% but in fact it's actually 0% or in other words (unknowingly) impossible - the claim itself can be wrong. Further, the way the question is worded almost implies that you're trying to decide to abandon...or not...an action after 50 failures. This is a different question than the original, I admit, but much closer to what one might expect in a more realistic scenario. Pursuing this adjusted question, say we have the following two possibilities: the original claim that \\(p_{\\rm event}=0.25\\) or the claim is false and (for example) \\(p_{\\rm event}=0\\) . Let's further assume that we are quite sure of the original claim, at level of 99.99%. With the new question, we are interested in the probability of a success on try 51 after 50 previous failures, which is now a combination of the result of the claim possibly being true and the claim possibly being false. I will outline the process for \\(m\\) failures instead of 50, so that we can discuss it in a more interesting way. \\(P(S_{51}| F_{1,2,\\cdots,50}) = P(S_{51}| F_{1,2,\\cdots,m}, {\\rm True\\ Claim})P({\\rm True\\ Claim}|F_{1,2,\\cdots,m}) + P(S_{51}| F_{1,2,\\cdots,m}, {\\rm False\\ Claim})P({\\rm False\\ Claim}|F_{1,2,\\cdots,m})\\) The key part of this calculation is the comparison of the two possibilities (i.e. the claim is true or the claim is false) after observing 50 failures. We can apply Bayes Rule, \\(P({\\rm True\\ Claim}|F_{1,2,\\cdots,m}) \\sim P(F_{1,2,\\cdots,m}| {\\rm True\\ Claim})\\cdot P({\\rm True\\ Claim}) \\sim 0.75&#94;m \\cdot 0.9999\\) \\(P({\\rm False\\ Claim}|F_{1,2,\\cdots,m}) \\sim P(F_{1,2,\\cdots,m}| {\\rm False\\ Claim})\\cdot P({\\rm False\\ Claim})\\sim 1 \\cdot 0.0001\\) After only 32 failures these two probabilities are equal, or in other words, it's even money that the action is even possible . After 50 failures, the odds for the original claim are around 180:1 against. Clearly we are facing the definition of insanity 1 at this point. Essentially, because 50 failures is so unlikely for a 25% chance event or action, other possibilities intrude - such as \"success at all is impossible\". There can, of course, be other possibilities that come to mind after many failures beyond the one I explore here. However, the point that I want to stress is that one should think a little more deeply when faced even with such \"simple\" problems. doing the same thing over and over expecting a different result. ↩","tags":"math","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2019/Jan/29/if-at-first-you-dont-succeed-for-50-times-you-might-reconsider/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2019/Jan/29/if-at-first-you-dont-succeed-for-50-times-you-might-reconsider/"},{"title":"Dynamical systems with pyndamics","text":"Describe dynamical systems in terms of the differential equations without having to write the coding loops or functions.

Without a theoretical structure to connect diverse observations with one another, the result would be a listing of facts of little use in understanding what the brain is about.In the work that follows, we present the Bienenstock, Cooper and Munro (BCM) theory of synaptic plasticity. The theory is sufficiently concrete so that it can be and, as is discussed below, has been compared with experiment. Natural Images This is a collection of natural images used in my research.

Effect of correlated lateral geniculate nucleus firing rates on predictions for monocular eye closure versus monocular retinal inactivation Physical Review E 80 (6): 061915. Monocular deprivation experiments can be used to distinguish between different ideas concerning properties of cortical synaptic plasticity. Monocular deprivation by lid suture causes a rapid disconnection of the deprived eye connected to cortical neurons whereas total inactivation of the deprived eye produces much less of an ocular dominance shift. In order to understand these results one needs to know how lid suture and retinal inactivation affect neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) that provide the cortical input. Recent experimental results by Linden et al. showed that monocular lid suture and monocular inactivation do not change the mean firing rates of LGN neurons but that lid suture reduces correlations between adjacent neurons whereas monocular inactivation leads to correlated firing. These, somewhat surprising, results contradict assumptions that have been made to explain the outcomes of different monocular deprivation protocols. Based on these experimental results we modify our assumptions about inputs to cortex during different deprivation protocols and show their implications when combined with different cortical plasticity rules. Using theoretical analysis, random matrix theory and simulations we show that high levels of correlations reduce the ocular dominance shift in learning rules that depend on homosynaptic depression (i.e., Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro type rules), consistent with experimental results, but have the opposite effect in rules that depend on heterosynaptic depression (i.e., Hebbian/principal component analysis type rules).

F. 2008 Recovery from monocular deprivation using binocular deprivation: Experimental observations and theoretical analysis . Journal of Neurophysiology 100:2217-2224. Ocular dominance (OD) plasticity is a robust paradigm for examining the functional consequences of synaptic plasticity. Previous experimental and theoretical results have shown that OD plasticity can be accounted for by known synaptic plasticity mechanisms, using the assumption that deprivation by lid suture eliminates spatial structure in the deprived channel. Here we show that in the mouse, recovery from monocular lid suture can be obtained by subsequent binocular lid suture but not by dark rearing. This poses a significant challenge to previous theoretical results. We therefore performed simulations with a natural input environment appropriate for mouse visual cortex. In contrast to previous work we assume that lid suture causes degradation but not elimination of spatial structure, whereas dark rearing produces elimination of spatial structure. We present experimental evidence that supports this assumption, measuring responses through sutured lids in the mouse. The change in assumptions about the input environment is sufficient to account for new experimental observations, while still accounting for previous experimental results. Blais, B.S. and Cooper, L.N 2008. BCM Theory . Scholarpedia 3(3):1570. BCM (Bienenstock et al., 1982) refers to the theory of synaptic modification first proposed by Elie Bienenstock, Leon Cooper, and Paul Munro in 1982 to account for experiments measuring the selectivity of neurons in primary sensory [8]cortex and its dependency on neuronal input. It is characterized by a rule expressing synaptic change as a Hebb-like product of the presynaptic activity and a nonlinear function, \\phi(y;\\theta_M) , of postsynatic activity, y. For low values of the postsynaptic activity ( y<\\theta_M ), \\phi is negative; for y>\\theta_M , \\phi is positive. The rule is stabilized by allowing the modification threshold, \\theta_M , to vary as a super-linear function of the previous activity of the cell. Unlike traditional methods of stabilizing Hebbian learning, this \"sliding threshold\" provides a mechanism for incoming patterns, as opposed to converging afferents, to compete. A detailed exploration can be found in the book Theory of Cortical Plasticity (Cooper et al., 2004). For an open-source implementation of the BCM, amongst other synaptic modification rules, see the Plasticity package [1] . Shouval, H.Z, Gavornik, J. P., Shuler, M., Bear, M. F., and Blais, B.S. 2007. Learning Reward Timing using Reinforced Expression of Synaptic Plasticity In Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience (CRCNS) Conference . Our collaborative research proposes to study the synaptic and cellular basis of receptive field plasticity in visual cortex. Recently some of our efforts have concentrated on accounting for novel aspects of cellular responses and plasticity observed in the visual cortex of the rat. In recently published findings we provided evidence that pairing visual cues with subsequent rewards in awake behaving animals results in the emergence, in the primary visual cortex (V1), of reward-timing activity (Shuler and Bear, 2006). Further, the properties of reward-timing activity suggest that it is generated locally within V1, implying that V1 is privy to a signal relating the acquisition of reward. We provide here a model demonstrating how such interval timing of reward could emerge in V1. A fundamental assumption of this work is that the timing characteristics of the V1 network are encoded in the lateral connectivity within the network, consequently the plasticity assumed in this model is of these recurrent connections. Using this assumption, no prior stimulus-locked temporal representation is necessary. The plasticity of recurrent connections is implemented through an interaction between an activity dependent Hebbian like plasticity, and a neuromodulatory signal signifying reward. It is demonstrated that such a global reinforcement signal is sufficient for interval time learning by stabilizing changes in nascent synaptic efficacy resultant from prior visually-evoked activity. By modifying synaptic weight change within the recurrent network of V1, our model transforms temporally restricted visual events into neurally persistent activity relating to their associated reward timing expectancy. Shouval, H.Z, Bear, M.F., and Blais, B.S. 2006. The cellular basis of receptive field plasticity in visual cortex, an integrative experimental and theoretical approach . In Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience (CRCNS) Conference . Synaptic plasticity is a likely basis for information storage by the neocortex. Understanding cortical plasticity requires coordinated investigation of both underlying cellular mechanisms and their systems-level consequences in the same model system. However, establishing connections between the cellular and system levels of description is non-trivial. A major contribution of theoretical neuroscience is that it can link different levels of description, and in doing so can direct experiments to the questions of greatest relevance. The objective of the current project is to generate a theoretical description of experience-dependent plasticity in the rodent visual system. The advantages of rodents are, first, that knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity is relatively mature and continues to be advanced with genetic and pharmacological experiments, and second, rodents show robust receptive field plasticity in visual cortex (VC) that can be easily and inexpensively monitored with chronic recording methods. The project aims are threefold. First, the activity of inputs to rat visual cortex will be recorded in different viewing conditions that induce receptive field (RF) plasticity, and these data will be integrated into formal models of synaptic plasticity. Second, the dynamics of RF plasticity will be simulated using existing spike rate-based algorithms and compared will experimental observations. Third, the consequences of new biophysically plausible plasticity algorithms, based on spike timing and metaplasticity, will be analyzed and compared with experiments.6 Blais, B.S. and Kuindersma, S. 2005. Synaptic Modification in Spiking-Rate Models: A Comparison between Learning in Spiking Neurons and Rate-Based Neuron Models In Society For Neuroscience Conference Abstracts Rate-based neuron models have been successful in understanding many aspects of development such as the development of orientation selectivity(Bienenstock et al., 1982; Oja, 1982; Linsker, 1986; Miller, 1992; Bell and Sejnowski, 1997), the particular dynamics of visual deprivation(Blais et al., 1999) and the development of direction selectivity(Wimbauer et al., 1997; Blais et al., 2000). These models do not address phenomena such as temporal coding, spike-timing dependant synaptic plasticity, or any short-time behavior of neurons. More detailed spiking models (Song et.al, 2000; Shouval et.al. 2002; Yeung et.al. 2004) address these issues, and have had some success, but have failed to develop receptive fields in natural environments. These more detailed models are diffiult to explore, given their large number of parameters and the run-time computational limitations. In addition, their results are often diffiult to compare directly with the rate-based models. We propose a model, which we call a spiking-rate model, which can serve as a middle-ground between the over simplistic rate-based models, and the more detailed spiking models. The spiking-rate model is a spiking model where all of the underlying processes are continuous Poisson, the summation of inputs is entirely linear (although non-linearities can be added), and the generation of outputs is done by calculating a rate output and then generating an appropriate Poisson spike train. In this way, the limiting behavior is identical to a rate-based model, but the proper ties of spiking models can be incorporated more easily. We present the development of receptive i!elds with this model in various visual environments. We then present the necessary conditions for the receptive field development in the spiking-rate models, and make comparisons to detailed spiking models, in order to more clearly understand the necessary conditions for receptive field development Yeung, L.C., Shouval, H.Z, Blais, B.S., Cooper, L. N. 2004. Synaptic Homeostasis and Input Selectivity Follow From a Calcium-Dependent Plasticity Model . Proceedings of the National Academy of Science . Vol 101, Issue 41. 14943-14948. Modifications in the strengths of synapses are thought to underlie memory, learning, and development of cortical circuits. Many cellular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity have been investigated in which differential elevations of postsynaptic calcium concentrations play a key role in determining the direction and magnitude of synaptic changes. We have previously described a model of plasticity that uses calcium currents mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors as the associative signal for Hebbian learning. However, this model is not completely stable. Here, we propose a mechanism of stabilization through homeostatic regulation of intracellular calcium levels. With this model, synapses are stable and exhibit properties such as those observed in metaplasticity and synaptic scaling. In addition, the model displays synaptic competition, allowing structures to emerge in the synaptic space that reflect the statistical properties of the inputs. Therefore, the combination of a fast calcium-dependent learning and a slow stabilization mechanism can account for both the formation of selective receptive fields and the maintenance of neural circuits in a state of equilibrium.

This invaluable book presents a theory of cortical plasticity and shows how this theory leads to experiments that test both its assumptions and consequences. It ellucidates, in a manner that is accessible to students as well as researchers, the role which the BCM theory has played in guiding research and suggesting experiments that have led to our present understanding of the mechanisms underlying cortical plasticity. Most of the connections betwen theory and experiment that are discussed require complex simulations. A unique feature of the book is the accompanying software package, Plasticity . This is provided complete with source code, and enables the reader to repeat any of the simulations quoted in the book as well as to vary either parameters or assumptions. Plasticity is thus a research and an educational tool. Readers can use it to obtain hands-on knowledge of the structure of BCM and various other learning algorithms. They can check and replicate our results as well as test algorithms and refinements of their own.","tags":"books","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2019/Jan/14/models-of-learning-and-memory/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2019/Jan/14/models-of-learning-and-memory/"},{"title":"Stats for Everyone","text":"Have a statistics question or project?

In this paper, we explore a variety of models attempting to explain the pollution-income relationship (PIR). There has been much literature addressing the notion of an environmental Kuznets curve (EKC). Many researchers find an EKC relationship for certain pollutants, while others do not find evidence of an EKC relationship. There is also literature formally critiquing the EKC. We employ cross-sectional, panel, and time-series analysis to add insight into the relationship between economic growth and environmental degradation, a research area that is far from consensual and that has practical implications. We ultimately find that the clearest case of an EKC effect in our study arises in the analysis of organic water pollution, while there is modest evidence suggesting an EKC effect with regard to CO2, NO, and methane. We also present ample evidence suggesting an anti-EKC effect for PM10. Our analysis causes us to question the existence of an EKC effect throughout the environment in general.

His tor. Bot. 19 (1-2) pp 75-88. We measured I'C and I'15N values and carbon and nitrogen elemental concentrations of leaves collected from Metasequoia glyptostroboides Hu et Cheng trees cultivated at 39 sites across the United States under different latitudes and climatic regions. I'D values from south facing leaf n-alkanes of 27 trees were also determined. Climate data over the past 50 years (1950a2009) were compiled from stations near each site. Isotope data were cross plotted against each geographic and climatic parameter, including latitude, annual mean temperature (AMT), spring (FebruaryaMay) mean temperature (SMT), annual mean precipitation (AMP), and spring mean precipitation (SMP). Statistical analyses revealed the following signicant correlations: 1) a strong negative correlation between n-alkane D and latitude; 2) statistically signicant correlations between D and both AMT and SMT; 3) a weaker but still signicant correlation between I'D and SMP; 4) statistically signicant relationships between carbon concentration and both temperature and precipitation parameters, especially AMP; 5) an unexpected correlation between nitrogen concentration and SMP. These results bear strong implications for using I'13C and I'D values obtained from fossil Metasequoia as paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental proxies. Kuindersma, S.R. and Blais, B.S. 2007. Teaching Bayesian Model Comparison With the Three-sided Coin . American Statistician . Vol. 61, No. 3, August 2007 pp.239-244 In the present work we introduce the problem of determining the probability that a rotating and bouncing cylinder (i.e. flipped coin) will land and come to rest on its edge. We present this problem and analysis as a practical, nontrivial example to introduce the reader to Bayesian model comparison. Several models are presented, each of which take into consideration different physical aspects of the problem and the relative effects on the edge landing probability. The Bayesian formulation of model comparison is then used to compare the models and their predictive agreement with data from hand-flipped cylinders of several sizes.","tags":"books","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2019/Jan/14/stats-for-everyone/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2019/Jan/14/stats-for-everyone/"},{"title":"Bryant Faculty Spotlight","text":"This video is part of the Bryant Faculty Spotlight series.

They are: Everything is essentially mechanical. Dogs, for example, are complex mechanisms, rather than living organisms with goals of their own. Even people are machines, ‘lumbering robots', in Richard Dawkins's vivid phrase, with brains that are like genetically programmed computers. All matter is unconscious. It has no inner life or subjectivity or point of view. Even human consciousness is an illusion produced by the material activities of brains. The total amount of matter and energy is always the same (with the exception of the Big Bang, when all the matter and energy of the universe suddenly appeared). The laws of nature are fixed. They are the same today as they were at the beginning, and they will stay the same for ever. Nature is purposeless, and evolution has no goal or direction. All biological inheritance is material, carried in the genetic material, DNA, and in other material structures. Minds are inside heads and are nothing but the activities of brains. When you look at a tree, the image of the tree you are seeing is not ‘out there', where it seems to be, but inside your brain. Memories are stored as material traces in brains and are wiped out at death. Unexplained phenomena like telepathy are illusory. Mechanistic medicine is the only kind that really works. These are presented as dogmas, unquestioned by scientists and taken for granted. Many of these are demonstrably false or misleading. When he states (1) that animals and people \"are complex mechanisms, rather than living organisms with goals of their own\", this is an either-or fallacy. They could be both mechanisms and agents. It could be that we use different vocabulary on different scales - I don't describe baseball in terms of quantum mechanics, even though I am confident that all the components of baseball is governed by quantum mechanics. Sheldrake lists a number of things which are poorly understood, for which there is a growing list of research, the conclusions of which are not taken dogmatically. Similarly, there are a number of things in the list where research has been done, and the current perspective (not dogma!) has been arrived at because there has been no evidence to support the alternatives that Sheldrake is implying. Examples of these include (2) \"All matter is unconscious\", (8) \"Memories are stored as material traces\", (5) \"evolution has no goal\", (7) \"Minds are inside heads\". With (3), although energy is conserved (in a closed system) and matter is a subset of energy, it is not believed that the Big Bang produced energy. Rather, if the universe came from nothing then the total energy of the universe must be zero - which it empirically seems to be. If the universe did not come from nothing, but came out of a universe-producing process then the energy didn't \"suddenly appear\" as Sheldrake suggests. As to (4), the so-called fixed laws of Nature are a theory - which explains and is consistent with a huge variety of observations. Thus, we are confident in this particular theory. It is possible, though, that the laws to change - and that would be measurable. It is not taken as a dogma. Point (9) \"Unexplained phenomena like telepathy are illusory\" is misleading, given its incompleteness. It seems that, given years of observation, telepathy is in fact illusory. However, there are many unexplained phenomena that are not illusory, e.g. dark matter, the placebo effect, etc... In every one of these cases, scientists don't hold these as dogmas . If you have evidence, then present it! If it turns out that you can demonstrate telepathy, that would be fantastic - but everyone who has tried so far has not been able to demonstrate it. It may be that the universe has purpose, and perhaps it is possible to differentiate a process with a purpose from one without in certain circumstances, but the person making the claim of the extra \"purpose\" must be the one to bear the burden of proof. I think it is easier for Sheldrake to accuse someone of a dogmatic view rather than do the hard work of actually convincing them with evidence. Just because I disagree with you doesn't mean that I am dogmatically holding to my view - you just haven't done your homework.","tags":"science","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2018/Jun/18/10-dogmas-of-science-dismantled/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2018/Jun/18/10-dogmas-of-science-dismantled/"},{"title":"There is more than enough time","text":"Here are some notes about time management that I found useful from this article : If you're with your friends, be with your friends.

Harris brought this up at the end of a long podcast with Peterson , but didn't press Peterson on it. Make sure to compare it to a transcript of Jordan Peterson's interpretation of Cain and Abel , which is representative of many of the things Peterson speaks about: https://memoirsofanamnesic.wordpress.com/2010/07/01/interpreting-cain-and-abel-pt-i/ Once you read Harris' Cookbook exposition, you never see Peterson the same again. Peterson claims that he only believes those interpretations that can be tied to four difference levels of understanding simultaneously, but I think that ends up being a smokescreen and that the same linguistic gymnastics can be done even in this case. From Sam Harris, The End of Faith : The problem with such hermeneutical efforts [...] is that they are perfectly unconstrained by the contents of the texts themselves. One can interpret every text in such a way as to yield almost any mystical or occult instruction. A case in point: I have selected another book at random, this time from the cookbook aisle of a bookstore. The book is A Taste of Hawaii: New Cooking from the Crossroads of the Pacific . Therein I have discovered an as yet uncelebrated mystical treatise. While it appears to be a recipe for wok-seared fish and shrimp cakes with ogo-tomato relish, we need only study its list of ingredients to know that we are in the presence of an unrivaled spiritual intelligence: snapper filet, cubed 3 teaspoons chopped scallions salt and freshly ground black pepper a dash of cayenne pepper 2 teaspoons chopped fresh ginger 1 teaspoon minced garlic 8 shrimp, peeled, deveined, and cubed 1⁄2 cup heavy cream; 2 eggs, lightly beaten 3 teaspoons rice wine; 2 cups bread crumbs 3 tablespoons vegetable oil; 2 1⁄2 cups ogo-tomato relish The snapper filet , of course, is the individual himself —you and I— awash in the sea of existence. But here we find it cubed, which is to say that our situation must be remedied in all three dimensions of body, mind, and spirit. Three teaspoons of chopped scallions further partakes of the cubic symmetry, suggesting that that which we need add to each level of our being by way of antidote comes likewise in equal proportions. The import of the passage is clear: the body, mind, and spirit need to be tended to with the same care. Salt and freshly ground black pepper : here we have the perennial invocation of opposites—the white and the black aspects of our nature. Both good and evil must be understood if we would fulfill the recipe for spiritual life. Nothing, after all, can be excluded from the human experience (this seems to be a Tantric text). What is more, salt and pepper come to us in the form of grains, which is to say that our good and bad qualities are born of the tiniest actions. Thus, we are not good or evil in general, but only by virtue of innumerable moments, which color the stream of our being by force of repetition. A dash of cayenne pepper : clearly, being of such robust color and flavor, this signifies the spiritual influence of an enlightened adept. What shall we make of the ambiguity of its measurement? How large is a dash? Here we must rely upon the wisdom of the universe at large. The teacher himself will know precisely what we need by way of instruction. And it is at just this point in the text that the ingredients that bespeak the heat of spiritual endeavor are added to the list—for after a dash of cayenne pepper, we find two teaspoons of chopped fresh ginger and one teaspoon of minced garlic. These form an isosceles trinity of sorts, signifying the two sides of our spiritual nature (male and female) united with the object meditation. Next comes eight shrimp—peeled, deveined, and cubed . The eight shrimp, of course, represent the eight worldly concerns that every spiritual aspirant must decry: fame and shame; loss and gain; pleasure and pain; praise and blame. Each needs to be deveined, peeled, and cubed— that is, purged of its power to entrance us and incorporated on the path of practice. That such metaphorical acrobatics can be performed on almost any text—and that they are therefore meaningless—should be obvious.","tags":"religion","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2018/May/22/a-cookbook-response-to-jordan-peterson/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2018/May/22/a-cookbook-response-to-jordan-peterson/"},{"title":"Exploring the Idea of Scrum","text":"Although I am not in software development, and I don't work in a lot of teams, I have recently read the book Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time ( https://www.scruminc.com/new-scrum-the-book/ ) which I find very interesting and possibly quite useful 1 . As far as I can tell, the Scrum process derives its value from a few key concepts, which can equally well apply to individuals as well as teams, to academia as well as software development. These key concepts, as I see them is, Work is done in a short, cyclical pattern: 1-2 week \"sprints\" The work - the goals, on deck (aka backlog), work in progress, and done - is displayed publicly (or at least prominently to the team) at all times . This is typically done with a physical scrum board , but can also be done in software. A demonstration occurs at the end a work \"sprint\". The result of the sprint is something deliverable and complete , even if small, and this is demonstrate to the people to whom the work has value. A review of the process and results occurs regularly at the end of each sprint If working on a team, we add the further concept A team needs to have absolutely everyone who is needed to complete the work. This will often involve people at many levels of a hierarchy. As an addition, there are a few other things I learned from the book. The role of management is to remove the impediments to getting projects done. So, part of the review process is to list the impediments to the work so that management can work on that. Short (15-minute) \"scrum\" meetings answering \"what have I done since the last, what are my impediments, what am I going to get done\" Focussing on value rather than work is more productive. The \"deliver quickly\" and adapt is a better strategy than trying to deliver a large, complete, and possibly incorrect product. Meanwhile I am also working my way through the book Agile Faculty: Practical Strategies for Managing Research, Service and Teaching. ( http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/A/bo26106581.html ) I'm interested if any of these ideas will help in my own practices, and whether I can gain some benefit for the department and university processes with these ideas.

Two questions were raised as evidence for God that I think are telling: how do you get life from non-life? how do you get the personal from the impersonal? The answers to these questions points to the properties of God, as traditionally understood. My first reaction is, even if we didn't know the answers to these questions we would still not be in a position to make a positive claim for the explanation (e.g. God) without making the further step of obtaining evidence for the positive claim. This is a God-of-the-Gaps move. Secondly, although neither question is understood in sufficient detail, we have made substantial progress in understanding the origin of life and the origin of consciousness . Far more progress than is made by assuming an agent simply created it. We should avoid jumping to a positive claim without the evidence for that claim, and note our tendency to do just that in the face of mystery.","tags":"religion","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2018/Mar/06/life-from-non-life-and-other-conundrums/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2018/Mar/06/life-from-non-life-and-other-conundrums/"},{"title":"Top Reasons for Belief","text":"In the Unbelievable podcast episode 27 Oct 2007 - Top reasons for belief there is a discussion around the results of a small survey of reasons for belief in God and belief in Christianity specifically. They discussed the tension between analytical justifications and those based on revelation or personal experience. It was interesting that they never addressed the fact that personal experience is an unreliable way of determining the truth of a proposition. When they did discuss reasons, the usual suspects came up - arguments from first cause, morality, and design. I was however struck by the conviction that these arguments were basically unassailable. For example, one Reverend summarized the first cause argument. \"Everything that begins to exist has a cause\" - which he added \"was a matter of logic and can be proved and thus is uncontroversial.\" He followed with \"the universe began to exist.\" to which he added \"of course that's true because the universe is here.\" He then expressed his admiration that this argument was written hundreds of years ago. What I find interesting is not that someone would believe this argument, but that they would so uncritically accept it - the universe existing does not necessarily imply that it began to exist. Just because your common sense suggests that everything that begins to exist has a cause doesn't mean that your common sense should hold for things outside of your own personal scale - things may be quite different and unintuitive on the scale of the very big or very small. The discussion did mention the practical benefit of Christian belief, in the specific case of forgiveness taking away bitterness. This may in fact be true, but can't one achieve this without believing all of the other parts? I think so, but sometimes I wonder whether people need a form of narrative to structure their most fundamental beliefs - a human limitation perhaps - and that this narrative could be a requirement to get the levels of positive behaviors we'd like out of humanity.","tags":"Unbelievable Project","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2018/Mar/05/top-reasons-for-belief/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2018/Mar/05/top-reasons-for-belief/"},{"title":"Physics Lab Ideas - Structure or No?","text":"Over the years I have taught introductory physics labs and I have seen that most \"canned\" labs offer very little to the student in the form of learning.

How do you improve these sorts of labs? I have a few ideas. choose problems where the answer isn't known or known well push the limit of a particular simple case into the area where the simple case breaks down have the students design the lab themselves to answer a question So, for the case of the acceleration due to gravity, put it as a model comparison problem: Model 1 = objects fall with a constant speed Model 2 = objects fall with a constant acceleration Then you give objects to the students such as pennies, packing peanuts, coffee filters, marbles, etc… Some objects might be best explained with Model 2 while others with Model 1. Neither model may describe some perfectly. How can you tell? Having the students design the resulting tests makes the laboratory experience a lot more interesting.

In another article , Justin Brierley comments on some of his observations as the moderator of atheist-theist debates. Some of his observations, unfortunately, are wrong. For example, \"Almost every atheist I meet wears the spectacles of 'naturalism'. It's the view that there is no supernatural dimension to existence. All that really exists is physical matter in motion.\" This sounds suspiciously like \"philosophical naturalism\", to which I know of no one who ascribes. There is \"methodological naturalism\" which simply states that we may assume, for the moment as a practical matter, that there isn't a supernatural realm. We'll continue to assume that until someone can demonstrate the supernatural. This isn't as much wearing \"spectacles of ‘naturalism'\" but the only pragmatic choice an honest inquiry can support. Another way to look at it is to notice that science evaluates well-defined claims . We know of no method which can handle non-well-defined claims and we have yet to see a definition of supernatural that is well defined. Is there one? Until someone puts forward something useful, we can proceed without including it in our descriptions. \"Consequently, there is no realm of right or wrong to be discovered in life, no overarching purpose to things, no ultimate meaning to reach for in the universe.\" Which is also possibly wrong, and I dealt with it in the previous post . Even if you're not convinced of this argument, you have to admit there is - for some people - a reasonable argument for morality under naturalism. \"When BBC broadcaster and atheist scientist Jim Al-Khalili came on my Unbelievable? show he acknowledged: 'It's a huge philosophical question: why does nature speak the language of mathematics?'. Nobel Prize winning physicist Eugene Wigner termed it 'the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics', describing it as a 'wonderful gift we neither understand nor deserve'.\" \"Are we to simply say 'pass' on this question?\" Perhaps this is a necessary fact? Perhaps there is an explanation, but we don't have access to it? God, however, is no explanation. As Robert Price notes, you're trying to explain unknown X with unknown double-X! \"Our belief in the intrinsic dignity and worth of human beings is best explained by Christianity. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights tapped into a foundational view of humanity established by our Judeo-Christian heritage, one which we jettison at our peril. Our belief in the intrinsic value of humanity can't be explained by atheism. But if we are made in the image of God, as Christianity claims, then that gives every human being inestimable value.\" Except, the Bible itself clearly delineates superior and inferior people! It specifies, in great detail, how one should treat slavery depending on whether they are the chosen people or not. Furthermore, Jesus - despite some of his better messages - never speaks against that and tacitly endorses it with the \"not one jot of the law will be abolished\" statement. All-in-all I find Justin's claims here, despite his good intentions, to be a testament to confirmation bias - which perhaps I am suffering from as well?

These reasons aren't particularly compelling to me. They are the following. God Makes Sense Of Human Existence Here, Justin cites the Fine Tuning Argument, which has its best take-down in the Sean-Carroll/William Lane Craig debate . It's really an argument from physics, and the physics isn't at all clear on whether the effect is there, or whether the interpretation of the effect is even reasonable. God Makes Sense Of Human Value Here, Justin states: But why exactly do we believe that human life should be valued? Why did Jaime do the right thing – the human thing? I find it very hard to come up with an answer on an atheistic world view. Why should humans have any more claim for special regard on the biological tree of life than a louse? There's nothing intrinsically special about us in a universe that is blindly obeying the laws of nature. Any beliefs in objective human rights, values and morality are ultimately an illusion, a side-effect of our evolutionary history. Here I think Sam Harris has the best word for this but Matt Dillahunty also does quite well with it. God Makes Sense Of Human Purpose Finally, Justin states, Atheism and Christianity tell two very different stories – one is of ultimate purposelessness and the other is of ultimate hope. Hope that there is a reason for our existence, hope that our lives mean something, the hope that death is not the end. Is it a delusion? The word \"purpose\" I think is a little less defined than I'd like, but it seems that if heaven exists then there really is no purpose for this life. I am also not convinced that purpose requires an infinite time - that if you exist for a finite time then you can have purpose. It may also be the case that there is no purpose - but how we feel about that should have no effect on the truth.","tags":"religion","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2018/Feb/06/3-reasons-why-belief-in-god-makes-sense/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2018/Feb/06/3-reasons-why-belief-in-god-makes-sense/"},{"title":"Facts are Not Enough","text":"In the October issue of Significance magazine, an article called \"Why facts are not enough in the fight against fake news\" by Brian Tarran resonated with some of the things I have been thinking.

This appeal to emotion is a central component of the post-truth phenomenon.\" \"Post-truth is a very specific and very twenty-first century problem, which is where emotion trumps factual assessment and evidence.\" \"…bombarding people with facts is not enough, and that the answer to fake news is to wrap our response to it in an emotionalism that does not compromise factual accuracy, but acknowledges that the way in which people respond to information has changed.\" \"\"…we have to always have a mixture of telling people's human stories while at the same time giving context to those stories and giving the real facts.\" Reading this, I am immediately reminded of a few things. The book Don't Be Such a Scientist: Talking Substance in an Age of Style by Randy Olson, which outlines the importance of using stories to communicate science, and that we lose the public when we don't. The TV series Cosmos, with Carl Sagan, where he did just that - used stories and visualization to convey the emotional impact of science. Interviews with Scott Adams, a professed Trump supporter, who refers to Trump as the \"Master Persuader\". Don't believe me? Listen to his interview on the Art of Charm podcast . His point as I read it is that Trump is very good at providing visually and emotionally engaging points, despite the facts, to build solidarity in the base and to disarm his opponents. This is the epitome of the post-truth culture.","tags":"critical thinking","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2018/Feb/05/facts-are-not-enough/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2018/Feb/05/facts-are-not-enough/"},{"title":"More than Enough Time","text":"Here are some notes about time management that I found useful from this article : If you're with your friends, be with your friends.

There is also a history of introducing entities into models which later turn out to be unnecessary - \"Vis viva\" (i.e. life force), \"phlogiston\" (i.e. heat fluid), and \"celestial matter\" (vs terrestial matter). It is not that scientists are dogmatically against such entities, it's just that they should be dropped when they don't explain and predict anything or alternative explanations are simpler and more direct. We don't use agency to explain the motion of the planets anymore, for example, but we once did. There are other entities in models which serve as placeholders for the unknown, for example \"dark matter\". No one seriously thinks labeling the gravitational effect observed from galactic rotation curves is better understood once we label it \"dark matter\". It is just a placeholder, until we figure out what dark matter actually is - neutrinos, black holes, altered gravitation on large scale, etc...

It's only tenet is an entirely reactionary one - no theology\", and \"Naturalism is unable to ground its own intelligibility which means it collapses into nihilism\" abound. Philosopher Alvin Plantinga has an Evolutionary argument against naturalism . The way I see it is the following. There used to be a distinction between \"terrestrial\" and \"celestial\" matter. Then it was determined that the planets obeyed the same rules as the apples falling from trees and the need for the distinction disappeared. \"Celestial\" matter disappeared as did \"terrestrial\" matter leaving just \"matter\". Since then, we have determined, that pretty much everything we can observe follows the same rules - although some get blurred at different scales (microscopic vs macroscopic, for example). Naturalism then is simply the recognition that the stuff we see day-to-day operates on the same principles as the stars in the early universe, and the galaxies far far away. So if you can show us something that is observable yet doesn't follow these rules - something which follows a separate set of rules - then perhaps it might be time to introduce the distinction between natural and supernatural. Otherwise, there is no need for the added concept of the supernatural. Is there such an observable? What are its rules? As a side-note, this means that naturalism need not \"ground its own intelligibility\". It is just the recognition that we can develop rules using the material on the Earth and make predictions over a wide range of time and space.

Most people seem to have a love/hate relationship with this method. * Zen to Done - a simplification of the GTD method. * 12 Week Year * Finish by Jon Acuff * The Art of Charm Podcast * The Productivity Show - excellent, specific advice on productivity * Kevin Kruse - Extreme Productivity - podcast seems to be over, but binge listen to this! * Pomodoro technique The Takeaway The filing system for resource materials described in GTD is golden. Basically, just alphabetically, one folder per letter. Doesn't matter whether you are filing \"pet alligators\" with \"asthma paper\" because you know close to where you need to look (e.g. is \"asthma\" under \"asthma\" or \"medical\"?). There usually isnt so much to look through that it takes long to find, and you simplify the filing so that you're more likely to do it . The \"2-minute rule\" from GTD and zTD. If it would take more less than 2 minutes to do, do it right now. To-do's should be actions not nouns Choose your MIT (Most Important Todos) each day - 3 of them - and get them done first. If it is important to do, put it on your calendar , in 15 minute blocks. Pomodoro rocks! 25 minutes, for me, seems to be a good time-period for getting a single non-trivial thing done. Trivial things (like email) can be done in 15 minute blocks. Put \"check email\" on calendar, only for 2 specific times a day and don't look at it otherwise.

We may not know how the brain manages this feat, but, so it is said, we are beginning to understand. And this new knowledge — of how the organization of bits of matter inside your head can be your personality, thoughts, understanding, wonderings, religious or sexual impulses — is surely among the most exciting and important in all of science, or so it is claimed. He believes art doesn't follow this model, But a work of art, like the meaningful world around us, is not a mere stimulus. And we work hard — we look, we ask, we think, we collaborate — to bring art and world into focus for consciousness. He then critiques neuroscience as claiming that the picture and the object are the same, The equivalency of a picture and what it depicts, however, is deeply implausible.[...]You may see a woman in the statuette. But you are not in the same state you would be in if you were in the presence of an actual woman. He continues exploring aesthetics, point out Aesthetic responses are not fixed data points but are rather like positions staked out in a conversation, continuing in our day, our lives, and in the historical time of our culture. Aesthetic responses are cultivated and nourished, and they are also challenged. Encountering a work of art is more like an evening with a friend, or an afternoon at work, than it is like the transient relishing of a flavor. Aesthetic responses are also sometimes questions that the art poses to us rather than definitive answers; they are beginnings, opportunities, not data points. In summary, Aesthetic responses, then, are not symptoms or reactions or stable quantities. They are actions. They are modes of participation. They are moments of conversation. There is nothing about which we can even ask: What are its neural correlates? And moreover, to look for neural correlates is already to have turned away from what deserves to be called aesthetic experience, for it is to have turned away from art and toward mere synaptic goings-on inside us. Response As I was reading this article, I was immediately struck by how limiting the author sees neuroscience. The \"equivalency of a picture and what it depicts\" is pretty silly - there is obviously a distinction both in and outside of the brain. We can tell the difference between a picture of an object and the object itself because internally there is a neural model which represents the object in all of the features we've experienced about the object. This neural model is activated when a sufficient number of its properties are activated - which may be associations from other areas. Seeing the 2D representation of a sculpture results in the neural model becoming active; seeing the 3D object as we walk around it also results in the neural model becoming active, perhaps even more strongly and with more associations. The article also fails to include multiple modalities. It is true that you can get visual responses from art, but even going to a museum to see paintings provides a more rich neural representation including smells, alternate visual angles, connections to stories about the piece, etc... Even within the paradigm of neural models, nothing in the experience of art is inconsistent. The idea of aesthetic responses as \"actions\" and \"moments of conversation\" is entirely consistent with the language of neural correlates. It's just an admission that most of our experience is an interplay between internal models and actions driven by the brain's representation in such a complex fashion that we can't easily summarize it. Scientifically, we can choose to isolate certain modalities - vision alone, for example - in order to understand pieces of it. The scientists aren't assuming that's all there is, but it may be all that can be described at this time - at least in quantitative detail. It would be a very interesting research project to see how the visual system is modified by learning in other areas. Do people actually see art differently when they know the context or is the visual system doing the same thing in both cases but the increased aesthetic response comes from the interaction of multiple brain areas? Far from eliminating the language of neuroscience, we should wholeheartedly embrace it.","tags":"science","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2018/Jan/10/art-scientific-reductionism-and-the-new-neuroscience/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2018/Jan/10/art-scientific-reductionism-and-the-new-neuroscience/"},{"title":"Where probabilities and theology meet","text":"We start with the article Why the resurrection data can be evidence for theism, and why arguments for resurrection need not presuppose theism – formal demonstrations . Summary of the article Definitions: \\(T\\) = theism \\(R\\) = the resurrection of Jesus \\(D\\) = specific historical data Some definitions, and initial probability assessments. The numbers are not meant to be precise but to convey overall qualitative estimates: \\(P(T) \\ge 0.01\\) which includes natural theology \\(P(\\sim T) = 1- P(T) \\le 0.99\\) - prior on atheism \\(P(R|T) \\approx 0.0001\\) - unlikely but not extraordinarily so \\(P(R|\\sim T) \\approx 0.00000001\\) - very unlikely \\(P(D|R) \\approx 0.75\\) - relatively high \\(P(D|\\sim R) \\approx 0.00000001\\) - very unlikely Now some calculations. Probability of the data on atheism \\begin{eqnarray} P(D|\\sim T) &=& P(D| \\sim T \\cdot R)P(R|\\sim T)+P(D| \\sim T \\cdot \\sim R)P(\\sim R|\\sim T) \\\\ &=& 0.75 \\cdot 0.00000001 + 0.00000001 \\cdot 0.999999999 \\\\ &=&0.00000007501 \\end{eqnarray} Probability of the data on theism \\begin{eqnarray} P(D|T) &=& P(D| T \\cdot R)P(R|T)+P(D|T \\cdot \\sim R)P(\\sim R|T) \\\\ &=& 0.75 \\cdot 0.0001 + 0.00000001 \\cdot 0.9999 \\\\ &=&0.00007501 \\end{eqnarray} From which follows \\begin{eqnarray} P(T|D) &=& \\frac{P(D|T)P(T)}{P(D|T)P(T)+P(D|\\sim T)P(\\sim T)} \\\\ &=&\\frac{0.0000751 \\cdot 0.01}{0.0000751 \\cdot 0.01 + 0.0000000751 \\cdot 0.99} \\\\ &=&0.977 \\end{eqnarray} where the prior probability for theism was \\(P(T)=0.01\\) - definitely an increase in probability given the data! The point of this argument is to \" serve as a rejoinder to those philosophers of religion who do not see the argument from miracles as supporting theism at all, or who think that one need to presuppose theism to argue for a miracle \". Further, \" I am not intending to argue that the probabilities given at the start are correct, only that it is in principle very much possible for one to argue to theism from miracle evidence \" and \" that it is also possible to argue for a particular miracle without presupposing theism. \" Two concerns with this argument Lack of well-defined propositions Probability theory only applies to well-defined propositions. Something like \\(P(T)\\) may not mean anything if the proposition theism is true , shortened to \\(T\\) is not well defined. If we are opening it up to all possible theisms, then we have to include deism, good gods, evil gods (think Cthulhu), chaotic gods (think Zeus), multiple gods (think Hinduism), gods as nature (think paganism), etc... It is unclear to me that, if you include all of that, that you can easily estimate \\(P(T)\\) . Further, quantities such as \\(P(R|T)\\) become much lower if you include all of those other pieces of theism, \\(T\\) . I may in the future go through the calculation explicitely. Lack of a connection from data to propositions What counts as \"data\" here and how does it connect to the propositions? For example, the only \"data\" I know concerning the resurrection are claims from people, years (possibly decades) after the event, from non eye-witnesses. So when Calum writes \\(P(D|\\sim R) \\approx 0.00000001\\) (very unlikely), he is clearly wrong. This sort of terrible evidence for the event is exactly what we'd expect if the event didn't happen. Also part of the \"data\" has to be what we don't see - official reports from Romans, mentions (either positive or negative) from contemporaries, physical evidence of any kind, etc... When Calum states something like \\(P(D|R) \\approx 0.75\\) (very likely), he isn't taking this into account at all. If the resurrection had actually happened, and the body was in fact missing from a guarded tomb, I would expect Paul to mention it and the trials in Acts to mention it. Here, the missing data works against the claim and the proposed probabilities.","tags":"religion","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2018/Jan/09/where-probabilities-and-theology-meet/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2018/Jan/09/where-probabilities-and-theology-meet/"},{"title":"Happy New Year (again)!","text":"As I have written before , I love the idea of New Year's Day.

His concern seems to be primarily with the idea that there should be some things that are impossible (e.g. pigs flying) and that one shouldn't even consider these claims. He then feels that people using Bayes' theorem in religious arguments are using it both to give the veneer of credibility but also so that they can attempt to justify impossible things - clearly an abuse. Although I share Loftus' concern about abusing probability, I don't think he is viewing the problem properly. For example, he introduces one form of Bayes' theorem: $$ P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} $$ but then also states Notice that the prior probability of event \"B\" cannot be zero.\" He thinks this restricts the use of the theorem, continuing with Anything that is given a zero prior probability is not the subject for Bayes' Theorem. Got it? To use it in cases where there is a zero probability is to use it incorrectly. That's the point, not that every claim has a nonzero prior probability to it. Clearly \\(P(B)\\neq 0\\) - the theorem refers to the probability of \\(A\\) given that \\(B\\) is true . It wouldn't then make any sense to have \\(P(B)=0\\) . Anyway, we are't talking about the prior probability of \\(B\\) at all so this seems like a misdirected criticism. As for claims with zero prior probability, these occur only for logically impossible claims, not simply outlandish claims. Loftus continues with \"Let's say you know one student in a class of twenty has the flu. Then the prior probability that a student in that class named Sally has the flu, is 1/20. That is your prior probability.\" Notice you have some factual information, that is, one student in a class of twenty has the flu. This is significant. First comes data, then comes prior probabilities. Bayes is dealing with factual data from the beginning. Without it there is nothing to compute. Compute? The term prior probability refers to prior to the data . But what is the data? For one problem - as with the flu case - it might be the flu test on an individual, in which case the prior to that data may include the data on general infection numbers. In the case of a coin flip, the prior probability of \\(P(H)=1/2\\) comes from the symmetry of the coin leading to the fact that relabeling the sides results in an identical state of knowledge - and thus an identical probability assignment. Sometimes there is data before the prior, sometimes not. Finally, Loftus states his biggest concern: Are the following claims logically impossible? Can I ride Disney's elephant Dumbo? When watching a Batman movie can the Joker leap out and attack me? others he adds to this list include: Can I run a one second mile today, unaided by any technology and discounting the fact that I'm running on a moving earth traveling many miles per second around the sun? Can I build a time machine before sundown today and travel back in time to prevent my grandparents from ever meeting, then come back prior to the time I built the time machine? Can I build a spaceship and travel to the moon and back before sundown today? Hell, I don't have the money to do this, nor the know-how, nor access to the fuel needed without being arrested. I don't think even NASA could do this if the head received a directive to do this completely from scratch, even with the knowledge and materials. NASA wouldn't even attempt it due to safety concerns for the astronaut(s) inside. Can pigs fly? Can they propel themselves through the sky without the aid of any technology? And for naysayers, a pig is a pig is a pig. They do not have the means to fly. And no, flying doesn't mean being thrown off a cliff, or riding in a plane. Surely we would say that we know these are impossible, in the same sense of \"know\" that Stephen Gould stated: In science, \"fact\" can only mean \"confirmed to such a degree that it would be perverse to withhold provisional assent.\" I suppose that apples might start to rise tomorrow, but the possibility does not merit equal time in physics classrooms. But how did we come to this? There are cases where people have claimed that pigs can fly, and I would bet that may children might entertain this as a possibility. It is through updating our state of knowledge to such a degree that we can demonstrate that any of these claims being true would undermine many other things we hold as true, and thus are unlikely in themselves. John Loftus is bringing a lot of background knowledge to the table, which he feels should bypass any probabilistic argument. Further, he asserts that the probabilistic arguments add nothing to it but tend to confuse the topic. Fair enough. But, what if people don't agree on a conclusion? How does one adjudicate this without some formal structure to the argument? What structures do we have access to other than probability theory? The problem with using Bayes as a tool to evaluate magical mythical miraculous claims is that there are no hard data to go by. If one wants to calculate how many Firestone tires will go bad on Ford trucks, there are data to work with. We can calculate how many tires go bad generally speaking, and how many tires go bad on trucks, etc. Then we can state the probabilities. There's data to make a probability calculation. Magic doesn't provide any data from which to calculate. Here, Loftus is in fact wrong - there is data. It turns out that the data is always of the worst kind - anecdotal. For example, when pressed, Christians will often cite Craig Keener's tome of Miracle claims. It comes in over 1100 pages! This is actual data, but science has demonstrated that it is the worst kind of data and that our standards are higher now. What is the probability that miracles are actually occurring, and yet we have zero instances of it happening in a controlled setting or in a setting where we have careful pre- and post-miracle evidence? This is an application of Bayes' theorem, whether we couch it in numerical terms or not. Loftus may be correct that in many cases Bayes' theorem is used to hide this fact, but in those cases I think it then becomes the best tool to demonstrate the fact. For those people that use Bayes to hide their poor reasoning, it is more likely that we can counter using the same tool.","tags":"articles","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2017/Oct/24/push-back-against-bayes/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2017/Oct/24/push-back-against-bayes/"},{"title":"Not all Extraordinary Claims are Equal","text":"It's the beginning of the school year and time to get back into writing and exploring interesting scientific questions, or at least exploring scientific thinking.

Here are five reasons for why I believe the claim (but not strongly) and why it is different than many other extraordinary claims: we have the word of a trained scientist, who'd be in the position to tell the difference between a hoax and something legitimate we understand that the biological mechanisms of birth are stochastic, and this sort of thing is totally within the possibility of the biology it led to the death of the hen, which is the most likely outcome in such a rare case although the prior probability of such a thing happening is small, we have many chickens in the world. It's like winning the lottery twice - it happens frequently because there are so many people playing lotteries. I'm still a little dubious, because I can't find any other corroboration, and the story is sensational enough to warrant making it up, so I wouldn't stake my life on the story. Maybe a probability of about 80 percent? Now, ask yourself, other than point (5), do we have for any ancient miracles, or for that matter any other supernatural claims, an analogous match to any of the points 1-4?","tags":"articles","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2017/Sep/05/not-all-extraordinary-claims-are-equal/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2017/Sep/05/not-all-extraordinary-claims-are-equal/"},{"title":"Do Skeptics Underestimate the Case for the Resurrection?","text":"Here's a post that has been brewing for quite a while and never really made it out. Introduction Blake Giunta is up to his usual philosophizing over at BeliefMap with a short article on \"Skeptics tend to underestimate the case\" . The argument seems to fall into two parts. The first part quote two so-called atheists claiming that the case for the resurrection was surprisingly good or hard to refute, even if they do not find it personally compelling. The second part is a quote from William Lane Craig, strawmanning an argument he had with an atheist, and stating that his opponent \"could not deny the facts of Jesus's honorable burial, his empty tomb, his post-mortem appearances, and the origin of the disciples' belief in his resurrection.\" Giunta ends with an invitation, \"Why not explore the case for Jesus's resurrection yourself?\", perhaps getting closer to God in the process. As someone who is skeptical of the resurrection myself, I am not particularly impressed when someone finds it \"extremely difficult to deal with as a critic\". It really isn't all that hard. So, the first part of the argument doesn't hold much water - and I think it is probably a rare case that well-informed skeptics find it hard to dismiss the claims of the resurrection. The argument The strongest argument for resurrection definitely comes in the form that William Lane Craig proposes, sometimes referred to as the minimal facts approach. In this approach a core handful of claims are supposedly supported even by secular scholars, and that this core inevitably leads directly to supporting the resurrection. Different people have somewhat different lists of these minimal facts, but Craig summarizes them neatly as \"Jesus's honorable burial, his empty tomb, his post-mortem appearances, and the origin of the disciples' belief in his resurrection\". A complete take-down of this approach is found in Matthew Ferguson's excellent article Knocking Out the Pillars of the \"Minimal Facts\" Apologetic . As an immediate rejoinder to the minimal facts approach is the fact that Paul, the earliest Christian writer, doesn't mention most of them - the honorable burial or the empty tomb. Paul also uses the same word for Jesus \"appearing\" to Peter and James as to \"appearing\" to himself, which calls into question whether these were actual visitations or just visions, clearly not requiring an empty tomb or any other details of the crucifixion. Further, Paul never talks about any post-resurrection stories , only visions . This, too, doesn't lend any support to the minimal facts argument because a big part of the post-resurrection appearances are in the stories. If the stories aren't true then the appearances are called into question too. Another thing to consider is that if this line of logic were applied to, say, the Roswell Incident it would be quite easy to argue for alien visitation. Given the rarity of alien visitations, as well as supernatural resurrection, I will need more than a few claims about tombs and visions to convince me that something extraordinary occurred.","tags":"articles","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2017/Jun/07/do-skeptics-underestimate-the-case-for-the-resurrection/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2017/Jun/07/do-skeptics-underestimate-the-case-for-the-resurrection/"},{"title":"Does Art Lead Math?","text":"I was sent a very interesting article on the interplay between math and art . The basic premise of the article is Does art sometimes spur mathematical discovery? There's no simple answer to this question, but in some instances it seems very likely. One example is the Tiles at the Alhambra (shown above), where we have the statements from the article, But what's fascinating about such Islamic tilings is that the work of anonymous artists and craftsmen also displays a near-perfect mastery of mathematical logic. Mathematicians have identified 17 types of symmetry: bilateral symmetry, rotational symmetry and so forth. At least 16 appear in the tilework of the Alhambra, almost as if they were textbook diagrams. The patterns are not merely beautiful, but mathematically rigorous as well. They explore the fundamental characteristics of symmetry in a surprisingly complete way. Mathematicians, however, did not come up with their analysis of the principles of symmetry until several centuries after the tiles of the Alhambra had been set in place. The implication here is that if the art work itself \"displays a near-perfect mastery of mathematical logic\" then the artist must, in some way, understand the mathematics and know that is what they are doing. I'm reminded of another math-art connection with the Pyramid of Giza . If you take, for example, the base length (230.4 m) divided by the height (146.5 m) you get \\(\\pi/2\\) out to 3 decimal places. The Egyptians show no evidence of understanding \\(\\pi\\) in other contexts, so is this evidence of advanced math on the part of the Egyptians? Probably not. All you need to do is have a process which gives you this \"coincidence\". In the case of Egyptians, all you need to do is measure heights with a standard that you use to make the size of a wheel, and then use that wheel as a standard to roll out long linear distances as is needed to measure the base of a pyramid. The consequence of geometry guarantees that \\(\\pi\\) will come in. The \"near-perfect mastery of mathematical logic\" in the Tiles at the Alhambra can be made with some simple tessellation techniques without any deep understanding of the mathematics. The other example the article raises is a Pollock painting: To those who first encountered them, the paintings of Pollock seemed chaotic and senseless. With time, however, we've come to see that they have elements of order, though not a traditional sort. Their shapes are simultaneously predictable and unpredictable, in a fashion similar to the pattern of dripping water from a faucet. There's no way to predict the exact effect of the next drip. But, if we chart the pattern of drips, we find that they fall within a zone that has a clear shape and boundaries. Such unpredictability was once out of bounds for mathematicians. But, in recent years, it has become one of the hottest areas of mathematical exploration. For example, chaos theory explores patterns that are not predictable but fall within a definable range of possibilities, while fractal analysis studies shapes that are similar but not identical. Intriguingly, mathematicians have not been able to accurately describe what Pollock was doing in his paintings. For example, there have been attempts to use fractal analysis to create a numerical \"signature\" of his style, but so far the method has not worked – we can't mathematically distinguish Pollock's autograph work from bad imitations. Again, the implication here is that the artist is somehow ahead of his time, and doing things beyond the understanding of the mathematicians. However, if Pollock is using some complex physical process to produce the painting (e.g. randomly spraying paint all over) then it is not surprising that simple mathematical models won't capture the details. This, to me, doesn't suggest a connection between art and math but rather suggests that the writer is stretching to make a connection between the two. In all of these comparisons between art and mathematics I am struck with a feeling that the writer is somehow trying to add a layer of legitimacy to the art by connecting it to mathematics or to science. I don't think this does a service to either the art or the mathematics.","tags":"articles","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2017/May/05/does-art-lead-math/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2017/May/05/does-art-lead-math/"},{"title":"Four Types of Bayesian-Frequentist Comparisons","text":"In my conversations with some of my statistics colleagues who are less familiar with Bayes methods, I came up with four categories of problems that come up in Bayesian-Frequentist comparisons. Conditional probability problems An example of this is A patient goes to see a doctor. The doctor performs a test with 99 percent reliability--that is, 99 percent of people who are sick test positive and 99 percent of the healthy people test negative. The doctor knows that only 1 percent of the people in the country are sick. Now the question is: if the patient tests positive, what are the chances the patient is sick? There are a million of these sorts of questions, and I did about 5-10 of the questions from the actuarial P test. Clearly the use of Bayes Theorem is essential in all of this, and is uncontroversial on these problems - there really isn't an alternative. If you dislike the term \"Bayesian\" here, as some textbooks seem to, you can refer to these as conditional probability problems but we're talking about the same thing. So, the difference between so-called Orthodox or Frequentist approaches and so-called Bayesian approaches to problems must lie in other types of problems. I'll note that intro stats books of all stripes include these problems, and from a Bayesian perspective they are typically limited to these types of problems. Sampling distribution of the mean My first encounter with the difference between Frequentist and Bayesian perspectives was in the \"sampling distribution of the mean\" chapter. The problem, say, is given a series of measurements of something (i.e. the mass of Saturn, the lengths of flower petals, etc…) what is the best estimate for the underlying quantity - e.g. what is the best estimate of the mass of Saturn and how confident are we in that measurement? Say, from orbital data, we get the following 10 data points for the mass of Saturn (in Earth-masses): 102, 95, 85, 86, 93, 105, 96, 91, 104, 115 What is the best estimate for the mass of Saturn, and our uncertainty in that estimate? Both Frequentist and Bayesian methods come up with \\begin{eqnarray} \\mu&=&\\bar{x} \\pm \\frac{S}{\\sqrt{N}} \\\\ \\bar{x}&=& \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{k=1}&#94;{N} x_k \\\\ S&#94;2&=& \\frac{1}{(N-1)}\\sum_{k=1}&#94;{N} (x_k-\\bar{x})&#94;2 \\end{eqnarray} The Bayesian and Frequentist approaches will come up with - numerically - the same answer to this question, but the vocabulary will be different. One speaks about the probability of the mean value, the other about the properties of the sampling distribution with respect to \\(N\\) data points. In either case, it makes no difference practically . Jaynes-type Galilean problems Where the rubber meets the road is a problem like the one proposed by Lindley, where he flipped a thumbtack and noted that sometimes it lands \"point up\" and others \"point down\". His actual data was: U U U D U D U U U U U D (9 Ups, and 3 Downs) And the question is, can we be 95% sure of this tack being an unfair tack? Given the physical properties of thumbtacks, we really don't have any expectation that it should be fair (unlike a coin, where we have a symmetry argument). We come up with different answers - quantitatively and possible qualitatively - on this one (see page 54 of the presentation on the three-sided coin I gave ) Anything with the Cauchy distribution There is one final category of problems in the comparison with Bayesian and Frequentist methods. Imagine we have a lighthouse which is off shore some known distance, B, and is located along the shore at some unknown location \\(x=a\\) : (lighthouse) * --- &#94; | B | V ————shore——————+——————————————————————> x x=a we want to estimate the location (\"a\") from a series of locations of flashes on the shore - the lighthouse is spinning around and flashing at random times. We can only observe where the flash lands on the shore, not the direction it came from. The data is, for example, the locations of these 10 flashes: -4.89, 1.03, 1.64, 1.17, 0.74, 1.46, 0.76, -7.16, 0.31, 2.48 One can show that the location of a single flash should follow a Cauchy distribution: \\(p(x|a,B) = B/(B&#94;2 + (x-a)&#94;2)\\) . This is due to the angular geometry of the problem. The question is, what is the best estimate of \"a\"? What is the uncertainty in this estimate? What methods would you employ? The Bayesian treatment for this problem is in D.S. Sivia's, Data Analysis: a Bayesian Tutorial, Second Edition (Oxford, 2006). A very similar problem is given in Think Bayes and another nice treatment is on João Pedro Neto's blog . I'm pretty sure this problem is resistant to any procedure relying on sampling distributions (as all Frequentist procedures are) due to the peculiar properties of the Cauchy Distribution . Conclusions It is important when discussing different perspectives to keep clear what the vocabulary is - what are we actually talking about? If you limit the problems to simple conditional probability problems, there isn't any difference between the Bayesian and Frequentist perspectives and one might wonder what the big deal is? However, if you expand the problem set to include limited \\(N\\) problems, with non-Normal distributions (such as Beta and Cauchy), then the differences start to become apparent.","tags":"articles","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2017/Apr/10/four-types-of-bayesian-frequentist-comparisons/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2017/Apr/10/four-types-of-bayesian-frequentist-comparisons/"},{"title":"Twitter, Zombies, and the Fate of the World","text":"Twitter, Zombies, and the Fate of the World is my presentation today at the Analytics without Borders Conference .

Enjoy! Here is a simple website which claims to read your mind: the Flash Mind Reader ! This is a pretty extraordinary claim, so I would want extraordinary evidence. It's a nice exercise in evaluating claims. First, we ask, does it do what it specifically claims to do, regardless of interpretation? . On the site, it asks you to think of a two-digit number, then do some basic math on it to get another number, which you then look up on a table. The table associates the final number with a symbol, and it is that symbol which the \"Mind Reader\" determines. So regardless of whether the interpretation is a psychic process, or some mundane process, does the process work as claimed? In many extraordinary claims of this sort, the claimant fails even at this preliminary step. This is well documented at the JREF Challenge site. However, in the case of the Flash Mind Reader , the process does seem to work! Okay, then the next step kicks in. How many ways can we think of this thing to work, and can we test them? Is it overly skeptical to not consider mind-reading in that list? I don't think so, but we could probably come up with some tests even there. For example, would it work done on a group of people all at once? If it did, that would certainly count against mind reading. Here are a few ways that I initially thought it could work, and I could quickly discount them by looking at the table, or trying it a few times. does the calculation lead to the same number each time? No! is it the same symbol each time you run it? No! do all the numbers have the same symbol? No! With a little imagination, one can come up with a probable explanation that does not involve telepathy, but it is a nice recreation of the way a scientist would address any claim, extraordinary or not.","tags":"articles","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2017/Mar/24/mind-reader-and-skepticism/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2017/Mar/24/mind-reader-and-skepticism/"},{"title":"Do we really need algebra 2 and calculus?","text":"From time to time I hear proposals to restructure math or science secondary education.

As an initial response, I thought to start with Problem 3: Random Mutations Cannot Generate the Genetic Information Required for Irreducibly Complex Structures . It starts with this uncontroversial paragraph: According to evolutionary biologists, once life got started, Darwinian evolution took over and eventually produced the grand diversity we observe today. Under the standard view, a process of random mutation and natural selection built life's vast complexity one small mutational step at a time. All of life's complex features, of course, are thought to be encoded in the DNA of living organisms. Building new features thus requires generating new information in the genetic code of DNA. Can the necessary information be generated in the undirected, step-by-step manner required by Darwin's theory? They then comment on some possible issues: However, when multiple mutations must be present simultaneously to gain a functional advantage, Darwinian evolution gets stuck. As Behe explains, \"If more than one [mutation] is needed, the probability of getting all the right ones grows exponentially worse.\" And continuing Behe, a professor of biochemistry at Lehigh University, coined the term \"irreducible complexity\" to describe systems which require many parts -- and thus many mutations -- to be present -- all at once -- before providing any survival advantage to the organism. According to Behe, such systems cannot evolve in the step-by-step fashion required by Darwinian evolution. (Wikipedia link added) Darwin himself raised the issue, \"If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down. But I can find out no such case.\" So the challenge being raised is a legitimate one - but one that requires the demonstration that such an irreducibly complex system actually exists. As far as I've ever read, every case has failed. For example, the bacteria flagellum mechanism, it is claimed, is so complex that it can't function without any of it's pieces. It fails as a motor if any of the pieces are missing, so the argument goes. However, what is commonly overlooked is that the theory of evolution merely states that the pieces have to have some function possibly (likely?) a different function for selection to work. Despite this fact, you don't see it mentioned in the discussion on flagellum in the original article, nor have I ever seen it mentioned in any critique on evolution. That omission I think is fairly telling. I think the problem as phrased is also misleading -- mutations aren't the driver of the \"Genetic Information Required for Irreducibly Complex Structures\". The selection process is the driver. The mutations are random, but the information comes from the environment. Imagine taking a million lions and dropping them randomly over the earth. Three quarters of them will drown in the oceans, another large fraction will die of cold or of heat. Only a small fraction will survive. The process that leads to their survival or not is completely non-random even while the locations of each lion is completely random. There is a lot to respond to in this article, even this one section, but this is a start. I'll keep chipping away at it because each piece of it leads to a lot of external reading.","tags":"articles","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2017/Mar/11/are-there-serious-problems-with-evolution/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2017/Mar/11/are-there-serious-problems-with-evolution/"},{"title":"Philosophy of science and the burden of proof","text":"I was just reminded about the difference between philosophy and science. I've written about this topic before here and here . This particular reminder came in the form of Blake Giunta's challenge to the argument from \"divine hiddenness\" as stated in the Unbelievable Podcast episode . A very detailed summary of the argument and the counterargument can be found on the beliefmap website . Essentially the main argument goes that a loving God who wants to be in a personal relationship with the subjects he creates would not then choose to be hidden from anyone who is non-resistant. Thus the existence of anyone willing to be in relationship with God, but isn't, demonstrates that God doesn't exist. The challenge from Blake Giunta, broken up into many different parts in categories, is essentially that God may have reasons to hide if there's a greater good. And further Blake will say that the atheist must defeat all of these possible exceptions -- show that they are all impossible -- in order to defeat his challenge. When he said this in the interview, it really struck me as shifting the burden of proof. However, he is technically correct. In a philosophical argument where you were trying to prove something you do you have to demonstrate that possible counter arguments are in fact impossible. But this isn't how we gain knowledge in the world. I've written about this before but I don't think that philosophy can produce new knowledge of things in the world. With philosophy, I can point out the possible contradictions in certain types of statements but I can never demonstrate the existence of a particular thing or phenomenon. We need science for that. So the original argument really should be recast in probabilistic terms. Given the properties of God, namely his infinite love and justice, it is supremely unlikely that he would hide himself from so many nonresistant people. Further, it would be highly unlikely that, for the people who already believe in him, he wouldn't choose to be absolutely obvious. Instead, even most believers admit that the actions of God in their life -- although sometimes seemingly palpable -- are very hard to distinguish from their own thoughts or their projections onto events. Mysterious ways. This seems unlikely in the face of an all-loving God that wants to be a relationship with his subjects. Recasting the argument in probabilistic terms modifies Blake's challenge. When he says that \"maybe God has some reason for hiding\" you can turn it around and simply ask \"what evidence do you actually have that he's there and hiding?\" or \"what evidence do you have that these reasons for hiding are in fact salient?\" Yes it's possible that God is hiding for some reasons but how have you demonstrated that these reasons are likely? One can make all sorts of excuses about why it's possible God would be hidden, but the reality is that God's actions are definitely hidden and, at best, this does not suggest the existence of a loving God. The burden of proof needs to land squarely on the person making claims about God's motivations, and providing evidence of his existence in the first place. It is not the role of the skeptic to have to disprove every possible excuse the philosopher imagines, which is why the argument is much more useful in probabilistic rather than philosophical terms.","tags":"articles","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2017/Mar/03/philosophy-of-science-and-the-burden-of-proof/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2017/Mar/03/philosophy-of-science-and-the-burden-of-proof/"},{"title":"Pascal's Wager Again","text":"I haven't written much on Pascal's Wager, but I had this small thought. Perhaps someday I'll flesh this out a bit more. Introduction In the standard Pascal's Wager, the calculation goes something like this. You have two actions: Believe in God (B) Not believe in God (~B) Then you have certain rewards and punishments, given the existence of God. If there is a God, and you believe, the reward is huge: \\(U(B|G)\\gg 1\\) If there is a God, and you dont believe, the penalty is huge: \\(U(\\sim B|G)\\ll -1\\) If there is no God, and you dont believe, no big deal: \\(U(\\sim B|~G)\\approx 0\\) If there is no God, and you do believe, perhaps you've wasted your time a bit: \\(U(B|~G) \\approx -{\\rm small}\\) So you should believe! Essentially it is an expected value problem, but what if that is not the proper calculation? Where Expected Value Breaks Down Here is an example from E. T. Jaynes (see his book here - the chapter on Decision Theory): Suppose that you are offered the following opportunity. You can bet any amount you want on the basis that, with probability ( \\(1 − 10&#94;{−6}\\) ), you will lose your money; but with probability \\(10&#94;{−6}\\) , you will win 1000001 times the amount you had wagered. Again, the criterion of maximizing expected profit says that you should bet all the money you have. Common sense rejects this solution even more forcefully. Quoting Laplace we have: [I]t is apparent that one franc has much greater value for him who possesses only a hundred than for a millionaire. We ought then to distinguish in the hoped-for benefit its absolute from its relative value. The solution is to not use the expected value of the actual money, \\(M\\) , but the log of that, \\(\\log(M)\\) . Back to the Wager So, in the case of Pascal's Wager we have a similar thing. If there is no God, then the life we have is the only life we will have. Gambling that away on the basis of poor evidence is not rational. This life has more value to the non-believer, so the possibility of a great afterlife isn't enough to offset the more likely wasting of the only life we know to actually have. It is for this reason that atheists find meaning in life, and further, they tend to find notions of an afterlife cheap and distracting.","tags":"articles","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2017/Feb/24/pascals-wager-again/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2017/Feb/24/pascals-wager-again/"},{"title":"Climate Change","text":"In this post, I am reacting to a very interesting and well researched post where a liberal argues that the climate science is not as settled as we hear . I agree with many points and am critical of other points. The overall message I think is a good one, however. This is a lot to go through so my initial thoughts may be a bit scattered as I go through pieces of this document. Let's start with some critique. The argument that temperature causes CO \\(_2\\) to increase in the past and not vice versa is a pretty terrible argument. The physics is known - they each influence each other. In the past it has been temperature that has changed due to the orbital changes, and that consequently drove increases in CO \\(_2\\) . But you can just as easily change CO \\(_2\\) directly as in burning fossil fuels and affect temperature. It's not an either-or situation so this argument is misleading. As for whether the earth was warmer a thousand years ago, I am somewhat agnostic. The tree ring data and other proxy data in my view is extremely noisy and hard to make concrete conclusions. So the uncertainty around the medieval warming period is something to be concerned about. If it was warmer 500-1000 years ago, many of the stronger claims, about climate change and how unusual the modern time period is, collapse. The statistical arguments that lead to the hockey stick are not convincing to me and are vulnerable to confirmation bias. The solar connection to temperature is weaker than what the author presents here. The recent inactive sun should have led to an actual cooling not a leveling off if the solar connection was really as strong as they are saying in this article. The correlation is really somewhat weak especially in modern times. It's still there, though, and needs to be dealt with but it is in fact dealt with in many, if not all, of the models already so this is not a strong argument. One thing where I agree with the article concerns a number of the predictions that have been made in the past concerning global warming. Many have not really come to fruition. Things like the polar bear population dropping and the increase in hurricanes and tornadoes are examples of this. These just haven't turned out to be the case. In addition, it happens that more people die from cold spells than do from hot spells which means there is at least one benefit of global warming (and there may be more). I'm not saying that it is necessarily a good thing when the climate changes or that it is overall a benefit that we are affecting the climate with our behavior. However one has to look at both the costs and the benefits of any change when trying to assess what to do about it. I find many environmentalists, although well-meaning, are one-sided and do not look for the benefits of a perceived problem. The best example I can think of is pollution. What are the costs and benefits of pollution? Environmentalists are quick to point out the costs - namely the health damages. They are not so keen on pointing out the benefits. In fact if you ask an environmentalist what the benefits of pollution are they will often look offended as if the answer is obvious… None! I'll admit that when I first heard that phrase from an economist it was a little puzzling until it was explained that the meaning of the phrase \"benefit of pollution\" is what is the \"benefit of the thing that is giving you the pollution\". So if you look at cars for example we can see that the air pollution the cars give us has a cost - the pollution's impact on health and property - but it also has some clear benefits, even for health. Namely, with cars it is easier to access healthcare, there are more rapid transportation options than with horses, etc... Ironically the advent of cars while increasing air pollution, also produced a huge reduction in water pollution due to the reduction in animal carcasses (especially in cities) and the fertilizer used for animal feed. In the same way there are both costs and benefits of climate change and we need to be clear about which they are. The Arctic ice dynamics do seem to be decreasing although the Antarctic ice seems to be increasing somewhat. Some of the predicted consequences have been overblown, however. The fact that polar bears for example, have been around for 200000 years and there have been ice free times in the arctic it during that time means that ice cover alone does not drive polar bear population declines. \"According to Bob Tisdale, a researcher I respect after reading his book Climate Models Fail, the IPCC models simply aren't skillful. They failed to predict the past twenty years, they don't realistically model the cloud response, and there is simply too much uncertainty about the inputs to get decent outputs.\" I wholeheartedly agree with this paragraph. The reason the \"pause\" is called the \"pause\" is because none of the models predicted it , even if you see it as a couple-decades long variation in the overall increase, none of the models predicted it. It lies outside of the uncertainty range given for these models. This just shows that the models have a great deal of uncertainty which is not accurately characterized. The biggest place where uncertainty plays a role it seems is in the climate sensitivity. Namely how much should we expect the temperature to change given an increase in carbon dioxide, given all of the Earth feedbacks (both positive and negative feedbacks). It seems as if most of the estimates that are done for theoretical reasons disagree with those empirically measured and always in the same direction - the theory predicts a bigger sensitivity than observed. This means that the climate sensitivity assumed in the models doesn't match the actually measured climate sensitivity. There is still a lot of uncertainty in this topic, mostly due to potential negative feedbacks like cloud cover. \"we should switch to renewable sources of energy, but for the right reasons at the right price.\" I agree with this entirely. While it may be the case that carbon dioxide is causing climate change, the uncertainty surrounding the issue makes it a harder sell in my opinion than, for example, reducing fossil-fuel use for national security. If we can wean ourselves off of fossil fuels then we might be able to remove ourselves politically from those struggles in the Middle East that seem to cause so much grief. Unfortunately the only long-term solution is nuclear power which is another discussion altogether. The section of the article which describes whom you should trust and whom you shouldn't trust smacks to me of conspiracy-theory thinking. I think you should look at all of the data and look at competing views and see for yourself on particular issues which side seems to be making more sense. Which side posts the data, and the analysis, so that you can reproduce it? What are the types of criticisms and counter arguments are presented? Look for cherry-picking and ad hominem attacks as a sign of a bad argument. I agree with most of the skepticism the author communicates and with his recommendations for reading the \"protagonist\" side, as he calls them. People like Judith Curry and Steve McIntyre, for example. However he includes people like Michael Crichton, whose novel discussing climate change is really an exercise in cherry picking. We go through the actual data in a classroom exercise and the pattern is pretty clear. So, look at all sides of an argument, examine the evidence, and look at the arguments. In addition, try to go in assuming that people intend the best - make the most charitable reading, and avoid attributing motives to the side you disagree with. On any complex issue, those that disagree with you are probably right on some level no matter what side of the argument they are on. Finally, I want to add that I can be convinced of any reasonable position - just present the evidence. So please do!","tags":"articles","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2017/Feb/17/climate-change/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2017/Feb/17/climate-change/"},{"title":"Can you guess my sign?","text":"A friend of mine who is interested in astrology claims that he can determine my astrological sign from some simple questions, and knowing me for years (although not knowing my birthday). The claim is that he can determine it \"well above random chance\". A 20% number was floated out by him, although without many specifics, and I note that this number may depend on the procedures used. Also, this sort of \\(N=1\\) exercise is not exactly compelling regardless of the result but I find it interesting nonetheless. What makes a good test? What would convince me? What would unconvince him? Of course we'd have to agree that it was a twelve sign zodiac, not the more \"accurate\" 13 sign zodiac . We'd also have to agree on tropical signs vs sidereal signs . And of course, the shift in the signs due to the changing tilt of the Earth over time . Of course, I'm not taking this concept too seriously, not because of some anti-astrological bias or prejudice. The reason I don't take astrology too seriously currently is that I have never seen any compelling evidence for astrological effects, nor have I heard any plausible mechanism for the proposed effects, and further I have seen astrological predictions that have not been demonstrated. I can be convinced if someone shows me the actual data to support it - data that doesn't collapse under scrutiny. Back to my friend...he then added that he'd prefers to rule out signs one-by-one, leaving the actual sign for last, and the exercise ends if he tries to rule out my actual sign. At first I thought this would make a difference, but if all of the questions are like \"are you typically impulsive or cautious\" I can't imagine how that could give any information about birthday. If there is no new information, then there should be no change in the probabilities. I even did a quick simulation to confirm this, although not worth posting the code, because sometimes ones intuition leads one astray when talking about probabilities. My next question for myself will be to ask: how much data does one need to take in order to tell the difference between a 20% correct astrologer and a random (about 9%) astrologer. Even at best, if my friend gets my sign wrong he still was 80% likely to do so.","tags":"articles","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2017/Feb/11/can-you-guess-my-sign/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2017/Feb/11/can-you-guess-my-sign/"},{"title":"Even if determinism were true it wouldn't matter","text":"Introduction There is a great paper Thermal noise and the emergence of the arrow of time: A simple model that illustrates the notion of the role of uncertainty in the law of increasing entropy. It starts with a very simple system of particles on a grid that can have one of 4 states - up, down, left, or right. The rules of this \"universe\" are entirely deterministic, and are the following: First, particles move in the direction they are pointing - particles pointing up move up, those pointing down move down, etc... If a particle hits the edge at this step then it reverses direction - a particle hitting the top reverses and will point down now, etc... Finally, all particles that now find themselves in a cell with two or more particles rotate 90 degrees clockwise - this represents an interaction. That's it! If you start with a system of particles, say, all on the left half this system will evolve to a state which is pretty well mixed. One way to measure this is to count the number of particles on the left-half of the box. Unscrambling the egg One thing that is interesting is that, although the system is entirely deterministic, it does lead to a well-mixed system over time - entropy increases. Another thing that is interesting is that if we were to run time backwards -- reverse all of the particles, and make the interaction rotate now counter-clockwise instead of clockwise -- we should be able to \"unwind\" the simulation back to its very ordered beginning. This is like reversing time in the universe and unscrambling an egg. Why don't we see an egg unscrambling? In the case of the real world, we never see an egg unscramble -- ever. Why? Even the slightest variation or uncertainty in the system makes the mixing not reverse. If, after the mixing, we were to randomly modify just one particle in the small, simple system described and then try to unmix it by running time backward it won't work. Even that tiniest change is enough to block us from unscrambling the egg, as shown below. First the original mixing... and then messing up one particle (can you see which one? compare \\(t=36\\) to \\(t=37\\) )...and then reversing time and trying to \"unmix\" the system. What does it mean? As I stated in a previous post , \" The key idea with free will, as described by Sean Carroll, is that we live in a world where uncertainty dominates. \" It is a practical matter that even the slightest uncertainty in the simplest and smallest deterministic system leads to the system not behaving deterministically in practice. Thus, in our own much more complex universe, we should not be overly concerned that there is theoretical conflict between \"I could have done otherwise\" and determinism. In practice, which is where we all are, it doesn't matter.

It also doesn't make the word football any less useful in describing the world at the level of human interactions. The problem occurs when you try to mix levels of description. The key idea with free will, as described by Sean Carroll, is that we live in a world where uncertainty dominates.

It is a fantastically interesting question , which I have been enjoying thinking about. It refers to a critique of E. T. Jaynes by Andrew Gelman which I comment on below. I'm working through a hard copy of your book and I stumbled upon Gelman's criticism that Jayne's for more messy datasets (people vs physics) without objective parameters might not work well. Gelman seems to take issue with Jayne's in that: The prior or model cannot be falsified and there isn't enough model checking. He is more falsificationist Gelman has a more frequentist definition of probability Cannot change, adjust or add new priors. Often impossible to know true prior…then is it ok to have a subjective one? All models are wrong in social science, but some are less wrong or more useful, so important to cycle through models. Jayne's seems to be purist and justified, whereas gelman has pragmatic approach from practice and incorporation of other philosophies. Since you have cited Gelman's book, what are your thoughts on these points? The practical implication is that I'm going to be analyzing social science data, and Gelman per those dimensions seems to make more sense, but Jayne's is more philosophically grounded. Is your book Pure Jayne's or would it work for a social scientist? I'm particularly interested in the idea of subjective priors incorporating theory or other non statistical experiments like ABM, falsifying and cycling through models etc I'm not sure Gelman is a frequentist, but he is definitely a pragmatist. He's also working with messy data. Gelman seems to be against model comparison , admitting that all of the models are in fact wrong. This reminds me of a comment Jaynes made that Ronald Fisher (the King of Frequentism) was motivated by the types of problems he was an expert in - genetics - where frequencies were the data, and populations actually existed. Gelman prefers model checking because the models he considers cannot be derived from first-principles or come from estabished quantitative theories. Compare this to Tom Loredo's paper From Laplace to Supernova SN 1987A: Bayesian Inference in Astrophysics , an article that was formative for myself. Loredo's model comparison example \"Measuring a Weak Counting Signal\" is an icon of what Gelman calls the, view of Bayesian inference as inductive reasoning (what we call here ‘the usual story') In Loredo's case, there are a number of characteristics of the problems he's investigating which are fundamentally different than the problems Gelman faces. There is a theoretical justification for the existence of, and the mathematical form of, the \"background\" effect There is a theoretical justification for the existence of, and the mathematical form of, the \"signal\" he is working with There is a reasonable justification for the prior probability The result would probably not be very sensitive to the choice of prior Many of the parameters estimated can be independently measured These characteristics of the problem have profound effects on the models and the methods for verifying them. In Gelman's case, with social science data, there are no theoretical models - he's interested only in establishing the existence of relationships. The parameters cannot be independently verified, and there are no theoretical justifications for priors. The social scientist must use qualitative correspondence with expert knowledge, knowing that it will be debatable. The parameters estimated cannot be explored directly. So, what is the social scientist to do? Spin out consequences, and compare with observations, the \"hypothetico-deductive Bayesian modelling process\". Gelman makes a big deal about induction. Perhaps I am not understanding something, but I don't see the big deal. Gelman says The common core of various conceptions of induction is some form of inference from particulars to the general – in the statistical context, presumably, inference from the observations \\(y\\) to parameters \\(\\theta\\) describing the data-generating process. But if that were all that was meant, then not only is ‘frequentist statistics a theory of inductive inference' (Mayo & Cox, 2006), but the whole range of guess-and-test behaviors engaged in by animals (Holland, Holyoak, Nisbett, & Thagard, 1986), including those formalized in the hypothetico-deductive method, are also inductive. Even the unpromising-sounding procedure, ‘pick a model at random and keep it until its accumulated error gets too big, then pick another model completely at random', would qualify (and could work surprisingly well under some circumstances – cf. Ashby, 1960; Foster & Young, 2003). So would utterly irrational procedures (‘pick a new random ! when the sum of the least significant digits in \\(y\\) is 13'). Clearly something more is required, or at least implied, by those claiming that Bayesian updating is inductive. Contrary to what Gelman is inferring here, I actually believe that the guess-and-test is in fact inductive, in addition to frequentism being inductive. What's the \"something more\" that Bayesian updating has that the others don't? It has a theoretical justification - any and all other methods that disagree with Bayesian conclusions must violate one of the listed \"deciderata\" of Jaynes. This doesn't seem to me to be a controversial statement. There are many methods of induction, but only probability theory properly followed is optimal. Bayesian approaches can also be deductive , as Gelman prefers. Deductive logic is a subset of probability theory, and that's all we're talking about here. As far as I can tell, Jaynes and Gelman are not really in disagreement.","tags":"articles","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2016/Nov/24/jaynes-vs-gelman/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2016/Nov/24/jaynes-vs-gelman/"},{"title":"Probability Does Extend Logic","text":"In the article Probability theory does not extend logic David Chapman, the author, criticizes the claim that probability theory generalizes logic to cases with uncertainty. He is particularly scornful of E. T. Jaynes' treatment of this . As far as I can see, his criticisms are misplaced. I have broken the critcisms up into into a couple of categories, and explained the problem with each. In summary, I couldn't find a specific problem where a logical conclusion was outside the domain of probability, or a specific problem where probability theory resulted in an incorrect conclusion that could be demonstrated independently. Mostly, it seemed to be a criticism of notation and the ambiguity of English. Abuse of notation Suppose you roll a die, and you believe it is fair. Then you believe that the probability it will come up as a three is 1/6. You could write this as P(3) = 1/6. People write things like that all the time, and it is totally legitimate. It might make you slightly uneasy, however. 3 is a number. It's abstract. Do numbers have probabilities? Not as such. You assign 3 a probability, in this particular context. In a different context—for example, rolling an icosahedral die—it would have a different probability. He goes on to use a more abstract example, the logician C. L. Dodgson demonstrated that some snarks—not all—are boojums. A probabilist may write this generalization as a conditional probability: \\(P(boojum|snark) = 0.4\\) The vertical bar | is read \"given\". The statement is understood as something like \"if you see a snark, the probability that it is a boojum is 0.4.\" Or, \"the probability of boojumness given snarkness is 0.4.\" Mathematicians would call this \"an abuse of notation\"; but if it is interpreted intelligently in context, it's unproblematic. Still, it's rather queer. What exactly are \"snark\" and \"boojum\" supposed to mean here? If you actually read Jaynes, he stresses pedantically that all probabilities are conditional - there is an \\(I\\) on the right-hand side in all of his equations. Most of us (lazily) drop this, but there are some paradoxes that can arise when ignored. For example, David Chapman's first example $$ P(3)=1/6 $$ should be changed to $$ P(3|I)=1/6 $$ where the \\(I\\) contains the interpretation (e.g. six-sided vs four-sided die, rolling procedure, any other knowledge we bring to the table). So the bulk of this discussion seems to be much ado about nothing. Relationships vs propositions David Chapman points out the benefits of using predicate logic to express relationships explicitly, such as Back to the cave: ∀x: ∀y: P(∃z: grue(z) ∧ near(z,x) | person(x) ∧ cave(y) ∧ in(x, y)) = 0.8 \"If a person (x) is in a cave (y), then the probability that there's a grue (z) near the person is 0.8.\" Most of what is going on this statement is predicate logic, not probability. Remember that for probability theory, propositions are opaque and atomic. As far as it is concerned, \"person(x) ∧ cave(y) ∧ in(x, y)\" is just a long name for an event that is either observed or not; and so likewise \"∃z: grue(z) ∧ near(z,x).\" It can't \"look inside\" to see that we're talking about three different things and their relationships. In practice, probability theory is often combined with other mathematical methods (such as predicate logic in this case). Probabilists mostly don't even notice they are doing this. When they use logic, they do so informally and intuitively. I am no philosopher, nor mathematician, but as far as I can tell the only \"work\" that is being done by the predicate calculus is a compact, unambiguous summary of what is expressed in English adequately. Of course, we'll often (lazily) short-hand even this to $$ P({\\rm grue}|{\\rm cave},I) = 0.8 $$ where again, the \\(I\\) includes the more verbose description. There is a balance between explicitness and economy of symbols. I still don't see the conflict - the predicate logic seems to offer nothing more in these cases. Specifics to Generalities Suppose we sequence DNA from some monsters and find that it sure looks like Arthur and Harold are both fathers of Edward: P(father(Arthur, Edward) | experiment) = 0.99 P(father(Harold, Edward) | experiment) = 0.99 P(Arthur = Harold | observations) = 0.01 This should update our belief that every vertebrate has only one father. How? Here we would be reasoning from specifics to generalities (whereas the implicit instantiation trick of Bayesian networks allows us to reason from generalities to specifics). This is outside the scope of probability theory. This is definitely wrong. What we have are experiments (i.e. data) and we have models. We could easily have models like: \\begin{eqnarray*} M_1 &=& \\mbox{every vertebrate has only one father} \\\\ M_2 &=& \\mbox{every vertebrate has either one or two fathers} \\\\ \\end{eqnarray*} and we'd want to know, \\begin{eqnarray*} P(M_1|{\\rm data},I) &=& \\cdots \\\\ P(M_2|{\\rm data},I) &=& \\cdots \\\\ \\end{eqnarray*} where the data are above. Although it could get messy, it certainly is not \"outside the scope of probability theory\". It comes down to the models. Models and Rationality David Chapman includes: Formal systems (such as logic and probability theory) are also only useful once you have a model. Where do those come from? I think it's important to go about finding models in a rational way—but formal rationality has nothing to offer. Here I agree - your inference is only as good as your models. Where did the structure of General Relativity come from, originally? From the creative process of Einstein. Models are not derived, but are created. I don't think we spend enough time celebrating the creative enterprise that is the scientific process.","tags":"articles","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2016/Nov/17/probability-does-extend-logic/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2016/Nov/17/probability-does-extend-logic/"},{"title":"Mapping Worldview to Probability","text":"I've heard many times (see here and here , for examples) the objection from apologists that certain claims (i.e. supernatural events, miracles, etc…) are ruled either impossible or highly unlikely because of the skeptics \"worldview\" - that somehow if one has a \"worldview\" that permits such things, then the evidence would look a lot different. I agree with this, and think that this is another concept which is improved by mapping it onto probability theory. For \"worldview\" read \"prior probabilities for the models under consideration\" and it becomes clear. Further, ones prior probability for a claim is just the posterior probability, given all of the evidence you've seen in the past. Bayes' Theorem written this way is \\begin{eqnarray*} P(\\mbox{model}|\\mbox{new evidence}, \\mbox{past evidence}) &\\sim& P(\\mbox{new evidence}|\\mbox{model},\\mbox{past evidence}) \\times \\\\ && \\underbrace{P(\\mbox{model}|\\mbox{past evidence})}_{\\mbox{prior}} \\end{eqnarray*} If you've been presented with evidence in the past which makes, under your state of knowledge, certain miracles more likely then you'll have a higher prior probability for a miracle interpretation of a new extraordinary claim. If you've been presented with evidence in the past which makes, under your state of knowledge, miracles less likely then you'll have a lower prior probability for a miracle interpretation of a new extraordinary claim. There is nothing wrong with this situation. However, where it goes wrong is when people think that having a high prior probability justifies the belief, or that someone with a low prior is too skeptical. The bottom line is, If your conclusion is highly sensitive to your prior probability, then your evidence is insufficient to make it reasonable to strongly believe the claim. If there is good evidence for a claim then you should be able to convince a skeptic. Excuses like, your prior probability (i.e. your \"worldview\") makes the claim less likely its just that…an excuse for the lack of evidence.","tags":"articles","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2016/Sep/06/mapping-worldview-to-probability/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2016/Sep/06/mapping-worldview-to-probability/"},{"title":"Is Science a Self-Sealing Process?","text":"In 1969, NASA faked the moon landing - there was a huge conspiracy to cover up the facts that the landing was actually filmed in Hollywood. Well, that's what the conspiracy theories claim. What about the eye-witness claims of the astronauts themselves? They must have been in the conspiracy. What about all of the people supporting the landing effort - scientists, engineers, film crews, etc…? They must have also been in the conspiracy. Conspiracy theories are examples of self-sealing ideas - any criticism can be rolled up into the theory, and either used to support the theory or to make it easy to dodge criticism. In general self-sealing ideas obstruct efforts to find the truth because they make it particularly challenging to dislodge the bad idea. As such, scientists try to make sure that all proposed explanations are falsifiable , and are thus much less likely to fall prey to this effect. Argument for the limits of science from its self-sealing methods In his debate with Matt Dillahunty on \"Did Jesus Rise From The Dead?\" , Blake Giunta's closing statement has this very clever argument for the supernatural, claiming that the methods of science itself form such a self-sealing process. He then provides two analogies to drive home the point. I have never heard anyone else make this argument, and it is challenging to see what the issue actually is, which is why it has been on the back of my mind since the first time I heard it expressed on the Dogma Debate . So here is the argument, and the two analogies. The argument starts with the statement that the basis of science is methodological naturalism - the deliberate restriction of science to natural causes for natural events. This is distinct from philosophical naturalism - the claim that the natural world is all there is. Philosophical naturalism is typically seen as not scientific, because science can never demonstrate that there is nothing beyond the natural world. However the processes of science proceed as if there is nothing beyond the natural world. So far I have no problem with this. Matt looked at the evidence put forward about the resurrection, claimed that Blake had not demonstrated supernatural cause, further claimed that there is no known demonstration of the supernatural, and that the \"facts\" surrounding the resurrection (e.g. apostle's claims to have seen the risen Jesus after he had apparently died, followed by their life reformation) probably have a natural explanations, even if we can't be sure right now what they are. Matt is perfectly correct here. Blake's argument continues here and says that Matt has chosen a self-sealing methodology that rules out, a priori, any supernatural explanations. Blake's argument is: Science has been very successful in the past in coming up with natural explanations by presupposing naturalism (i.e. methodological naturalism). We are faced with an explanation that may go beyond science (i.e. a supernatural explanation). We reject the supernatural explanation as a matter of method (i.e. methodological naturalism again). We claim that eventually we will find a naturalistic explanation. Thus, the method is sealed against any possible supernatural explanations. Analogies to the self-sealing nature of science The two analogies Blake introduces are methodological geologism and methodological Biblical inerrantism. In the former, the investigator is studying formations of rocks and presupposes geological (i.e. non-agent driven) processes - and happens to be looking at Stonehenge at the time. In the latter, the investigator is studying the claims in the Bible. Let's see how this plays out. Geology has been very successful in the past in coming up with geological explanations by presupposing geological processes (i.e. methodological geologism ). We are faced with an explanation that may go beyond geology (i.e. humans designed Stonehenge). We reject the \"humans designed Stonehenge\" explanation as a matter of method (i.e. methodological geologism again). We claim that eventually we will find a geological explanation for Stonehenge. And the other case Inerrantism has been very successful in the past in coming up with literal explanations by presupposing inerrancy in the Bible (i.e. methodological inerrantism ). We are faced with an explanation that may go beyond inerrantism (i.e. a supposed contradiction). We reject the \"supposed contradiction\" as a matter of method (i.e. methodological inerrantism again). We claim that eventually we will find a literal explanation for the contradiction (i.e. context, misinterpretation, we don't have the original, etc…). Each of these cases clearly leads to incorrect conclusions, yet the process seals itself away from the injection of the truth. Blake claims that the same problem happens with science in general - it seals itself away from the injection of the truth of supernatural claims. Where the problem lies Let's say that we decide not to declare the Bible inerrant. Where does that get us? We almost immediately make more sense of the data than would be with the presumption of inerrancy. These patterns allow us to make predictions, both about new texts we might discover, but also about the types of patterns we might not observe otherwise. If we assume that, say, the texts were copied from each other we immediately see that Mark was most likely the first Gospel, and suddenly the goals of the authors becomes more clear. It suddenly makes sense of the types of discrepancies - how, for example, could there be very detailed word-for-word correspondence on mundane details in stories and yet there can be clear deviations on things as simple to memorize as the Lord's Prayer? The disconnected two-creation stories of Genesis make sense, especially when compared to books outside the Bible which we wouldn't have considered with \"methodological inerrantism\". What about abandoning the geological processes for human-design processes? There are fields of science around the description of human-designed artifacts, fitting into the overall fields of anthropology and archaeology. If we abandon a geological description of Stonehenge and assume human design, we can make many predictions which end up being verified - whereas the same sort of predictions assuming geological processes only are either refuted or become ad-hoc when faced with Stonehenge. We would want our geologists to not waste their time on this sort of thing, and thus expect them to recognize (most of the time) structures that have been influenced by living beings and those influenced by geology. So, when we abandon the \"methodological inerrantism\" and \"methodological geologism\" we find that we can make specific predictions and realize that the method itself was too restrictive. We could cling to the method anyway, of course, but that would be a dogmatic ideological position to hold. Back to Science What happens if we try to expand our scientific inquiry to include the supernatural? Are we being dogmatic and ideological to reject it out of hand? Methodological naturalism is the resulting method when you attempt to include the supernatural, or supernatural agency, and fail…again….and again. The reason why scientists apply methodological naturalism is not that they believe that there are no possible supernatural entities, it is just that every attempt to include them has either failed or found after the fact to have diverted the attention away from the correct explanation. Further, those proposing the supernatural have never developed a method for confirming it. Unlike deviating from Biblical inerrancy, where it is immediately informative, or deviating from geology, where it is immediately informative, deviating from naturalism has never been informative. Unlike the other two analogous cases proposed, if we try to include the supernatural we don't end up with predictions, we don't end up with self-consistent explanations, and we don't end up with anything useful . Methodological naturalism is the result of trying to deviate from that method and falling flat. Methodological naturalism is used not merely for its success (as Blake contends) but also for the failure of the alternatives. In his analogous cases, the alternatives don't fail. Do we even need to interject the supernatural here? This is the final problem with the argument Blake presents. He is forced to interject the supernatural into his explanation precisely because the evidence is so weak. Consider what would convince us someone came back from the dead after three days. Pretty much some simple medical tests (EEG, EKG, etc…) after the person was dead, and perhaps for some time during the three days, and then observations afterward. We could have compelling evidence (it wouldn't have to convince everyone) for this regardless of the explanation. The explanation could be all natural - a new cure, new technology, alien intervention, etc… or we could leave it as an unknown - \"hmmmm, that's odd….\" The evidence for the event is different than the cause of the event. In the case of the resurrection, as with all other claimed miracles, we don't have good evidence that anything actually happened for us to explain, so trying to come up with a cause is premature. What we have in Blake's argument, assuming all of his best data is correct, is that some anonymous person reports years after the events that someone else claims he saw a person alive, crucified, and walking around again several days later. There is no physical evidence at all, there are no medical scans or anything that can distinguish a hundred different possibilities, and we are hearing it second-hand, years afterward, in anonymous texts which show evidence of legendary development. That wouldn't convince anyone today, and so shouldn't convince anyone about the events 2000 years ago. The only way to bring it to the point of convincing is to assume the supernatural, an assumption that has never been demonstrated to be reliable. This is an admission of defeat - the evidence for the event itself is so bad we have to assume an untestable, unreliable process that caused it. Science isn't the only show in town because it excludes the contenders as a matter of method. It is the only show in town because the contenders never showed up.","tags":"articles","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2016/Aug/19/is-science-a-self-sealing-process/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2016/Aug/19/is-science-a-self-sealing-process/"},{"title":"What Makes an Explanation Bad?","text":"In David Deutsch's TED Talk he describes what makes good and bad explanations. In particular he outlines what makes scientific explanations good ones whereas mythological ones bad. Many people claim that what makes an explanation bad is its lack of testability - goblins are a bad explanation for my car breaking down because you cannot test for goblins. Although somewhat true, this is not the primary problem with the explanation, according to Deutsch. The problem is that, even if shown to be false, the goblin explanation is too easy to vary . We can tweak it slightly to get the different prediction. The example in the talk refers to the Greek gods creating the seasons, and that one can easily modify the presumed behavior of those gods to get any result you'd like. In science, we look for explanations that one can't wiggle out of. If it is wrong, it must be discarded. The Higgs boson held a specific and irreplaceable role in the overall theory, and if not observed the theory would have to be seriously rethought and restructured. Some of the issues with string theory is that it predicts too much, and is too flexible, and thus fails as an explanation. A very similar idea I had written about before , with respect to the accounts of the resurrection of Jesus. An explanation that is too flexible becomes meaningless, and shouldn't be relied on. It's the same idea that underscores overfitting in regression and neural network models and the role of Ockam's razor.","tags":"articles","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2016/Jul/29/what-makes-an-explanation-bad/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2016/Jul/29/what-makes-an-explanation-bad/"},{"title":"Laplace and Twins","text":"From this paper, http://statweb.stanford.edu/~ckirby/brad/other/2013Perspective.pdf we have the following text: \"Controversial theorem\" sounds like an oxymoron, but Bayes' Rule has played this part for two and a half centuries. Twice it has soared to scientific celebrity, twice it has crashed, and it is currently enjoying another boom. The Theorem itself is a landmark of logical reasoning and the first serious triumph of statistical inference, yet is still treated with suspicion by a majority of statisticians. There are reasons to believe in the staying power of its current popularity, but also some worrisome signs of trouble ahead. Here is a simple but genuine example of the Rule in action (1). A physicist couple I know learned, from sonograms, that they were due to be parents of twin boys. \"What is the probability our twins will be Identical rather than Fraternal?\" was their question. There are two pieces of relevant evidence: only one-third of twins are Identical; on the other hand, Identicals are twice as likely to yield twin boy sonograms, since they are always same-sex while Fraternals are 50/50. Putting this together, the Rule correctly concludes that in this case the two pieces balance out, and that the odds of Identical are even. Note: the twins were fraternal. ... The trouble and the subsequent busts came from overenthusiastic application of the Theorem in the absence of genuine prior information, with Laplace as a prime violator. Suppose that in the twins example we lacked the \"one-third Identicals\" prior knowledge. Laplace would have casually assumed a uniform distribution between zero and one for the unknown prior probability of Identical (yielding 2/3 rather than 1/2 as the answer to the physicists' question.) In modern parlance, Laplace would be trying to assign an \"uninformative prior,\" one having only neutral effects on the output of Bayes' rule (3). The original calculation, with knowledge So, let's start with the following knowledge and some notation. we've observed twin boy sonograms, a proposition denoted as \\(S\\) 1/3 of twins are identical, thus \\(P(I) \\equiv q = 1/3\\) . You'll see why I use \\(q\\) later. We are interested in \\(P(I|S)\\) . We can derive a few related probabilities, like \\(P(S|I) = 1/2\\) . This comes from the notion that identical twins must be either BB or GG, and only half of them would give twin boy sonograms. \\(P(S|\\sim I) = 1/4\\) . This comes from the notion that fraternal twins must be BB, BG, GB or GG, and only 1/4 of them would give twin boy sonograms. Setting the calculation in terms of odds ratios (which I don't like as much as direct probabilities), we get \\begin{eqnarray} \\frac{P(I|S)}{P(\\sim I|S)} &=& \\frac{P(S|I)P(I)}{P(S|\\sim I)P(\\sim I)} \\\\ &=& \\frac{1/2 \\times 1/3}{1/4 \\times (1-1/3)} = 1 \\end{eqnarray} or 1:1 odds, and thus $$P(I|S)=1/2$$ What would Laplace do? The text refers to an \"uninformative prior\", in a derogatory way, and then proceeds to mistakenly use an informative , incorrect prior and attribute it to Laplace. Laplace, like Hume , is mischaracterized so often it really is remarkable. Let's follow through how the text gets the \\(P(S|I)=2/3\\) presumably what Laplace would do. To get this, we assume that there are two states (identical and fraternal) and that uninformative means equal probability to these states. Thus the prior is \\(P(I)=1/2\\) , and the same calculation proceeds as \\begin{eqnarray} \\frac{P(I|S)}{P(\\sim I|S)} &=& \\frac{P(S|I)P(I)}{P(S|\\sim I)P(\\sim I)} \\\\ &=& \\frac{1/2 \\times 1/2}{1/4 \\times (1-1/2)} = 2 \\end{eqnarray} or 2:1 odds and thus $$P(I|S)=2/3$$ The author then implies that this is clearly wrong, even though it does make sense that different knowledge should lead to different probability assignments. Regardless, the author calls Laplace the \"prime violator\" of the \"overenthusiastic application\" of Bayes Theorem, where Laplace \"casually assumed a uniform distribution\" for the probability of getting identical twins. However I would say that this is the correct thing to do when one has no information - to do otherwise inserts unjustified information into the system. What would Laplace really do? Let's assume Laplace is really starting from scratch, and can't even estimate the number of twins well, so he does use a uniform distribution on \\(q\\) above. The proper calculation then is to marginalize over this uniform distribution. Applying Bayes Theorem, we get \\begin{eqnarray} P(I|S) &=& \\int_0&#94;1 \\frac{P(S|I) \\cdot q}{P(S|I)\\cdot q + P(S|\\sim I)\\cdot (1-q)} P(q) dq \\end{eqnarray} As above we have \\(P(S|I) = 1/2\\) \\(P(S|\\sim I) = 1/4\\) \\(P(q) =\\) uniform from 0 to 1 and so we get (with some Wolfram Alpha magic ) \\begin{eqnarray} P(I|S) &=& \\int_0&#94;1 \\frac{1/2 \\cdot q}{1/2\\cdot q + 1/4\\cdot (1-q)} dq = 2-\\log 4 \\approx 0.614 \\end{eqnarray} again, different than our informed probability, but also different than assuming that identical twins must occur 50% of the time. Essentially, by not knowing that identical twins are actually as rare as 1/3 of all twins, we will overestimate the probability that a pair of boy sonograms would be identical - this is a good thing, not a bad one. To do otherwise would be assuming knowledge we don't have (at the time). What would Laplace do next ? Like a good scientist, Laplace would probably follow this line of logic with some data taking. Imagine he observes \\(h\\) identical twins in \\(N\\) twins, he would change his uniform distribution to a Beta distribution - just like a coin flip. The calculation now looks like: \\begin{eqnarray} P(I|S) &=& \\int_0&#94;1 \\frac{1/2 \\cdot q}{1/2\\cdot q + 1/4\\cdot (1-q)} {\\rm Beta}(h+1,N+1) dq \\end{eqnarray} which is easiest done numerically. Using the sie library from my book I have for \\(h=0\\) , \\(N=0\\) , h = 0 N = 0 d = beta ( h , N ) q = linspace ( 0 , 1 , 1000 ) dq = q [ 1 ] - q [ 0 ] pq = d . pdf ( q ) f = sum ( 0.5 * q / ( .5 * q + .25 * ( 1 - q )) * pq * dq ) print f f = 0.614 matching our analytical calculation. Now, with a modest 30 sets of twins, 10 of which are identical (consistent with our modern observations), we have h = 10 N = 30 d = beta ( h , N ) q = linspace ( 0 , 1 , 1000 ) dq = q [ 1 ] - q [ 0 ] pq = d . pdf ( q ) f = sum ( 0.5 * q / ( .5 * q + .25 * ( 1 - q )) * pq * dq ) print f f = 0.506 or within 1% of the modern value. So Laplace would have arrived at a perfectly reasonable answer prior to looking at the data and a well-informed answer within one visit to a French hospital. So, what is the objection to Bayes' Theorem again?","tags":"articles","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2016/Mar/28/laplace-and-twins/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2016/Mar/28/laplace-and-twins/"},{"title":"Student Course Evaluations","text":"I'm always interested in the process of evaluation, especially for professors. It is common to have student evaluations performed at the end of the semester, and there are endless debates about their value. I try to take the evaluations seriously, usually trying to glean some general places where I can improve things. I figured I'd try something a bit different here. I'm posting the full response to the question \"What are your comments regarding the instructor of the course?\" from one of my 200-level Weather and Natural Disasters sections. It is a course which satisfies a general education requirement at the foundational level, and typically focusses on the analysis of weather, climate, and disaster data. It introduces and reinforces notions of plotting data, regression, interpretation of data, reading contour maps, etc… It's an interesting and somewhat entertaining read. I don't take the negative evaluations personally, always trying to see the kernel of truth or where the student might be coming from. My question here is, what should I do with responses like this? You may notice a few conflicting viewpoints. Though tough and giving a lot of work, Brian Blais is always ready to help students who will ask questions. He explains the material really well, and takes his time to answer many questions in class. I sometimes had a hard time linking the different chapters we did though. But he used different ways of making us understand the class by analyzing different documentaries for example, and tried to vary the form our assignments should take which is pretty interesting. I would recommend this professor to others because he is very helpful, but would warn them that he gives a lot of work. If everyone in the class gets an answer wrong take it off the test. It may be a \"good\" question but if everyone gets it wrong then it is to good of a question. Also if everyone gets the same question wrong, maybe you should go over it more in class, so that the students actually understand the question. I spent hours on each homework assignment and it was a struggle to complete them correctly. Frustrating at times, however always available for extra help, you have to work hard to get a good grade. professor blais is smart and engaging and i really enjoy taking his class. i would recommend him to anyone, also his passion for the subject is clearly shown through his enthusiasm in class. Good guy, knows everything basically off the top of his head. Could be a bit more clear with his assignments but overall, good professor. Sometimes assumes students know more than they do. Tough to keep up. Homework is painfully difficult which he thinks is good but I just give up on them because I don't understand how to do them. Challenge is good, but sometimes too much is counterproductive to learning. It took a little while getting use to how Blais operated. A couple of times in the beginning of the semester I was taken aback at some of his statements, but it's always a truthful and very straightforward statement; something I was not used to coming from college professors. the instructor does a great job applying this class to real life situation decided to not even even use blackboard and put everything on google drive, made it much harder because it was so different then my other classes For a 200 level course that most if not all students are taking as an elective, it is extremely difficult and the material is not taught in a simple way. The lectures are all over the place sometimes and they are hard to follow. It would be more beneficial to students if you just slowed down and answered our questions. Truly awful, Answers questions with thats a good question.. why are you there if you wont answer the question. There is no need to make an science elective this hard and full of unnecessary work at a business school, we have other stuff we have to put our attention on that we actually want to learn. The instructor is a very nice person. In class I enjoyed having him as a professor. However, I believe because he is so intelligent he will explain topics rapidly with the expectation that the class understands. As a result the class is so confused that they refrain from asking questions. Further more the instructors lectures were very little help when doing home work leading to the great frustrations and long hours trying to understand the homework and figuring out solutions. Professor is a helpful and was a great resource to myself throughout the semester when questions arose. He can be really sarcastic Please give more clear answers to student's questions, rather than saying \"I don't know\" to certain questions. If you don't know can you at least try to find out, that's kind of your job...... I thought the instructor was very tough at first but if you put in the effort his teaching style is very smooth. Professor Blais seems like a pretty laid back person. However, he can sometimes be rude without realizing it, and his \"bus policy\" is the worst rule I have ever seen by a professor. Some students have appointments with advisors, etc. before his class. He should be understanding of those walking in late. Locking the door is pretty excessive, no? Assignments are too long, but his teaching ability is adequate and he clearly loves his job. I can't say I would recommend him to a friend, though. The instructor of this course is very helpful outside of the classroom, however, during class time he does not provide clear instructions for homework assignments and fails to answer students' questions clearly. Obviously the professor is very smart and really knows about what he is teaching, but how he teaches is very confusing and scattered. We sort of jump around from subject to subject so I get confused about what is related to what. The professor also doesn't answer questions clearly and ends up leaving many of us more confused than before. He does not communicate clearly what is expected for assignments so it leaves us guessing and hoping we did it right. He has a good amount of office hours available for extra help but only in the morning which is when many students are in classes so it can be difficult to meet with him outside of class. Professor Blais is often vague or flippant in answering genuine questions asked by the class and greatly underestimates how long his assignments actually take. Professor Blais is a really nice guy, considerate to students, loves what he is teaching. I think he needs to better explain the material though because we are most likely hearing all of this for the first time and might not be able to grasp the concepts and connections right away. The professor is very knowledgeable. The topics seem difficult at first, but after a few days the material becomes easier. Believes his class is the only class a student is enrolled in I have actually recommended this class to many of my friends and also the teacher. Unclear or misleading at times, but very enthusiastic about the subject. Assignments need to be improved because the course material did not connect enough between lectures and homework. Also needs to be much more organized. The grading system, well there sometimes isn't a grading system. He just distributes grades based off of aesthetic quality and relative .connection to the student","tags":"articles","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2016/Jan/15/student-course-evaluations/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2016/Jan/15/student-course-evaluations/"},{"title":"Philosophy and Science","text":"I was listening to the Dogma Debate episode \"Does God Really Love You?\" with Blake Giunta, and was really struck by the structure of the discussion. I have dealt with Blake's discussions here before , but this time it really jumped out at me what the problem was. The topic was divine hiddenness, and Blake specifically wanted to address that part of the divine hiddenness problem where God seems to be invisible in every way to non-believers - why does he hide? You can listen to the debate, jump to 44:40 where he outlines many possibilities for why God might not want to or feel the need to appear to unbelievers. They include things like \"the human might lack the right desire for God\" (e.g. to escape punishment) or \"some non-theists might form an initial proper relationship with God [if he was revealed to them] but then abandon it later on\". There is another list of responses from other philosophers Blake gives later in the show, but a more complete exploration can be found at Blake's website here . In each of these cases, the argument goes, God would have good reason not to make himself known. The response given here is essentially the same response apologists give for the problem of suffering - God may have good reasons you don't know about. Fair enough, but that doesn't give us any reason to actually believe in this being. I think it is probably true that, give the conception of God that Blake gives, there is sufficient flexibility that any and all philosophical arguments will fail - one cannot assign either a probability 1 or 0 to the existence of this God. For me, I don't really care. I want a reason to actually believe that something exists; if someone is making the claim, I want evidence. This sort of argument might be a first step - maybe God is silent because \"some non-theists might form an initial proper relationship with God [if he was revealed to them] but then abandon it later on\". Ok, but how could you test that? It may be plausible yet still false, as are most of the reasonable ideas people come up with. In science, we don't finish with the argument, we start with it and ask \"how would we know?\" I've never heard Blake, or any other apologist, take that next crucial step. How can you, through some kind of observation, tell the difference between one of these excuses being true and God simply not existing? How can you, through some kind of observation , tell the difference between the different reasons purported to explain this hiddenness - given that it is impossible they are all true in all cases.

You can read one response in the opinion piece in the NY Times . The summary is that the \"expert\" was supposedly unable to perform the following calculation: For those who may be curious about the specific math, let me lay out the numbers. The diagram had a distance the witness measured as 3 and three-sixteenths inches with a scale of 20 feet per inch. The witness said this came to approximately 68 feet. In fact it is 63.75 feet. If the expert witness had taken a few seconds to use his calculator, he could have (hopefully) come to the same conclusion. I watched the video, and can confirm that the expert should have done better, but I am not entirely convinced that this is incompetence. I could imagine someone being nervous about lawyers, feeling that the questions were going to be \"gotcha\" questions - or at least lead to that - and that you'd want a away to double-check any calculation. Although looking bad, imagine if he had tried this calculation and (through nervousness) came to an incorrect number. How bad would that look? Certainly that would have looked worse. What if he came to the correct number, but noticed the discrepancy - he'd still want to double-check the numbers through the methods he typically uses. Clearly, once he had decided that the line of questioning was just trying to \"get him\", whether he was competent or not, there was no way that he was going to budge. I think his incompetence may lay in the fact that he didn't bring the materials he needed to assess the situation quantitatively. That seems ridiculous. What sorts of lessons can we draw from this video? Always bring your materials that you need, if you're going to be questioned about the details of a result you've claimed. Be prepared to address the claims on several levels of detail - from the fully quantitative level worthy of a technical report, to a back-of-the-envelope calculation which gets close to it.

The point is that arguments are not evidence. He says that in all of the debates that he seen between atheists and theists he's never seen anyone bring up this idea which really should show that the theist has lost the debate from the beginning. I mentioned it here when I was looking at Blake Giunta debate with Matt Dillahunty. There are some things that you can learn from proofs - such as mathematical proofs. For example you may find a relationship between two things that was unintuitive at first. However I think in the case of the existence of an actual thing then you can gain no knowledge from philosophy or argumentation or proof. You really need something that's demonstrable, that's repeatable, something that gets around the biases and failings of the human thought process. I agree wholeheartedly with Mr Deity in stating that science is simply the process people use to bypass the failings of human biases. I also agree with the idea that the argument is the start , not the end, of the discussion - the argument serves as a hypothesis. 1 Given that there are a million different intuitive, simple, logically consistent, wrong hypotheses out there the effort must be made by anyone making a claim to find alternate ways of confirming the claims. .

Let me start positive, however. I really love Cosmos , and feel that Tyson is well cast as the narrator (although I will always be partial to Carl Sagan). I find, however, that Neil deGrasse Tyson commonly makes glib statements that sound smart at first but then when you think about them they aren't as profound. One such example is his list of 9 things that he doesn't understand about the movie Interstellar (serious spoilers below). Most, if not all, of them have ready answers but are presented in a glib manner. Here is the list: If you can poke through a tesseract and touch books, why not just write a note and pass it through. Stars vastly outnumber Black Holes. Why is the best Earthlike planet one that orbits a Black Hole Who in the universe would ever know the titles of all their books, from behind, on an bookshelf. How a pickup truck can drive with a flat tire among densely planted corn stalks taller than it. If wormholes exist among our planets, then why can't one open up near Earth instead of Saturn. Gotta tell you. Mars (right next door) looks waay safer than those new planets they travelled to. If you crack your space helmet yet keep fighting, the Planet's air can't be all that bad for you. Can't imagine a future where escaping Earth via wormhole is a better plan than just fixing Earth. In this unreal future, they teach unscientific things in science class. Oh, wait. That is real. Take (1), for example. If you watch the scene you'll notice that a) Cooper doesn't have any paper in the scene and b) he's in a space suit - a little challenging to write on paper, even if he had it. Seriously? Then there is (3), which is factually incorrect - he doesn't know the titles, he's punches out Morse code (backwards, of course) so that the book and spaces show the dots and dashes. Even if he needed the titles, there is a famous scene described in Gleick's book Genius where Richard Feynman and Julian Schwinger at a party both rattle off from memory the encyclopedia titles of their child-hood encyclopedia set, so that isn't completely ridiculous. On points (2), (5) and (6) - the humans had no choice in the placement of the wormhole - there could very well be a good reason for its placement - or the placement of the types of planets. In fact, if you understand the narrative, the future humans need to lead Cooper over to a black hole in order to communicate the info to the daughter. In (6), it's clear that the astronauts think these planets might be more habitable than Mars - it's only after they get there that they realize that doesn't work. In (7) is it not possible to partially crack a helmet and still remain air-tight? Is (8) even serious? Can you not imagine messing up an environent to the point where it is better to leave than to stay behind? So we're left with (4), the problem of driving a truck fast with a flat tire. Not exactly a terrible science problem, as I see it. The issue I have is that these are communicated (usally over twitter) as if they are clever, slam-dunk, obvious issues when a cursory glance at them shows otherwise.

Some of them actually do have answers, it seems, when you peel away what the question or statement actually says versus what is implied. Over the years, I've found alternate ways of looking at three of these - one came to me this week - so I thought I'd share these pearls of wisdom. Sometimes all it takes is to reframe the question. Example 1: Which came first, the chicken or the egg? This is an age-old question, designed to be imponderable - if the chicken is first, then didn't it hatch out of an egg? If the egg came first, what animal laid that egg? The answer to the question can be seen by reframing the question with a slight rewording: Which came first, the chicken or the chicken egg? That question might be imponderable, when the original one is not. Dinosaurs, as one example, laid eggs and predated chickens by millions of years. Thus, the egg came first. Example 2: That is six of one, half-a-dozen of another. This statement is clearly designed to mean something that doesn't make any difference - both alternatives are the same. However, a little reframing shows that they are not the same. Imagine I get my six or half dozen through a process of ordering food, especially at a bakery. In that context I might get 13 (a baker's dozen) and thus a \"half-a-dozen\" might yield 6.5 rather than just 6. It doesn't have to happen all the time for there still to be a difference - there is a small probability that half-a-dozen is a bit more than six. Example 3: When I was a kid, I walked to school in the snow, up hill both ways. My final example is a common phrase uttered by parents to humorously exaggerate the efforts they had to make as kids. The imponderable, of course, is how can you walk to a place and back going up hill both ways. We can see that this is indeed a possibility, if we reframe the statement a bit. I walked to school in the snow, up hill the entire way both ways. Now we can obviously see that the way to be able to go up hill both ways is if the trip involves a downhill and an uphill - you will be going up hill both ways, at some point. Now, you may find some of these a little stretched, and making much ado about nothing, but I think the lesson here is larger. Sometimes people try to frame a problem with an \"obvious\" interpretation to get you to think in a certain way. However, with an eye for the difference between stated and implied, we can come to reasonable alternatives.","tags":"articles","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2015/Sep/11/answering-unanswerable-questions/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2015/Sep/11/answering-unanswerable-questions/"},{"title":"The Giunta-Dillahunty debate","text":"I was listening to the Giunta-Dillahunty debate , \"Does God Exist?\", and the subsequent appearance of these two on the Dogma Debate show and felt there was enough there that required comment. I've commented a bit on the structure here and on the terminology here , but took down a lot more notes listening to the debate again. In this post, I refer to the debaters as Blake (Blake Giunta) and Matt (Matt Dillahunty) because it is a lot easier to type. My notes are just my responses while listening to the debate. Causation In Blake's debate he says that the Big Bang is plausibly our \"first contingent event\" and that \"this is part of the standard cosmology\" - however, he is wrong. There are many cosmological models. Some have the Big Bang as a recurrent event in an otherwise eternal universe. Some have the Big Bang as a recurrent event in a non-eternal universe, but the original event is lost to direct observation. Then there are multiverse models where the Big Bang is just one of many events. Since there are many competing models, each of which is consistent with the current observations but differ in the Big Bang being the first contingient event, one cannot state that it is plausible that the Big Bang is the first contingient event. Another thing I noticed is that Blake talks a lot about \"this causing that\" and about \"first causes\" when referring to cosmology. Sean Carroll in his excellent debate with William Lane Craig says that this sort of Aristotelean vocabulary was \"cutting edge stuff 2500 years ago\", but \"today we know better\". The entire structure of the argument doesn't resemble anything a cosmologist would say, and I tend to trust the cosmologists on issues in cosmology. Why focus so much on causation? Something like the universe may be uncaused. There are models of uncaused universes, and there are models of eternal universes - these are not a problem. Blake says that his argument \"does not require that the universe has a cause. The argument only requires that a caused universe (contingent) is the kind of thing that could exist. It's not a square-circle.\" I don't think this adds anything useful, but I'd have to go into that more with Blake. Even quantum field theory has the production of pairs of particles, apparently uncaused. If you're going to say that these particles are caused in someway, then you need to put forward a model where are you demonstrate what the causation is. The current understanding is either these effects are uncaused, or the notion of the causation vocabulary doesn't enter in. So far I've never seen a causal a model put forward. Blake states later, and is correct in saying, that model equations in physics are not causally related to anything and that's exactly Sean Carroll's point - modern cosmology doesn't use the vocabulary of causation. Philosophy as Word Salad Blake takes a lot of time talking about \"contingent\" and \"necessary\" things. An argument he uses is the following, with several alternate forms found on his website : It is possible that the first contingent thing is caused to exist. (Premise) In the possible case where the first contingent thing is caused to exist, a causally powerful necessary being must cause it to exist. (Premise) A causally powerful necessary being possibly exists. (From 1 and 2) A possibly causally powerful necessary being necessarily exists. (From 3) He refers to S5, another philosophical term I had to look up . It is a modal logic system that implies the claim that \"if something is possibly necessary, then it is necessary\". Blake talks about the necessary entity who \"can possibly cause things\" and because this entity is necessary , it can exist without space and time and that sounds \"suspiciously like God\". Further, he talks about the \"non-necessitating nature of the causation\" and thus claims that the action of this entity \"must be nondeterministic\", concluding that \"this is exactly the sort of thing we get with a free will choice.\" Blake says that the universe with all its 17 particles and all of the constants would be unlikely to be necessary itself (another version of the fine-tuning argument). However, Blake fails to realize that the same argument could've been made for the spectra of stars in the 1800's. The spectra of stars are very specific, and complex. It was known that the patterns in the complexity could be used to classify stars and even infer some of their contents . It would have been very hard to believe that all of that complexity, and the specific patterns observed, would follow from a single equation - but that is in fact what is true. This is one of the reasons why these philosophical arguments for the existence of things is unconvincing to me - I simply do not trust human intuition when I hear the universe \"must be\" a certain way. Aristotle made philosophical arguments for the existence of the four elements, the motion of objects relative to their composition, and an Earth-centered universe. We find these notions of Aristotle quaint now, not just because they were wrong (which they were) but because he never tested his ideas. That is a critical point here - you can make all the philosophical arguments you want for the existence of whatever you want but you need to close the loop and actually test something. It's not enough to show something is plausible (which I don't think Blake has even done) and that there are philosophical reasons for why you think it is there. So here is a challenge to Blake, and similar theists making these philosophical arguments. Can you give me one prediction that the philosophical models actually make? I'm not talking about something that they explain that we already know, but something we haven't seen yet that differentiates their model from other models. We ask the same for the Big-Bang cosmologists, and the multiverse cosmologists, and the string theorists. I have yet to see that even attempted by the philosophers and that is why scientists just don't take them seriously. Probabilistic thinking Blake says that conceivability is a good guide to possibility - if you can conceive of something, then it is likely that something is at least possible. His notion of \"possible\" he states is \"metaphysical possibility\" which, as a scientist, I read as \"useless possibility\". Just show me whether there is evidence for something - I don't care to know if it is possible beforehand. If you show evidence, then the notion of possibility is answered automatically. If you don't, then who cares whether something is possible? A unicorn is possible, but does anyone really care? Through purely philosophical arguments, Blake believes he has demonstrated that the prior probability of theism is high (which he of course hasn't). Then he devotes his attention to the likelihood, and focuses on the moral arena. The structure of the argument can be written mathematically like: \\begin{eqnarray} P(\\mbox{moral arena }|\\,{\\rm theism}) &\\sim& [10\\%,90\\%] \\\\ P(\\mbox{moral arena }|\\,{\\rm atheism}) &\\sim& P({\\rm universe}\\,|\\,{\\rm atheism})\\times P({\\rm life}\\,|\\,{\\rm atheism})\\times \\nonumber \\\\ &&P({\\rm consciousness}\\,|\\,{\\rm atheism}) \\times P({\\rm morality}\\,|\\,{\\rm atheism}) \\end{eqnarray} Then what happens is that, unless some of the terms in the atheist calculation are very large, the long product will give you something quite small. There are many problems with this line of reasoning, as one can imagine. First, why isn't the calculation symmetric? For example, shouldn't we really do: \\begin{eqnarray} P(\\mbox{moral arena}\\,|\\,{\\rm theism}) &\\sim& P({\\rm universe}\\,|\\,{\\rm theism})\\times P({\\rm life}\\,|\\,{\\rm theism})\\times \\nonumber\\\\ &&P({\\rm consciousness}\\,|\\,{\\rm theism}) \\times P({\\rm morality}\\,|\\,{\\rm theism}) \\\\ P(\\mbox{moral arena}\\,|\\,{\\rm atheism}) &\\sim& P({\\rm universe}\\,|\\,{\\rm atheism})\\times P({\\rm life}\\,|\\,{\\rm atheism})\\times \\nonumber\\\\ &&P({\\rm consciousness}\\,|\\,{\\rm atheism}) \\times P({\\rm morality}\\,|\\,{\\rm atheism}) \\end{eqnarray} Let's take one term, but similar things can be done with all of them. To demonstrate \\(P({\\rm universe}\\,|\\,{\\rm atheism})\\) is low, Blake brings up the fine-tuning argument and the Boltzmann Brain problem. Let's flip this around, and apply it to the theist part, \\(P({\\rm universe}\\,|\\,{\\rm theism})\\) . The universe we observe should be very unlikely on theism for at least three reasons: A perfect being is complete, and thus does not need to create anything. In fact the creation of imperfection is less than perfect, and thus cannot contribute to the greatest possible good. A perfect being need not create a finely-tuned universe, so the existence of a finely-tuned one out of all possible not-finely tuned universes is unlikely. A non-physical mind would actually prefer Boltzmann brains over brains with the particular physical limitations ours have. One can construct such arguments quite easily, which leads to Sean Carroll's observation that theism is not well defined. It also leads to my challenge above - give me an actual prediction or I don't need to take the arguments seriously. Much of the atheist side of the calculation is a hidden God-of-the-gaps argument. Blake only includes terms for which we have the least understanding, and selectively omits all the things that used to be attributed to gods but no longer (e.g. weather and disease). He is almost explicit about it, when he says that he references the list of 25 top questions in science , and focuses only on those terms which would be different between the theist and atheist models. This list is: What Is the Universe Made Of? What Is the Biological Basis of Consciousness? Why Do Humans Have So Few Genes? To What Extent Are Genetic Variation and Personal Health Linked? Can the Laws of Physics Be Unified? How Much Can Human Life Span Be Extended? What Controls Organ Regeneration? How Can a Skin Cell Become a Nerve Cell? How Does a Single Somatic Cell Become a Whole Plant? How Does Earth's Interior Work? Are We Alone in the Universe? How and Where Did Life on Earth Arise? What Determines Species Diversity? What Genetic Changes Made Us Uniquely Human? How Are Memories Stored and Retrieved? How Did Cooperative Behavior Evolve? How Will Big Pictures Emerge From a Sea of Biological Data? How Far Can We Push Chemical Self-Assembly? What Are the Limits of Conventional Computing? Can We Selectively Shut Off Immune Responses? Do Deeper Principles Underlie Quantum Uncertainty and Nonlocality? Is an Effective HIV Vaccine Feasible? How Hot Will the Greenhouse World Be? What Can Replace Cheap Oil— and When? Will Malthus Continue to Be Wrong? I could easily come up with terms which might be more likely \"on atheism\", if I wanted to approach the problem like that. Numbers 13, 14, and 15 would be pretty easy, I think. Much of this calculation, beyond being God-of-the-Gaps, simply lacks imagination. One thing that I notice about Blake is his confidence in things that are well outside of expertise. For example, he confidently says things like \"spontaneous combustion is just as common under multi-verse as anything else\" or \"there is a Boltzmann Brain problem in multiverse models\". It's clear that he does not know what he's talking about in these cases yet his level of confidence does not scale with that. Again, reference the Craig-Carroll debate . Finally, on the moral issue, I would ask Blake what properties of the moral world would not be consistent with the God as Blake describes? I'm pretty sure everything that he is arguing for is post-hoc and that there is a rationalization for nearly everything - making the definition of God so plastic as to lack simplicity (see a previous post when I talk about the notion of simplicity ). The limits of science Here's another example of the kind of arrogance of the Blake's position when he says science cannot explain the fundamental laws of nature because it requires initial conditions, and those initial conditions cannot be given or justified by science itself. I don't think this is a good argument. For example, maybe the fundamental laws will be self-explanatory. We just don't know. However, I'm certainly not about to go claiming that I know what the form of those laws is going to take. I certainly won't trust that my intuition will accurately track all the way back to the fundamental laws - they haven't been a great guide for the past 100 years in physics, why should I expect them to work in the next 100 years? In order to demonstrate the limits of science, he asks about the difference between \"methodological naturalism\" and \"methodological almost-naturalism\", where science would be correct 99.999% of the time, except for the occasional supernatural intervention. Is science limited to excluding the latter as a matter of principle? I don't think so, or at least not entirely. I've written about science testing the supernatural elsewhere, and in summary I state science cannot test supernatural explanations , because they are not defined. They can test specific predictions that incorporate unknown, and possibly unknowable, entities that have direct physical effects. In most cases of religious claims including supernatural effects there are no predictions made, and thus the term is empty and useless - an excuse for the intellectually lazy. Where specific predictions have been made (e.g. efficacy of prayer, existence of specific miracles, etc...) the predictions have not been supported. In this way, science can test God...and God has failed the test. So, again, I say to Blake - show me a prediction that almost-naturalism gives you, and then we can test it. Blake says that fundamental particles cannot have deeper mechanisms, that there is no mechanism for, say, the electron and the charge pulling or pushing on another charge. That's just flat-out wrong. There is a mechanism, part of QED , either with fields or the exchange of virtual photons. There may be a somewhat separate explanation in string theory. The problem isn't that he is wrong, but that Blake is showing his trust in philosophical arguments to try to tell us what forms physical theories must have and it just comes off wrong because he is not proposing a model , he's not making any predictions , and in my book that means he's not even in the discussion. Blake says that you can't have an infinite regress in mechanisms but I don't see how he could say that. Some infinite series actually converge. In the best theory that we know of, QED , we have Feynman diagrams including infinite number of finite interactions, but the collection gives a meaningful result. Just like the origin of the universe, I do not presume to think that my intuition will hold well for infinite things. For example, you would think the series \\(1+2+3+4+5+\\cdots\\) would not have a finite value... but it does ...and it's negative! Some theology On the topic of divine hiddenness, Blake says something like \"you have to demonstrate that God doesn't have morally sufficient reasons to stay hidden\" and I think that's really a dodge, especially given that there is basically no moral act one can think of that God couldn't do - just read the Bible for some whoppers. Another idea he proposes is that maybe you're in a position right now where you would just reject him if he showed up, or maybe more people would be saved if he doesn't show himself. Of course, as Matt pointed out, God didn't seem to have a problem with showing himself in the Bible stories. When Blake talked about these different \"theories\" (using \"theories\" in the colloquial sense, of a hunch or idea), and when he did the same thing with different notions of Hell, the first thing I thought of was \"how could you possibly confirm these?\" He makes no attempt to do so, as far as I can tell. One thing that surprised me when I was first working with biologists was the length to which the biologists would try to eliminate alternative hypotheses and to verify directly any extra elements that they were positing. If they said that some effect could be this gene expressed, then they would have to go and verify that that the particular gene not only did that function but did it in the specific case that they were looking at etc... I don't see the same thing ever happening with these theological arguments. No attempt is ever made to directly confirm the hunches. Matt states, correctly, that we always explain things in terms of other things that we understand and that \"explaining\" things in terms of things that we don't understand isn't an explanation. Robert Price puts it like \"explaining X by double-X\". Therefore, the God explanation isn't really an explanation. I would add that, because there are no predictions made, it is an unuseful idea anyway, whether you choose to call it an explanation or not. Blake says that he believes in interventionist God, so I would ask him for his evidence for the interventions, and further, for his evidence that those interventions are caused by God. On predictions...again On the origin of life, I would love to hear what predictions the Blake would make given his God model for starting life and what the researchers should look for? What should be the next test, with various proposals like RNA world or early biotic chemistry or replicating chemistry? There are predictions that these ideas make, even when they incomplete, so tell me what should we do with theistic models? To make the comparison more explicit, let's look at two examples from physics: the Higgs boson and string theory. In the case of the Higgs boson, it was proposed 50 years ago to complete a theory that already explained every known experiment to the accuracy of every known measurement. The Higgs took 50 years of very hard work to confirm, and although most scientists were confident that we'd observe it (that confidence came from the other predictions of QED ), the direct confirmation was necessary to rationally accept the model. In the case of string theory, scientists are not confident, even though there are no experiments currently which contradict it. The problem is that there are also no unique predictions from string theory which can distinguish it from others. Lacking those predictions completely undermines the confidence one has in the theory. Think about this: string theory is consistent at the equation level with our best understanding of gravity and quantum mechanics (which is way better than any theist model), and it still doesn't convince scientists due to the fact that it makes no predictions. Summary So in summary, I am not convinced at all that philosophical arguments - by themselves - can give us any knowledge of the external world. The only methods that work involve prediction, and are the methods of science. When I say science, I generally mean the rational enterprise, combined with the empirical foundation of observational science (this includes history and possibly economics, for example). As far as I can tell Blake doesn't offer any real evidence for the existence of the interventionist God, nor does he make any predictions from his theistic model. Essentially, as far as I can tell, his arguments have the same content as \"magic did it\".","tags":"articles","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2015/Aug/23/the-giunta-dillahunty-debate/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2015/Aug/23/the-giunta-dillahunty-debate/"},{"title":"Deduction, Induction, and Abduction, Oh My!","text":"As a scientist, I don't typically hold philosophy in that high regard. It has its uses, but can easily devolve into a word game with no real substance. My basic perspective is that philosophy is \"science without data\". However, in my reading and listening to debates in religious thought I come across philosophers often, and have to parse their arguments. An interesting collection of these arguments occurs in the Giunta-Dillahunty debate and subsequent appearance of these two on the Dogma Debate show . During the Dogma Debate episode, the term \"abduction\" was bandied about comparing methods of inference, including deduction and induction. I was not familiar with the term \"abduction\", and had to look it up. After much reading, it seems that the term \"abductive reasoning\" is basically needless - there is only one method of inference, and these other terms are at best subsets. First, we explore the philosopher's definitions of these terms, and then look at the proper way to describe them. ;) Definitions of Terms I'm getting the material here from the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy article on Abduction . Deduction In deductive inferences, what is inferred is necessarily true if the premises from which it is inferred are true; that is, the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion. A familiar type of example is inferences instantiating the schema All As are Bs. a is an A. Hence, a is a B. or, in other words All men are mortal Socrates is a man Therefore, Socrates is mortal. Induction Inductive inferences form a somewhat heterogeneous class, but for present purposes they may be characterized as those inferences that are based purely on statistical data, such as observed frequencies of occurrences of a particular feature in a given population. An example of such an inference would be this: 96 per cent of the Flemish college students speak both Dutch and French. Louise is a Flemish college student. Hence, Louise speaks both Dutch and French. However, the relevant statistical information may also be more vaguely given, as in the premise, \"Most people living in Chelsea are rich.\" (There is much discussion about whether the conclusion of an inductive argument can be stated in purely qualitative terms or whether it should be a quantitative one — for instance, that it holds with a probability of .96 that Louise speaks both Dutch and French — or whether it can sometimes be stated in qualitative terms — for instance, if the probability that it is true is high enough — and sometimes not. The mere fact that an inference is based on statistical data is not enough to classify it as an inductive one. You may have observed many gray elephants and no non-gray ones, and infer from this that all elephants are gray, because that would provide the best explanation for why you have observed so many gray elephants and no non-gray ones . This would be an instance of an abductive inference. That gets us to the final term, abduction. Abduction Abduction or, as it is also often called, Inference to the Best Explanation is a type of inference that assigns special status to explanatory considerations. Most philosophers agree that this type of inference is frequently employed, in some form or other, both in everyday and in scientific reasoning. [....] It suggests that the best way to distinguish between induction and abduction is this: both are ampliative, meaning that the conclusion goes beyond what is (logically) contained in the premises (which is why they are non-necessary inferences), but in abduction there is an implicit or explicit appeal to explanatory considerations, whereas in induction there is not; in induction, there is only an appeal to observed frequencies or statistics. (I emphasize \"only,\" because in abduction there may also be an appeal to frequencies or statistics, as the example about the elephants exhibits.) A couple of examples of abductive reasoning You happen to know that Tim and Harry have recently had a terrible row that ended their friendship. Now someone tells you that she just saw Tim and Harry jogging together. The best explanation for this that you can think of is that they made up. You conclude that they are friends again. and another One morning you enter the kitchen to find a plate and cup on the table, with breadcrumbs and a pat of butter on it, and surrounded by a jar of jam, a pack of sugar, and an empty carton of milk. You conclude that one of your house-mates got up at night to make him- or herself a midnight snack and was too tired to clear the table. This, you think, best explains the scene you are facing. To be sure, it might be that someone burgled the house and took the time to have a bite while on the job, or a house-mate might have arranged the things on the table without having a midnight snack but just to make you believe that someone had a midnight snack. But these hypotheses strike you as providing much more contrived explanations of the data than the one you infer to. [...] In these examples, the conclusions do not follow logically from the premises. For instance, it does not follow logically that Tim and Harry are friends again from the premises that they had a terrible row which ended their friendship and that they have just been seen jogging together; it does not even follow, we may suppose, from all the information you have about Tim and Harry. Nor do you have any useful statistical data about friendships, terrible rows, and joggers that might warrant an inference from the information that you have about Tim and Harry to the conclusion that they are friends again, or even to the conclusion that, probably (or with a certain probability), they are friends again. What leads you to the conclusion, and what according to a considerable number of philosophers may also warrant this conclusion, is precisely the fact that Tim and Harry's being friends again would, if true, best explain the fact that they have just been seen jogging together. Explanatory Virtues The article continues, In textbooks on epistemology or the philosophy of science, one often encounters something like the following as a formulation of abduction: ABD1 Given evidence \\(E\\) and candidate explanations \\(H_1\\) , \\(\\ldots\\) , \\(H_n\\) of \\(E\\) , infer the truth of that \\(H_i\\) which best explains \\(E\\) . An observation that is frequently made about this rule, and that points to a potential problem for it, is that it presupposes the notions of candidate explanation and best explanation, neither of which has a straightforward interpretation. While some still hope that the former can be spelled out in purely logical, or at least purely formal, terms, it is often said that the latter must appeal to the so-called theoretical virtues, like simplicity, generality, and coherence with well-established theories; the best explanation would then be the hypothesis which, on balance, does best with respect to these virtues. The article doesn't define these \"virtues\", and googling around isn't much clearer. A list from Richard Carrier's book Proving History is: Plausibility - \"conform to the expectations set by our background knowledge\" Ad Hocness or Simplicity - \"it must include fewer new suppositions\" Explanatory power - \"it must make the observation statements it implies more probable than any other.\" Explanatory fitness - \"must not contradict any evidence or well-established beliefs\" Explanatory scope - \"it must imply a greater variety of observation statements\" Where does this all fit together? E. T. Jaynes, in his great book on probability , starts with this example: Suppose some dark night a policeman walks down a street, apparently deserted; but suddenly he hears a burglar alarm, looks across the street, and sees a jewelry store with a broken window. Then a gentleman wearing a mask comes crawling out through the broken window, carrying a bag which turns out to be full of expensive jewelry. The policeman doesn't hesitate at all in deciding that this gentleman is dishonest. But by what reasoning process does he arrive at this conclusion? A moment's thought makes it clear that our policeman's conclusion was not a logical deduction from the evidence; for there may have been a perfectly innocent explanation for everything. It might be, for example, that this gentleman was the owner of the jewelry store and he was coming home from a masquerade party, and didn't have the key with him. But just as he walked by his store a passing truck threw a stone through the window; and he was only protecting his own property. Now while the policeman's reasoning process was not logical deduction, we will grant that it had a certain degree of validity. The evidence did not make the gentleman's dishonesty certain, but it did make it extremely plausible. This is an example of a kind of reasoning in which we have all become more or less proficient, necessarily, long before studying mathematical theories. We are hardly able to get through one waking hour without facing some situation (e.g. will it rain or won't it?) where we do not have enough information to permit deductive reasoning; but still we must decide immediately what to do. This sounds a lot like the scenarios outlined in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy article on Abduction , yet the word abduction is not found in any of the pages of Jaynes. Deduction and induction are both mentioned, yet abduction is not - why? It's because abduction is just a special case of induction , and a not a very interesting one at that. Deduction is also a special case of induction , but is worthy of the distinction. Induction vs Deduction The process of induction , or inference in general, is simply the application of the rules of probability. These are derived from a set of axioms, Degrees of Plausibility are represented by real numbers. Qualitative Correspondence with common sense. (aka consistency with deductive logic) Consistency If a conclusion can be reasoned out in more than one way, then every possible way must lead to the same result. One always takes into account all of the evidence it has relevant to a question. One does not arbitrarily ignore some of the information, basing its conclusions only on what remains. In other words, one should be completely non-ideological One always represents equivalent states of knowledge by equivalent plausibility assignments. That is, if in two problems one's state of knowledge is the same (except perhaps for the labeling of the propositions), then one must assign the same plausibilities in both. Deduction is simply this process applied exclusively to true/false propositions - essentially degrees of plausibility of 0 or 1. In this way, the total certainty of mathematical and philosophical proofs are a subset of the general inductive framework known as probability theory. The Rules of Probability Mathematically, the axioms above lead directly to a few simple quantitative rules. A very nice derivation is in Tom Loredo's article From Laplace to Supernova SN 1987A: Bayesian Inference in Astrophysics . The Definition Rule \\(P(A)\\) is a number between 0 and 1, representing the strength of belief in a statement, \\(A\\) . The Negation Rule \\begin{eqnarray} P(A) + P({\\rm\\bf not}\\, A) = 1 \\end{eqnarray} The Sum Rule \\begin{eqnarray} P(A \\,{\\rm\\bf or}\\, B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\,{\\rm\\bf and}\\, B) \\end{eqnarray} The Conjunction Rule \\begin{eqnarray} P(A \\,{\\rm\\bf and}\\, B) = P(B|A)P(A) \\end{eqnarray} Bayes Rule (derived from the Conjunction Rule) \\begin{eqnarray} P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \\end{eqnarray} These are then applied to all cases. Abduction mapped to Probability The basic idea of abduction is to find the \"best explanation\" given the data we have. This reads like the following, \\begin{eqnarray*} P(\\mbox{explanation 1}|\\mbox{data})\\\\ P(\\mbox{explanation 2}|\\mbox{data})\\\\ P(\\mbox{explanation 3}|\\mbox{data})\\\\ \\vdots \\end{eqnarray*} or with shorter notation \\begin{eqnarray*} P(E_1|\\mbox{data})\\\\ P(E_2|\\mbox{data})\\\\ P(E_3|\\mbox{data})\\\\ \\vdots \\end{eqnarray*} Then we find the one with the largest probability. Setting one of these terms up with Bayes Rule, we can see where the explanatory virtues come in. \\begin{eqnarray*} P(\\mbox{explanation 1}|\\mbox{data})=\\frac{P(\\mbox{data}|\\mbox{explanation 1})\\times P(\\mbox{explanation 1})}{P(\\mbox{data})} \\end{eqnarray*} where the denominator includes terms for all other explanations, again written with shorter notation for convenience \\begin{eqnarray*} P(E_1|\\mbox{data})=\\frac{P(\\mbox{data}|E_1)\\times P(E_1)}{P(\\mbox{data}|E_1)\\times P(E_1) + P(\\mbox{data}|E_2)\\times P(E_2)+\\cdots} \\end{eqnarray*} For any of the explanations, we have the following Plausibility - \"conform to the expectations set by our background knowledge\" - high prior probability, \\(P(\\mbox{explanation 1})\\) in the numerator. Ad Hocness or Simplicity - \"it must include fewer new suppositions\" (see below on simplicity) Explanatory power - \"it must make the observation statements it implies more probable than any other.\" - high likelihood, \\(P(\\mbox{data}|\\mbox{explanation 1})\\) especially compared to others. This appears both in the numerator and denominator of Bayes Rule. Explanatory fitness - \"must not contradict any evidence or well-established beliefs\" - must not have a low likelihood, \\(P(\\mbox{data}|\\mbox{explanation 1})\\) , in the numerator (and one term in the denominator). Explanatory scope - \"it must imply a greater variety of observation statements\" - again, high likelihood in the numerator (and one term in the denominator), \\(P(\\mbox{data}|\\mbox{explanation 1})\\) - it is higher for more data explained with the same idea. What is up with simplicity? Perhaps the concept in the process of inference which is most often mistaken, especially with apologetic arguments, is the notion of simplicity . In the debate, Blake Giunta argues that God has very few properties, and is thus simple . Simple typically means higher prior probability. However, it isn't the number of components that is important, but their flexibility. One can explain anything by saying \"magic did it\" using only one component (magic). This is simple in the sense of number of components, but not simple in the probabilistic sense. Why is that? It's because \"magic\" has a high flexibility. For a process, this can take the form of different mechanisms . For a parameter, it can take the form of different numerical values . In Loredo's article, it is phrased as Crudely speaking a complicated model can explain anything; thus, its prior predictive probability for any particular outcome is small, because the predictive probability is spread out more or less evenly among the many possible outcomes. But a simpler model is more constrained and limited in its ability to explain or fit data. As a result, its predictive distribution is concentrated on a subset of the possible outcomes. In Bayesian probability analysis, there is an automatic penalty for models with larger parameter ranges compared to models with narrow ranges (see Mackay here for one treatment). Blake Giunta's \"simple\" definition of God is anything but - it is so ill-specified as to be consistent with nearly any result in the world. The \"fewer new suppositions\" definition of Ad Hocness may work, but it doesn't work for the virtue of Simplicity. Bayesian probability analysis captures both. Final Thoughts As far as I can tell, the term abduction is an unnecessary term. It seems to me to be just a renaming of induction and doesn't add anything useful to it. The explanatory virtues are themselves somewhat ad hoc and not properly specified, and where they are they are a trivial consequence of the well-specified process of induction. I had never heard of abduction, except in the realm of Christian apologetics, which makes me wonder what purpose it serves there that properly doing induction doesn't. Perhaps it lets one distance oneself from the extremely low prior probability of the claims made, and focus on fancy sounding terms like \"explanatory power\" and \"ad hocness\".","tags":"articles","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2015/Aug/10/deduction-induction-and-abduction-oh-my/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2015/Aug/10/deduction-induction-and-abduction-oh-my/"},{"title":"Evidence vs Argument","text":"I was listening to the Giunta-Dillahunty debate , \"Does God Exist?\", and the subsequent appearance of these two on the Dogma Debate show , and was struck by the structure of the argument. Blake Giunta seems to be confident that philosophical arguments can be used as evidence for the existence of God when scientific procedures fail. Although much of the discussion involves what counts as evidence, the notion of probability and knowledge, and the role of the supernatural in inference, there is a more basic question that is never brought up. I would love to hear even one case of the existence of an entity that was ever best described only in philosophical terms, or an entity whose existence we could at some point be confident in through only a philosophical argument. It seems that if you are asked for your best evidence for the existence of something, and you present only a philosophical argument, then you are conceding that you have no data . If someone asked for the best evidence for Neptune, you'd show the Voyager pictures and the pictures from telescopes. If it were 100 years ago, you'd show telescopic traces in the sky. If it were 200 years ago, one might be able to give a philosophical argument about the simplicity of 8 planets instead of 6, or the possibility of large gas giants other than Jupiter and Saturn, but one would never be justified in a strong belief in such an entity with such arguments. Blake Giunta also commented that \"before you can give evidence for what God did in the world you first have to demonstrate possibility [of his existence].\" He does this with the philosophical arguments, but again this is misguided. If someone asks for your evidence for the existence of something, and you give a philosophical argument for its possibility you are conceding defeat. Why not present the evidence of the existence? That itself will answer the possibility question - if I present pictures of Neptune from the Voyager mission, the question of the possibility of Neptune's existence becomes moot.","tags":"articles","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2015/Jul/28/evidence-vs-argument/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2015/Jul/28/evidence-vs-argument/"},{"title":"Pluto, Pluto, Here We Come","text":"In anticipation of the New Horizons close flyby of Pluto in a little over a week on July 14, 2015, I read with interest the article \" Calculating Pluto's Mass With Snapshots From New Horizons \". This is totally something I would do with my students, although I would have done it a little differently. Both my approach and theirs are perfectly fine, and come to equivalent answers. The difference is in which concepts are stressed. Assumptions and Data Using their numbers for the following: \\begin{eqnarray*} \\mbox{Period of Orbit}&=&3.2 \\mbox{days} \\\\ \\mbox{Distance between Pluto and Charon}&=&r=1.957\\times 10&#94;{4} \\mbox{km} \\end{eqnarray*} I, like the authors of the article, would prefer to calculate this distance using angular distances of the image but I'll use the short-cut they used in the article for expediency. Kepler's Law My first deviation uses Kepler's Law , or rather, Newton's version of Kepler's Law . The simplest looking version of this equation uses units of AU for the distances, Solar Masses for the total mass of the orbiting bodies, and years for the period. In this form, Kepler's Law looks like: $$ T&#94;2 [\\mbox{years}] = \\frac{r&#94;3 [\\mbox{AU}]}{M_{\\rm total}[\\mbox{solar masses}]} $$ This law basically says that more massive systems, or more tightly bound systems, orbit faster. In this case the units are a little inconvenient. Newton's form uses meters, seconds, and kilograms - which also can involve a number of conversions, making it easier to lose track of the concepts. I prefer an intermediate form, with a conversion factor out front to take care of units. This form looks like: $$ T&#94;2 [\\mbox{days}] = \\frac{r&#94;3 [\\mbox{km}]}{M_{\\rm total}[\\mbox{kg}]} \\times 7.9\\times 10&#94;{10} $$ From this, and the data above, we can arrive at the total mass of the Pluto-Charon system directly as: \\begin{eqnarray*} M_{\\rm total}[\\mbox{kg}] &=&\\frac{r&#94;3 [\\mbox{km}]}{T&#94;2 [\\mbox{days}]}\\times 7.9\\times 10&#94;{10}\\\\ &=&\\frac{\\left(1.957\\times 10&#94;{4}\\right)&#94;3 [\\mbox{km}]}{3.2&#94;2 [\\mbox{days}]}\\times 7.9\\times 10&#94;{10}=1.44\\times 10&#94;{22} {\\rm kg} \\end{eqnarray*} Notice this number is a bit higher than the mass of Pluto, coming in at \\(1.3\\times 10&#94;{22} {\\rm kg}\\) . That's because the mass calculated here is the total mass of the Pluto-Charon system, so it is \\(M_{\\rm total} = M_{\\rm Pluto}+M_{\\rm Charon}=1.44\\times 10&#94;{22} {\\rm kg}\\) . To get the masses separately, we bring in the concept of the center of mass. Center of Mass From the video in the original article , you can see that Charon orbits about a little \"x\" in the middle in a big circle, and Pluto orbits about that same \"x\" in a smaller circle . That \"x\" marks the point in space of the center of mass of the two. It's like two ice skaters holding on to each other as that spin in a circle - each one going in a circle. If the two are the same size, then the center of their spinning is right in the middle of the two. If one of the skaters is more massive, then the lighter person spins in a larger circle and the heavier person is pulled only slightly and spins in a smaller circle. The relationship that they exhibit, mathematically, is $$ m_1 r_1 = m_2 r_2 $$ or the product of their masses and the sizes of the circles is the same for both - the more massive object orbits in a smaller circle. For Pluto and Charon, we can draw these circles from the images taken from the frames of the movies - I used Keynote, but you can use any drawing program. Even by eye you can see that the size of Pluto's circle is about 1/8 that of Charon's. So, from the center of mass, we have \\begin{eqnarray*} M_{\\rm Pluto} r_{\\rm Pluto} &=& M_{\\rm Charon} r_{\\rm Charon} \\end{eqnarray*} or, rearranging and measuring off of the image, \\begin{eqnarray*} \\frac{M_{\\rm Charon}}{M_{\\rm Pluto}}&=&\\frac{r_{\\rm Pluto}}{r_{\\rm Charon}} \\\\ &=&\\frac{1}{8} \\end{eqnarray*} Putting it together So we finally have, from Kepler's law, $$ M_{\\rm Pluto}+M_{\\rm Charon}=1.44\\times 10&#94;{22} {\\rm km} $$ and from center of mass, \\begin{eqnarray*} \\frac{M_{\\rm Charon}}{M_{\\rm Pluto}}&=&\\frac{1}{8} \\end{eqnarray*} This leads to \\begin{eqnarray*} M_{\\rm Pluto}+\\frac{1}{8}M_{\\rm Pluto}&=&1.44\\times 10&#94;{22} {\\rm kg} \\end{eqnarray*} or \\begin{eqnarray*} M_{\\rm Pluto}&=&1.28\\times 10&#94;{22} {\\rm kg} \\end{eqnarray*} very close to the \"right\" answer. Of course, the \"right\" answer was obtained in exactly the same way, just being more careful. In fact, this is how we know nearly all of the masses of astronomical entities, from planets to stars to galaxies.","tags":"articles","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2015/Jul/03/pluto-pluto-here-we-come/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2015/Jul/03/pluto-pluto-here-we-come/"},{"title":"Football Physics","text":"In another post , I outlined how the drop in pressure was entirely consistent with what was measured with the laws of physics. That post was done when the only data was the drop in pressure - nothing specific about the methods, or the data. Then the 243 page Wells report came out with the methods and the data, as well as a sophisticated statistical report (see the Appendix A, page 229). Once I saw (one page 231 (A-2)) that the pre-game pressures were \"Assumed Pressure at Start of Game\", I realized that there was nothing that the report could say. The fact that there weren't measurements taken at the beginning of the game invalidates nearly any analysis. I was going to leave it at that, and possibly explore the problem as an introductory statistics problem, but basically dropped it. Then, I was forwarded this critical analysis of the Wells report by the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) and my interest piqued again. There is a nice New York times piece to go along with the detailed report . Suddenly it became clear that: the methods used in the Wells report were unorthodox, and basically incorrect there is another alternative explanation for their finding that the Colt's footballs were significantly more inflated than the Patriot's footballs - physics again! From the Wells report plots, the \\(1/e\\) time constant of a football going from one equilibrium pressure to another with a change in temperature comparable to that observed on the day is about 10 minutes. What I hadn't realized in my initial analysis was that the Patriots' footballs were measured first during the half-time, and the Colts footballs measured afterward - right at the end of half-time. This is a delay of about 10 minutes. This leads to the following two consequences: The Patriots' footballs are measured when they are the lowest pressure, or near lowest pressures, right after coming in from the cold. The Colts' footballs are measured when they have had an ample chance to warm up by the end of half-time. A delay of 10 minutes would bring the pressure up to about 66% of the distance from the cold temperature equilibrium pressure to the high temperature equilibrium pressure given the measured \\(1/e\\) time constant of the football. It would be closer to 75% if the delay is nearly a full 15-minute half-time. You don't even need to throw in some confusion about which gauge was used a the beginning of the game vs the middle of the game (with a difference of 0.4 psi!). You easily have a situation where, plausibly, all footballs could have been in regulation at the beginning of the game yet end up with one set higher pressure on average than the other in the middle of the game - even with no foul play. Frankly, I've found this so-called sophisticated quantitative analysis a great example of a smoke screen for alternative motivations. Finally, I want to add that although I am not convinced that the Patriots cheated, I am also not convinced that they didn't. However, the burden of proof (as in the court of law) lies squarely with the prosecution, not the defense - and they have clearly not made their case.","tags":"articles","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2015/Jun/24/football-physics/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2015/Jun/24/football-physics/"},{"title":"We find God \"not guilty\" of existing","text":"I was listening to the Unbelievable podcast on the definition of atheism, whether it is \"lack in a belief in God\" or \"believing that God does not exist\" or something else, which got me thinking about how it maps to probability (as I always do). Matt Dillahunty clearly defines atheism as a lack of belief, and in a court-room analogy says that he finds God \"not guilty of existing\". In court, you find the plaintiff \"guilty\" or \"not guilty\", not \"guilty\" or \"innocent\". The burden of proof lies squarely with the prosecution. If they haven't met that burden, then the jury finds the plaintiff \"not guilty\". They may, or may not, believe that the plaintiff is innocent. Establishing innocence in the crime changes the burden of proof to the defendant. The difference here comes down to priors, which we can see through some illustrative examples mapped to probability. Odd and Even Stars Are there an odd number of stars in the universe or an even number? Clearly, at any single point in time, there is a correct answer this question. Given our lack of knowledge, we should have $$ P(O)=P(E)=\\frac{1}{2} $$ If someone were to claim that there was very likely an odd number of stars, we'd ask for evidence. If that evidence is not persuasive, $$ P(O|{\\rm evidence}) \\sim P(O) $$ then we would certainly lack a belief in the odd-ness of the number of stars yet we would not say that we \"believe there is not an odd number of stars\". It is up to the odd-number supporter to provide the evidence to raise our prior probability significantly above \\(P(O)=0.5\\) - they have the burden of proof. Different Data If we imagine data that might actually affect this prior probability, the situation is a bit different. Let's imagine that through the laws of physics we could demonstrate that stars are nearly always formed in pairs single stars are very short-lived we may actually have an argument for an even-number of stars in the universe. In this case, we have $$ P(O|{\\rm data}) \\ll P(O) $$ and thus $$ P(E|{\\rm data}) \\gg P(E) $$ Where one belief goes down, the other goes up. For our belief in odd-ness to go down our belief in evenness must go up. We no longer simply lack a belief in odd-ness, we now both believe in even-ness and believe in non-odd-ness. More than two outcomes Something interesting happens when there are more than two outcomes. $$ P(H)=P(R)=P(Y)=\\frac{1}{3} $$ Some data that nearly rules out one hypothesis, say \\(R\\) , may not speak to either other hypothesis directly, so you get the equal redistribution like: \\begin{eqnarray} \\nonumber P(R)&\\sim& 0 \\\\ \\nonumber P(H)=P(Y)&\\sim& 1/2 \\end{eqnarray} or it might be the case that the data leaves unchanged the prior probability of one of the hypotheses, raising the probability of the other, like \\begin{eqnarray} \\nonumber P(R)&\\sim& 0 \\\\ \\nonumber P(H)&\\sim& 1/3 \\\\ \\nonumber P(Y)&\\sim& 2/3 \\end{eqnarray} Notice that it is possible to reduce the probability of one hypothesis (i.e. \\(R\\) ) and not effect the probability of a separate hypothesis (i.e. \\(H\\) ), when there are more than two outcomes. It is also possible for the probability of that separate hypothesis (i.e. \\(H\\) ) to go up, or even go down. In other words, when there are more than one hypothesis, presenting evidence for (or against) one hypothesis does not always guarantee an adjustment in another hypothesis down (or up). Back to court So, in court, the jury is tasked to decide \"guilty\" or \"not-guilty\", rather than \"guilty\" or \"innocent\". Why are these not the same? Because the claim is that the accused is \"guilty\" (like \"oddness of stars\"), so the evidence needs to be established for the claim. A jury deciding \"not-guilty\" is saying that $$ P({\\rm guilty}|{\\rm evidence}) \\sim P({\\rm guilty}) $$ and the evidence is not convincing. Back to God The atheist is just that person who is unconvinced by the evidence, $$ P({\\rm God}|{\\rm evidence}) \\sim P({\\rm God}) $$ not the person who believes there is no God, $$ P({\\rm God}|{\\rm evidence}) \\ll 0.5 $$ Atheists find God \"not guilty\" of existing","tags":"articles","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2015/May/18/we-find-god-not-guilty-of-existing/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2015/May/18/we-find-god-not-guilty-of-existing/"},{"title":"On Miracles","text":"After my post about the misquoting Hume and the miraculous, I was recommended to read the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy article on miracles where it supposedly explains why \"Hume was toast\" before any misquoting of him. In this post, I hope to sketch the relevant parts of the encyclopedia article, and demonstrate how it does not establish any significant deficiency of Hume. I use the same headings as the article on miracles to make it easier to follow. Concepts and Definitions The article begins by discussing one of Hume's definitions of a miracle as \"a violation of the laws of nature\". From what I can tell, their main critique is they don't like the connotations of the word \"law\", a perspective I share - it is a bit loose terminology, with too many alternate meanings to be the foundation of a well-defined argument. Their revised definition is the following: A miracle is an event that exceeds the productive power of nature Perhaps this is the scientist in me, and why I am not a philosopher, but I don't see a striking difference between these two definitions in at least how they are used. So it seems reasonable to adopt this as a good working definition. They go on to clarify a subset of miracle, a religiously significant miracle is a detectable miracle that has a supernatural cause. This clarification is to deal with the following problem, and I'd agree with at least the sentiment. An insignificant shift in a few grains of sand in the lonesome desert might, if it exceeded the productive powers of nature, qualify as a miracle in some thin sense, but it would manifestly lack religious significance and count not be used as the fulcrum for any interesting argument. I am not sure how, in practice, one would be able to determine a \"supernatural cause\", let alone establish how an event could be beyond the \"productive power of nature\" without committing a fallacy of argument from ignorance , but let's leave that for now. Arguments for Miracle Claims This section starts with a quick list of the types of evidence and arguments made for miracles. Many arguments for miracles adduce the testimony of sincere and able eyewitnesses as the key piece of evidence on which the force of the argument depends. But other factors are also cited in favor of miracle claims: the existence of commemorative ceremonies from earliest times, for example, or the transformation of the eyewitnesses from fearful cowards into defiant proclaimers of the resurrection, or the conversion of St. Paul, or the growth of the early church under extremely adverse conditions and without any of the normal conditions of success such as wealth, patronage, or the use of force. These considerations are often used jointly in a cumulative argument. It is therefore difficult to isolate a single canonical argument for most miracle claims. The various arguments must be handled on a case-by-case basis. All of these pieces of so-called evidence are the worst kind of evidence, for which there are countless examples of the same, or similar evidence use to shore up the claims of other (presumably false) beliefs. You can think \"Mormonism\" or \"Alien Abductions\" for nearly every point listed. They then outline two types of inductive arguments: the conclusion (in this case that the miracle in question has actually occurred) is probable to some specific degree, or at least more probable than not the conclusion is more probable given the evidence presented than it is considered independently of that evidence Point (1) is just either specifying either \\(P({\\rm miracle}|{\\rm data})\\) directly or establishing only that \\(P({\\rm miracle}|{\\rm data})>0.5\\) . Point (2) is \\(P({\\rm miracle}|{\\rm data})>P({\\rm miracle})\\) . Point (2) is nearly useless. For example, you could have \\begin{eqnarray*} P({\\rm miracle})&=&0.00001 \\\\ P({\\rm miracle}|{\\rm data})&=&0.001 \\end{eqnarray*} and still have a seriously unlikely hypothesis, even given a factor of 100 increase in probability of a miracle given the data. Thus the only thing that matters must be the actual value of \\(P({\\rm miracle}|{\\rm data})\\) . One such argument for miracles specifies the type of evidence needed to make one confident that one is talking about a miracle. The article calls this a \"criteriological\" argument, but all of the arguments dealt with are probabilistic. What are the criteria, for example? This one is from Charles Leslie: That the matters of fact be such, as that men's outward senses, their eyes and ears, may be judges of it. That it be done publicly in the face of the world. That not only public monuments be kept up in memory of it, but some outward actions to be performed. That such monuments, and such actions or observances, be instituted, and do commence from the time that the matter of fact was done. One can easily site both the golden plates of Joseph Smith, and also the events surrounding Roswell, that satisfy all of these. Clearly, there is an issue with them. Another common argument is called the \"minimal facts\" approach. The best summary, and take-down of this argument is on Matthew Ferguson's blog . One essential missing part of the minimal facts approach is that it only includes likelihoods and not priors , and thus fails a basic probabilistic analysis. Probabilistic arguments The first form here deals with testimony , with the following assumptions and conventions: \\(T_i\\equiv\\) the proposition \"Witness \\(i\\) testifies to \\(M\\) \" \\(P(T_i,T_j) = P(T_i)\\times P(T_j)\\) : independence \\(P(T_i|M)=P(T_j|M)\\) for all \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) : all testimony is equally informative We then easily derive: $$ \\frac{P(M|T_1,T_2,\\cdots,T_n)}{P(\\sim\\!M|T_1,T_2,\\cdots,T_n)} = \\left(\\frac{P(T_1|M)}{P(T_1|\\sim\\!M)}\\right)&#94;n \\times \\frac{P(M)}{P(\\sim\\!M)} $$ The article then spins this in a positive way toward miracles: [I]f independent witnesses can be found, who speak truth more frequently than falsehood, it is ALWAYS possible to assign a number of independent witnesses, the improbability of the falsehood of whose concurring testimony shall be greater than the improbability of the alleged miracle. (Babbage 1837: 202, emphasis original; cf. Holder 1998 and Earman 2000) However, comparing with Hume, it becomes obvious why this spin fails: When anyone tells me, that he saw a dead man restored to life, I immediately consider with myself, whether it be more probable, that this person should either deceive or be deceived, or that the fact, which he relates, should have really happened. I weigh the one miracle against the other; and according to the superiority, which I discover, I pronounce my decision, and always reject the greater miracle. If the falsehood of the testimony would be more miraculous, than the event which he relates; then, and not till then, can he pretend to command my belief or opinion. (Hume) The first quote implies that the terms \\(P(T_1|M)\\) and \\(P(T_1|\\sim\\!M)\\) refer to speaking truth vs falsehoods (i.e. lying), as opposed to speaking correctly vs being mistaken. In the latter, it is very easy to see why, for certain types of extraordinary events, we would expect fallible observers to have \\(P(T_1|\\sim\\!M)>P(T_1|M)\\) and further that even if witnesses were in general slightly more reliable than not, we can't expect the observations to be independent in general. In the specific case of the (anonymous) Gospel writers, there is strong evidence of dependence in the accounts to make this entire calculation (except in its gross qualitative features) irrelevant. Arguments against miracles Quoting Hume again, The plain consequence is (and it is a general maxim worthy of our attention), \"That no testimony is sufficient to establish a miracle, unless the testimony be of such a kind, that its falsehood would be more miraculous, than the fact, which it endeavors to establish: And even in that case, there is a mutual destruction of arguments, and the superior only gives us an assurance suitable to that degree of force, which remains, after deducting the inferior.\" This is correct, and is a direct statement of Bayesian reasoning $$ \\frac{P(M|E)}{P(\\sim\\!M|E)} =\\frac{P(E|M)}{P(E|\\sim\\!M)} \\times\\frac{P(M)}{P(\\sim\\!M)} $$ where we can use the approximations \\(P(E|M)\\approx 1\\) and \\(P(\\sim\\!M)\\approx 1\\) and achieve $$ \\frac{P(M|E)}{P(\\sim\\!M|E)} \\approx \\frac{P(M)}{P(E|\\sim\\!M)} $$ The article on miracles continues to try to map this to a philosophical structure (needlessly, I'd say), with the following \"simple version\" of the argument: A very simple version of the argument, leaving out the comparison to the laws of nature and focusing on the alleged infirmities of testimony, can be laid out deductively (following Whately, in Paley 1859: 33): 1) Testimony is a kind of evidence very likely to be false. 2) The evidence for the Christian miracles is testimony. Therefore, 3) The evidence for the Christian miracles is likely to be false. This is, however, much too crude an argument to carry any weight, since it turns on a simple ambiguity between all testimony and some testimony. Whately offers an amusing parody that makes the fallacy obvious: Some books are mere trash; Hume's Works are [some] books; therefore, etc. It's remarkable that such a silly parallel is seriously made. The structure isn't really parallel at all, so let's make it explicit: Books are likely to be trash. (in other words, most books are trash) Hume wrote some books therefore, Hume's books are likely to be trash. This is a correct argument, given the premises. If all we knew was that \"some guy named Hume\" wrote \"some book\", then with all probability (if premise 1. is correct) that book would be trash. The issue is that, unconsciously, we are inserting extra information - Hume was a famous philosopher, he had a particular education, etc... With this extra information, we would have a hard time supporting a similar premise as 1. above. The fact that this is so trivially dispensed with makes one wonder - why would anyone be convinced by this? Why couldn't the author of the article see it? It smacks of grasping at straws to try to dispel Hume's main arguments. The article continues with some odd re-phrasings of Hume, where the mathematics is just the single line above. I don't understand all the work. A strange one is then critiqued with an even stranger statement: The presumptive case against the resurrection from universal testimony would be as strong as Hume supposes only if, per impossible , all mankind throughout all ages had been watching the tomb of Jesus on the morning of the third day and testified that nothing occurred. Even aside from the problems of time travel, there is not a single piece of direct testimonial evidence to Jesus' non-resurrection. Does anyone seriously think that the case against a claim always (or even usually) takes the form of direct testimony against that claim? Where is the testimony that Zeus didn't exist? Anyone who can explain this odd line of reasoning, please chime in. Particular Arguments According to the article, Hume lists a set of conditions needed to make testimony carry maximum weight: [T]here is not to be found, in all history, any miracle attested by a sufficient number of men, of such unquestioned good sense, education, and learning, as to secure us against all delusion in themselves; of such undoubted integrity, as to place them beyond all suspicion of any design to deceive others; of such credit and reputation in the eyes of mankind, as to have a great deal to lose in case of their being detected in any falsehood; and at the same time attesting facts, performed in such a public manner, and in so celebrated a part of the world, as to render the detection unavoidable: All which circumstances are requisite to give us a full assurance in the testimony of men. (Hume 1748/2000: 88) Essentially, he is saying that the methods of science have never confirmed a miracle. The methods of science help \"secure us against all delusion in themselves\", remove \"suspicion of any design to deceive others\", with processes \"performed in a public manner\" that \"render the detection unavoidable\". It is criticized by noting that some of these conditions can cut the other way, such as the condition of \"credit and reputation\", It might have been said with some shew of plausibility, that such persons by their knowledge and abilities, their reputation and interest, might have it in their power to countenance and propagate an imposture among the people, and give it some credit in the world. (Leland 1755: 90–91; cf. Beckett 1883: 29–37) This is, essentially, pointing out fallacy of authority - a good critique. Science, by its processes, attempts to avoid that as well. Of course, Hume predates modern science, so I think we can forgive him some sloppiness or poor choice of terminology. Hume continues to suggest that the religious context of the miracle claime makes the telling of the miracle story even more likely. This would increase the probability of obtaining the testimony even if no miracle happened - \\(P(E|\\sim\\!M)\\) increases - making the probability of a miracle go down. The criticism here? The effect could happen in the other direction: But as George Campbell points out (1762/1839: 48–49), this consideration cuts both ways; the religious nature of the claim may also operate to make it less readily received: [T]he prejudice resulting from the religious affection, may just as readily obstruct as promote our faith in a religious miracle. What things in nature are more contrary, than one religion is to another religion? They are just as contrary as light and darkness, truth and error. The affections with which they are contemplated by the same person, are just as opposite as desire and aversion, love and hatred. The same religious zeal which gives the mind of a Christian a propensity to the belief of a miracle in support of Christianity, will inspire him with an aversion from the belief of a miracle in support of Mahometanism. The same principle which will make him acquiesce in evidence less than sufficient in one case, will make him require evidence more than sufficient in the other…. I disagree quite strongly with this line of thinking. One of the big problems with pseudoscience is that it promotes poor thinking in other domains. Someone who believes in miracles will not find it hard to believe that the miracle claims of other religions are at least possible. If you believe in unseen agents, then to move from Christianity to New Age to Scientology isn't that large of a stretch. Often, when ones religion is undermined, the typical response is to switch to another religion! Thus, they are not as opposite as \"light and darkness\". Poor thinking is poor thinking, regardless of the context. Argument from Parity Hume brings up miracles in other religions. In a fit of special pleading, the article on miracles retorts, All attempts to draw an evidential parallel between the miracles of the New Testament and the miracle stories of later ecclesiastical history are therefore dubious. There are simply more resources for explaining how the ecclesiastical stories, which were promoted to an established and favorably disposed audience, could have arisen and been believed without there being any truth to the reports. The argument is quite simple - if there are known cases of miracle claims where no miracle actually occurred, that increase \\(P(E|\\sim\\!M)\\) , making the probability of a miracle go down given testimony. It doesn't matter whether you have good reasons to believe there was no miracle for these cases - it undermines testimony of miracles in general. In conclusion So, as far as I can tell, there is no substantive critique to Hume's statements about miracles. He lacks the rigor of the mathematics of probability, but his wording is so straightforwardly translated to it that I find it difficult to see what the problem is. I also found it ironic that the entire article, which has been pro-miracle the entire time, ends with this: For the evidence for a miracle claim, being public and empirical, is never strictly demonstrative, either as to the fact of the event or as to the supernatural cause of the event. It remains possible, though the facts in the case may in principle render it wildly improbable, that the testifier is either a deceiver or himself deceived; and so long as those possibilities exist, there will be logical space for other forms of evidence to bear on the conclusion. Arguments about miracles therefore take their place as one piece—a fascinating piece—in a larger and more important puzzle. This is pretty much exactly what Hume was saying. Given that there is always a non-zero probability of the testifier either lying or being mistaken, one has to establish the evidence for a miracle strong enough to overcome both the negligibly small prior probability and this non-zero probability of the testimony being wrong. Since mistakes are a common human trait, and distortions are also common on testimony, evidence for miracles according to probability theory, Hume, and all rational thought have always been found lacking. Of course, if you could demonstrate it otherwise, please let me know! I'd love to believe in miracles. I just have never seen anything even remotely convincing.

The core of the article is in the third paragraph: But there's something missing in their critiques, something fundamental. For all their eloquence, their arguments are often banal. Regrettably, they've shown little interest in understanding the religious compulsion. They talk incessantly about the untruth of religion because they assume truth is what matters most to religious people. And perhaps it does for many, but certainly not all – at least not in the conventional sense of that term. Religious convictions, in many cases, are held not because they're true but because they're meaningful, because they're personally transformative. New Atheists are blind to this brand of belief. Another gem: Of course, most religious people consider their beliefs true in some sense, but that's to be expected: the consolation derived from a belief is greater if its illusory origins are concealed. The point is that such beliefs aren't held because they're true as such; they're accepted on faith because they're meaningful. Seriously? Just ask yourself, if you swapped out \"religion\" in the texts above, and inserted astrology, witchcraft, alien visitation, scientology, 911 Truther or Anti-vaccination, would the author still have such a glib response to the lack of evidence? These all give their adherents meaning, a feeling of belonging to something greater than themselves, or an importance to themselves that they wouldn't otherwise have. Who are we to criticize these? They \"consider their beliefs true in some sense\" but gain some \"consolation derived from the belief\", and thus these \"beliefs aren't held because they're true as such; they're accepted on faith because they're meaningful\". Essentially Sean Illing is saying that it doesn't matter whether the belief is true, it only matters if it makes you feel good. Of course he excludes himself from these false notions with \"many people (myself included) find no practical advantage in believing things without evidence. But what about those who do?\" What a patronizing and arrogant thing to say! Seems like he's projecting a bit. Does Sean Illing not see the dangers in this line of reasoning? It does matter if people believe things without evidence. It does matter that, even in the cases where the belief is \"content free\", that the believers are using the same vocabulary as the fanatics - and thus provide intellectual cover for the fanatics. It does matter that believing in something merely because it gives you meaning, or makes you feel good, is a bad idea. How much legitimate meaning could be derived from beliefs that are not well supported by evidence? This is the message of the so-called New Atheists, and it is not arrogant.","tags":"articles","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2015/May/12/its-not-the-new-atheists-that-are-arrogant/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2015/May/12/its-not-the-new-atheists-that-are-arrogant/"},{"title":"Expressing Ignorance","text":"I continue with my critique of the article Why I am not a Bayesian by Greg Mayer, where complains about the Bayesian approach to inference, and then espouses Maximum Likelihood methods. My previous post looked at the notion of prior vs likelihood, why we commonly use priors (even without always knowing it), and why they are necessary for hypothesis comparison. Here I wanted to focus on what I consider to be his biggest issue with the Bayes approach, and it is technical in nature. It happens to be the same issue that I've heard from others - how to specify priors. Mayer goes further, and says that the specification of ignorance is not well defined. I admit that there may be cases where that is true, but I haven't seen a convincing one yet. In the article he outlines the following argument against specifying initial ignorance with a prior: Let's look at simple genetic example: a gene with two alleles (forms) at the locus (say alleles \\(A\\) and \\(a\\) ). The two alleles have frequencies \\(p + q = 1\\) , and, if there are no evolutionary forces acting on the population and mating is at random, then the three genotypes ( \\(AA\\) , \\(Aa\\) , and \\(aa\\) ) will have the frequencies \\(p&#94;2\\) , \\(2pq\\) , and \\(q&#94;2\\) , respectively. If I am addressing the frequency of allele \\(a\\) , and I am a Bayesian, then I assign equal prior probability to all possible values of \\(q\\) , so \\(P(q>.5) = 0.5\\) But this implies that the frequency of the \\(aa\\) genotype has a non-uniform prior probability distribution \\(P(q&#94;2>0.25) = 0.5\\) . My ignorance concerning \\(q\\) has become rather definite knowledge concerning \\(q&#94;2\\) (which, if there is genetic dominance at the locus, would be the frequency of recessive homozygotes; as in Mendel's short pea plants, this is a very common way in which we observe the data). This apparent conversion of ‘ignorance' to ‘knowledge' will be generally so: prior probabilities are not invariant to parameter transformation (in this case, the transformation is the squaring of \\(q\\) ). And even more generally, there will be no unique, objective distribution for ignorance. Lacking a genuine prior distribution (which we do have in the diagnosis example above), reasonable men may disagree on how to represent their ignorance. As Royall (1997) put it, \"pure ignorance cannot be represented by a probability distribution\". This example intrigued me because of its simplicity - it must have some solution. It also gave me an excuse to play with plotly, the online plotting program and emcee: The MCMC Hammer , both of which I had been meaning to get some practice in. Summary In summary, Probability is a measure of our state of knowledge . If we gain new information about our system, our state of knowledge changes, and thus the probabilities we assign must change. Humans are bad an intuiting where information comes from in some cases, and thus often mistakenly think that two problems are equivalent when they are not. Mayer's critique of priors with this genetic example is an example of point (3), and we outline that with a model analogy. In sum, the \"apparent conversion of ‘ignorance' to ‘knowledge'\" that Greg Mayer is so concerned about is in fact not just apparent - it is explicit. This is not due to some arcane mathematics on priors, but to added information . What Mayer's considers to be equivalent situations - knowledge of only two possible states, and knowledge of the process that produces those states - are not equivalent at all. The Model - Part 1 The model that I'm using comes in two steps. The first step concerns the observation of a system with two states, call them \\(+\\) and \\(-\\) , and we want to infer from the observations of these states what the underlying probabilities, denoted \\(\\theta_+\\) and \\(\\theta_-\\) respectively, are. The observed data is something as simple as the number observed in one state vs the other, such as \\begin{eqnarray*} N_+ &=& 16 \\\\ N_- &=& 4 \\\\ N&\\equiv& N_+ + N_- = 20 \\end{eqnarray*} The solution to this is achieved with a straightforward application of Bayes' rule: \\begin{eqnarray*} P(\\theta_+|{\\rm data}) &=& P({\\rm data}|\\theta_+)\\times P(\\theta_+)/K \\\\ P(\\theta_-|{\\rm data}) &=& \\underbrace{P({\\rm data}|-)}_{\\rm likelihood}\\times \\underbrace{P(\\theta_-)}_{\\rm prior}/K \\end{eqnarray*} with normalization constant \\begin{eqnarray*} K\\equiv P({\\rm data}|\\theta_+)\\times P(\\theta_+) + P({\\rm data}|\\theta_-)\\times P(\\theta_-) \\end{eqnarray*} and where the data is defined as \\begin{eqnarray*} {\\rm data}&\\equiv & \\left\\{ N_+,N \\right\\} \\end{eqnarray*} or equivalently \\begin{eqnarray*} {\\rm data}&\\equiv & \\left\\{ N_-,N \\right\\} \\end{eqnarray*} Although analytical solutions exist for this problem, I'll solve it with MCMC both to work on my implementation, but also to see how this could be applied to more challenging cases. To do this, we specify the log-prior and log-likelihoods for our parameters. Prior Notice that we know nothing about the origin of these states or the process which gives rise to these states, we only observe how many there are. Thus, we have total ignorance of the \\(\\theta_-\\) parameter, and we assign a uniform prior probability to reflect that. $$ P(\\theta_-) = \\left\\{\\begin{array}{cl}1 & \\mbox{ for } 0 \\le \\theta_- \\le 1 \\\\ 0 & \\mbox{ otherwise } \\end{array}\\right. $$ Likelihood Since this is a straightforward Bernoulli process, we have for the likelihood $$ P({\\rm data}|\\theta_-) = \\left(\\begin{array}{c}N \\\\ N_- \\end{array}\\right) \\theta_{-}&#94;{N_-}\\times (1-\\theta_-)&#94;{N-N-} $$ Result The resulting posterior for \\(\\theta_-\\) is Again, clearly there is an analytic solution to this part, but that isn't the point. And I'm not sure whether the second part has an easy solution, but the MCMC approach is just as easy. Model - Part 2 The second step in the model is when we get some detail of the process by which the \\(+\\) and \\(-\\) states are generated. Here is the recipe: I flip a two identical thumbtacks, each of which can land with the point up ( \\(U\\) ) or down ( \\(D\\) ) - and I don't know anything about the probability of these two cases. If either (or both) of the tacks lands with the point up, that is reported as the \\(+\\) state. The only remaining case (i.e. both tacks land pointing down), is reported as the \\(-\\) state. We have, then, the following mapping: \\(UU \\rightarrow +\\) \\(UD \\rightarrow +\\) \\(DU \\rightarrow +\\) \\(DD \\rightarrow -\\) The parallel with alleles should be obvious. By keeping it to a simple physical model, I avoid the extra complexities of genetic inheritance, and other biological processes. This model, again, is a basic problem in probability, but note the following very important point: Our knowledge of the system has changed, so our probabilities must also change. The only difference is that our ignorance is now on \\(\\theta_U\\) and \\(\\theta_D\\) , and the probabilities for the \\(+\\) and \\(-\\) states are derived from that, \\begin{eqnarray*} \\theta_- &=& \\theta_D&#94;2 \\\\ \\theta_+ &=& 1-\\theta_- \\end{eqnarray*} Now we have posterior for the underlying parameters, such as \\(\\theta_D\\) , as well as for the state parameters, such \\(\\theta_-\\) , which are determined entirely from the underlying parameters. The posterior for \\(\\theta_D\\) is while the posterior for \\(\\theta_-\\) in the Model 2 is Comparisons and conclusions It's a bit more convenient to plot the consequences of Model 1 (ignorance in +/-) and Model 2 (ignorance in U/D), with the same data, both together on the same plot. We can easily see that, although they are different, there is no practical difference between them given this data. For larger \\(N\\) this difference gets less significant. In sum, the \"apparent conversion of ‘ignorance' to ‘knowledge'\" that Greg Mayer is so concerned about is in fact not just apparent - it is explicit. This is not due to some arcane mathematics on priors, but to added information . What Mayer's considers to be equivalent situations - knowledge of only two possible states, and knowledge of the process that produces those states - are not equivalent at all. In practice, for this problem, it makes very little difference whether you think of things in terms of Model 1 or Model 2 except in the case of extremely rare underlying events. This is also as it should be - if you know that the process essentially hides the existence of itself (i.e. the recessive gene is not observed phenotypically) - then you would assign a lower probability for the phenotype than you would if you only knew that there were two possible states and knew nothing about the properties of recessive characteristics. To repeat, different states of knowledge require different probability assignments - this is a feature, not a bug.","tags":"articles","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2015/May/09/expressing-ignorance/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2015/May/09/expressing-ignorance/"},{"title":"Priors vs Likelihoods","text":"I was reading the article Why I am not a Bayesian where Greg Mayer complains about the Bayesian approach to inference, and espouses Maximum Likelihood methods. There is much to critique in the article, but let's consider one question he raises. There are three ways round the problem of prior distributions. First, try really hard to find an objective way of portraying ignorance. This hasn't worked yet, but some people are still trying. Second, note that the prior probabilities make little difference to the posterior probabilty as more and more data accumulate (i.e. as more experiments/observations provide more likelihoods), viz. P(posterior) ∝ P(prior) × Likelihood × Likelihood × Likelihood × . . . In the end, only the likelihoods make a difference; but this is less a defense of Bayesianism than a surrender to likelihood. Third, boldly embrace subjectivity. But then, since everyone has their own prior, the only thing we can agree upon are the likelihoods. So, why not just use the likelihoods? The problem with Bayesianism is that it asks the wrong question. It asks, ‘How should I modify my current beliefs in the light of the data?', rather than ‘Which hypotheses are best supported by the data?'. Bayesianism tells me (and me alone) what to believe, while likelihood tells us (all of us) what the data say. I follow his question of \"why not just use the likelihoods\" with the following question: Given that Paul the Octopus predicted 12 out of 14 World Cup matches, does Greg Mayer accept that the octopus is psychic? Why or why not? My guess is \"no\", but why? The likelihood (i.e. how well the hypothesis supports the data) is exceptionally high. Higher, I'd say, than nearly any other hypothesis. Actually, now that I think about it, the hypothesis \"aliens that like the number 12 and influence octopi made it happen\" is a better one. These are clearly ridiculous because they are implausible to start, and thus have a lower prior probability . In fact Bayesianism is asking the only interesting question, and it provides the framework to actually compare hypotheses, something that frequentist methods fail spectacularly at. Greg Mayer is a Bayesian, he just fails to admit it.","tags":"articles","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2015/May/05/priors-vs-likelihoods/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2015/May/05/priors-vs-likelihoods/"},{"title":"Superseding the $t$ test","text":"There's a very nice paper, Bayesian estimation supersedes the t test .

T. Jaynes wrote extensively about Bayesian inference, and one of his strategies was to use a \"Galileo's telescope for statistics\", such as outlined in his paper on Confidence Intervals vs Bayesian Intervals . This method is used to distinguish between two alternate approaches to a problem. The strategy entails finding particularly simple cases where the two cases yield very different answers, and the correct one is obvious from the context and the simplicity of the problem. In this way, the difference is magnified like a telescope so that it is clear to the unaided observation. There are, I've found, similar sorts of cases in apologetics. There are a few questions I've heard that are so simple, yet get to the heart of the matter. I've collected them here, and always enjoy finding others. Is there free will in Heaven? If there is, then the free-will argument for the the Problem of Evil falls apart. If there is not, then heaven is filled with automatons and the soul is meaningless. How did Paul know it was Jesus that he saw? Since Paul wasn't an eyewitness to Jesus, how did he know that he was being visited by Jesus in a vision? How does he know that he saw the same person that others saw? Thus, even at best, how do we know as readers that his testimony is reliable at all, as the apologists claim? How did you determine in the Bible that God is the good guy and Satan is the bad guy? This one points to the real source of morality - ourselves. We use our own moral intuitions to decide which parts of the Bible are worth keeping and which to ignore. Even if you look at the beginning of Genesis, the snake is the one that is correct about the Tree of Knowledge when God is not. Using the argument that God's book says that God is good is, obviously, fallacious. Why does Paul never use the word disciple and only uses the word apostle? This one isn't quite as strong, but it was the one that got me thinking about the evidence (or lack of evidence) for the existence of Jesus. This simple question highlights the fact that Paul never mentions anything about the life of Jesus at all. He doesn't seem to be aware that Peter and James, for example, were supposedly disciples of of Jesus - following an actual person - not just apostles - spreading the word about Jesus. He never mentions Nazareth, or anything at all that Jesus said - not a single quote from Jesus is found in any of Paul's writing, and he is the earliest and most prolific New Testament writer. I find that really interesting. For me, it makes me agnostic about Jesus existing at all as a historical figure. I've never seen a compelling case either way. Are there any more such questions?","tags":"articles","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2015/Mar/03/simple-questions-that-get-to-the-heart-of-the-matter/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2015/Mar/03/simple-questions-that-get-to-the-heart-of-the-matter/"},{"title":"Misquoting Hume","text":"I recall a comment in E. T. Jaynes' book about Laplace, where he realized that most of the arguments against the claims of Laplace were arguments against things Laplace never said. Jaynes would habitually check the original source whenever he heard claims ascribed to Laplace, and found that Laplace was consistently misquoted. Recently, I have realized that the same can be said of Hume. I've written before about the claim that Hume believed we have \"no good reason at all for thinking the sun will rise tomorrow\" (spoiler alert: he didn't believe this). So, I've seen this little pithy Hume quote: \"The evidence for the regular is always greater than that for the rare.\" in various critiques of Hume on the web . The problem? Hume never says this. You can read Hume's actual statements about miracles in the two parts of his argument here: part 1 and part 2 . The misquotes that I have seen are always from Christian apologists, so it isn't totally surprising. I think one of the reasons this occurs is that Hume predates probability theory, so he uses verbose explanations where the modern reader can insert a single statement. For example, reading Hume's work on Miracles, it is clear to me that what he intends to say is simply the prior probability for the regular is always greater than the rare a bit less pithy, but more correct (although Hume doesn't phrase it quite like that either). This is at least a factual statement - before the data, we should believe the regular over the rare. That doesn't imply that data couldn't convince us of rare events, it only implies that it is more difficult for data to convince us of rare vs regular events (i.e. you need better evidence for the rare). In an Unbelievable podcast interview with apologist Norman Geisler , Geisler uses the first \"quote\" of Hume above, and then argues that Hume must be wrong because science already accepts singular and rare events - the Big Bang, the origin of life, and macro evolution (this last one is, of course, neither singular nor rare). Geisler then concludes that miracles can exist! However, seen in the light of probability theory, it becomes clear. The prior probability of the events is low: \\begin{eqnarray} P(\\mbox{Big Bang})\\ll 1 \\\\\\\\ P(\\mbox{Origin of Life})\\ll 1 \\\\\\\\ P(\\mbox{Macro Evolution})\\ll 1 \\\\\\\\ P(\\mbox{Miracles})\\ll 1 \\end{eqnarray} but with data, we have something quite different: \\begin{eqnarray} P(\\mbox{Big Bang}|{\\rm data})\\sim 1 \\\\\\\\ P(\\mbox{Origin of Life}|{\\rm data})\\sim 1 \\\\\\\\ P(\\mbox{Macro Evolution}|{\\rm data})\\sim 1 \\\\\\\\ P(\\mbox{Miracles}|{\\rm data})\\sim 0 \\end{eqnarray} where the data are Big Bang - a long list Origin of Life - a nice summary with RNA world, and autocatalysis Macro Evolution - a term not used by biologists, but another long list for evolution Miracles - nothing convincing to the scientific community So, although all these things can occur, only a few of them actually have evidence strong enough to overcome their initial low prior probability. Hume recognized this for miracles, as was clear from his writings, although it would have been clearer had he had the benefit of probabilistic vocabulary. Don't take my word for it, go read Hume here , and here .","tags":"articles","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2015/Feb/21/misquoting-hume/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2015/Feb/21/misquoting-hume/"},{"title":"Testing the Supernatural","text":"In an interesting paper entitled \" Can Science Test Supernatural Worldviews \", Yonatan Fishman proposes an unusual answer of \"yes\". I've spoken to this issue here and again here , where I refer to the term \"supernatural\" as a label-of-the-gaps, and trace its usage in ancient cosmology. I've stated that the term itself is either content-free or not defined specifically enough to be useful. However, I do make the following statement which I think points to Fishman's perspective: I'd love to see something that really rises to the level of a miracle, like the 10 commandments etched in Pluto or something. Although technically a God-of-the-Gaps argument, it would be very interesting indeed! We can ask the question, what would convince you of the existence of the supernatural, or of God? Fishman points out that if prayer actually worked, and only Catholic prayers were effective, that would in fact be evidence for the supernatural. What I find interesting about this line of thinking is that, even if you expect that there should be a natural explanation, if the person claiming supernatural agency continues to make specific predictions that turn out true - predictions that, at least on the face, seem to be unexpected from our current understanding - then you'd have to start thinking that they are on to something. What I think is going on here is something a bit different than a God-of-the-gaps, at least in some contexts. One way of thinking about it is with an analogy to Dark Matter . In astronomy it was observed that galaxies rotated more rapidly than expected. Using the light emitted from the galaxy, you can estimate the amount of material needed to emit that light, and use that to determine rotation speeds. The amount of mass estimated from the light emitted is far less than the amount of mass estimated from the rotation speeds - somehow there is a large amount of mass unaccounted for. Astronomers named this extra mass \" Dark Matter \". Notice, that this is not an explanation for the extra mass, but a label for \"something I don't know is causing this effect\". One then has to make propositions of specific causes, like neutrinos, black holes, or even modifications of the laws of physics. From there one makes specific predictions, constructs methods for testing the propositions, and explores alternatives. The term, \" Dark Matter \", is still used as the umbrella term to label all of these alternatives. In this way, the term \"supernatural\" may be a label for \"something I don't know is causing this effect\", where the effect may be a miracle claim, prayers answered, origin of the universe, origin of life, etc... Thus, the phrase \"supernatural explanation\" is a meaningless phrase - there can be no supernatural explanation, just as Dark Matter is not an explanation. However, as Fishman uses in his title, one could test \"supernatural worldviews\" - those constructions that use the label to suggest some unknown (and possibly unknowable) agency at work. One might think that a scientific theory can't have anything like this in it, but that is not correct. For example, consider the wavefunction in quantum mechanics. Here we have an entity in a theory which is not directly observable - even in principle - yet the theory makes very specific predictions. It is possible to have such entities in a scientific theory, and we accept such entities in so far as the predictions which come from them are observed. There is a certain appeal to this way of thinking, and I feel that an honest assessment of religious claims could proceed in this way. However, I think more people use \"supernatural\" as an excuse, a truly God-of-the-gaps, and stop all inquiry into alternatives. They see it as an explanation, not a label, but fail to make the next proper step of following the predictions - everything is a post-diction. You say that the universe is finely tuned for life because of God? Ok, what suggestion can you make for the next cosmological experiment to perform? What experiment would you propose to distinguish your theory (with supernatural entities) from a theory of physical necessity (i.e. the constants must be that way) or statistical necessity (i.e. the multiverse)? You say that the supernatural is needed to understand prayers being answered? Sure, but how would you test that? How would you explain the (many) failed experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of prayer, and propose an alternative? These experiments should be easy to propose, if one is not just applying a God-of-the-gaps. Of course, we don't see these experiments proposed. So in summary, science cannot test supernatural explanations , because they are not defined. They can test specific predictions that incorporate unknown, and possibly unknowable, entities that have direct physical effects. In most cases of religious claims including supernatural effects there are no predictions made, and thus the term is empty and useless - an excuse for the intellectually lazy. Where specific predictions have been made (e.g. efficacy of prayer, existence of specific miracles, etc...) the predictions have not been supported. In this way, science can test God...and God has failed the test.","tags":"articles","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2015/Feb/04/testing-the-supernatural/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2015/Feb/04/testing-the-supernatural/"},{"title":"How to Deflate a Football Deflating Story","text":"So, it's all over the news, the Patriots cheated with deflating the football by 1-2 psi, and are lying about not knowing anything about it . There are even claims that there are scientific reasons for this being an advantage . What seems to be lacking at this point is: any actual evidence of wrongdoing - no video, no eyewitnesses, nothing any actual data concerning the footballs in question, i.e. their actual pressures at various times any actual data concerning all of the footballs in the game, i.e. their actual pressures at various times The only data we have is that the balls were measured later in the game, with an observed drop from the beginning of the game, and a possible way to benefit from that. The first thing we have to ask is, are there any mundane explanations of this observation? The second thing we have to ask is if there is a way to distinguish between the mundane explanations and the possible nefarious ones. Let's tackle the first. Can Temperature Change Account for the Data? Yes! When measuring the pressure in a football, we measure the difference between the pressure inside of the football and the atmospheric pressure. Atmospheric pressure is about 14.7 psi, so when the reading of the football pressure is, say, 13 psi then the absolute pressure is \\begin{equation} 14.7 \\,{\\rm psi} + 13 \\,{\\rm psi} = 27.7 \\,{\\rm psi} \\end{equation} From the ideal gas law we also have the relationship between pressure and temperature, \\begin{eqnarray} PV&=&nkT \\\\\\\\ P&\\propto& T \\\\\\\\ \\frac{P_1}{P_2}&=&\\frac{T_1}{T_2} \\end{eqnarray} So a change of temperature from 70 F (294 K) down to 40 F (278 K) leads to a drop in football pressure from 27.7 psi down to \\begin{eqnarray} \\frac{27.7\\,{\\rm psi}}{P_2}&=&\\frac{294 K}{278 K}\\\\\\\\ P_2&=& 26.2 \\,{\\rm psi} \\end{eqnarray} or a football pressure reading of \\begin{equation} 26.2 \\,{\\rm psi}- 14.7 \\,{\\rm psi} = 11.5 \\,{\\rm psi} \\end{equation} Perfectly within the range of data that we have access to. If the amount were much more (4 psi, for example) then we might get suspicious, but this does not seem to be the case. Well, that's nice in theory, but... Sure, it seems to work in theory, but we should test it. Well, someone has . He inflated two balls to 13 psi, one in the room and one in the refrigerator. It went down to 11.7 psi. He added that someone falling on the ball could also make the ball lose air. Nice and tidy. Hearing this, my mind was instantly made up - unless someone can provide actual evidence to the contrary. Was the interviewer convinced? Nope - \"Ok, disclaimer time. Yes, the professor is a Patriots fan, and these sound like a lot of excuses to let the Patriots off the hook. But he says that this is real scientific stuff.\" Yes, it is - and it's not rocket science either. It's not \"excuses\" , it's the most plausible explanation until someone can actually provide evidence contrary to it. What do we do with mundane explanations? Now that we have a mundane explanation, what do we do? We need to require of any other explanation a much more rigourous and strong case - the evidence has to be much stronger than otherwise, because the mundane explanation has a very high prior probability. Do we have that evidence? Not that I've seen. So, until someone shows me the video of a person letting out air from the football, or provides a credible witness, I'm chalking this one up to the typical hysteria Americans like in their news stories and go on with more important things. Let's hope the NFL listens to the science, and does the same.","tags":"articles","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2015/Jan/23/how-to-deflate-a-football-deflating-story/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2015/Jan/23/how-to-deflate-a-football-deflating-story/"},{"title":"Demo vs Experiment","text":"I was a judge for a local science fair this past week, and found a number of projects lacking. After thinking about it for a while, I realized that one of the problems seems to be the distinction (or, rather, lack of distinction) made between demos and experiments . In teaching science, especially in the younger grades, it seems common to say something like \"today we are going to do an experiment, mixing baking soda and vinegar\" . This, to me, is not an experiment . So, what do I think is the difference? Here are a few thoughts. Are there any more? The outcome of an experiment is unknown , whereas the outcome of a demo is known - deliberately. In an experiments, the variables are quantifiable , whereas the variables of a demo are typically discrete and not quantitfiable. In an experiment, the outcomes are also quantifiable . To continue with the example, the following demos would be bad science fair topics: what happens when we mix baking soda and vinegar? which produces more gas, baking soda and vinegar or baking power and vinegar? To make them true experiments, we could ask how does the amount of gas produced with baking soda and vinegar depend on the quantity of baking soda? (both the amount of baking soda and the amount of gas are quantifiable) to follow up, how does the amount of gas produced with baking powder and vinegar depend on the quantity of baking powder ?

This is a feeling I've had from time to time, and I've heard it leveled against skeptics from the proponents of these new methods. I think, however, given the (lack of) performance of the bulk of these claims, ones prior probability - quite rationally - should be low for the next one. It's not a bias to recognize that, all things being equal, the next silver bullet health claim is likely to be false. It should, however, be very easy for a health treatment that actually works to redeem itself above this prior probability. The criticism of \"bias\" is raised only when the treatment hasn't actually been demonstrated. The term bias is tricky depending on its usage. In many ways, bias is perfectly rational, if it means assuming something is false before the evidence. Does one say that a jury is biased against the guilt of the suspect? I think this sentence points to the fact that the word \"bias\" is typically used in a pejorative fashion, synonymous with being resistant to evidence. Even here, resistant to evidence is rational to the extent that stronger evidence is needed to raise a lower prior probability. Perhaps \"bias\" should mean willing to ignore some of the evidence against ones present view, in order to maintain this view. This can come innocently in the form of confirmation bias , and not be a deliberate distortion. Clearly this violates the axioms of probability , and should be avoided. Proper scientific thinking and process is constructed specifically to avoid this sort of bias, while at the same time supporting the rational forms of bias.","tags":"articles","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2015/Jan/05/we-should-all-be-biased/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2015/Jan/05/we-should-all-be-biased/"},{"title":"LaTeX vs Word","text":"Reading this review of a PloS One comparison between MS Word and LaTeX , I was struck by how much it resonates. There are many things that I do in both (or, more precisely, in Pages rather than Word) depending on the application. There are things that LaTeX can do much better than any other solution I have found, none of which is touched in the PloS One comparison . For me, some things that could not be done in Word or Pages without a ton of work, are mentioned in the review : Set up 50 numbered equations, refer to them throughout the text, then change the equation order. Have figures and their captions float to appropriate locations at the top or bottom of pages. Change the order of figures in a document and fix all references to those figures. The referencing (figures, equations, and bibliography) is one of the strong points of LaTeX . I see how much time my students spend on this in Word, and it completely erases the time-savings of Word. I would add the following as well: Programatically change the content of the document - for example, I've had flags to change mathematical notation, and flags for the student vs teacher versions of a document Easily generate LaTeX formatting from a script - I've written Python scripts to make tedious, large tables, and write them in LaTeX to be included in my book . Organize multi-part documents, with references, into multiple files Separate my thinking into separate content and layout modes I'm the first to admit that the learning curve of LaTeX is pretty steep, but once you know it, it really offers advantages for complex documents. For simple ones, it doesn't stack up to an easier program, but isn't that the case with most powerful tools? At that point, as the review also suggests, it makes more sense to write things in Markdown - which this blog is written in. So MS Word lands in that area of too-complex for simple documents and too-simple for complex documents.","tags":"articles","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Dec/31/latex-vs-word/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Dec/31/latex-vs-word/"},{"title":"The Longest Night Ever","text":"I recently saw a claim that this past December 21 was the longest solstice night ever...in the history of the planet! When I first heard this, and when I have told others, the first reaction is puzzlement - \"why is this particular Solstice special?\", \"how could it be that in the 4.5 billion years of the planet I would be here for this unique event?\" Of course, although unique, this is not an unusual event - the Earth is slowing down its spin, due to the interaction with the Moon. Thus, each year, every day is just a smidgen longer - about 20 millionths of a second each year. So next year's Solstice will be the longest in the history of the planet as well, as was every Solstice in the past (at the time). What I find interesting is the habit of people to infer specialness so quickly when faced with a puzzle. It is also interesting that once one understands the process, that specialness is immediately eliminated, and replaced with a more cosmic picture. There is a direct parallel with all times in our history when we have (falsely) inferred the specialness of people - the heliocentric Universe, the distinction between humans and animals, Earthly vs Celestial material, organic vs inorganic life, etc... This should serve as a reminder to us all to be skeptical of claims of specialness before understanding.

It was encouraging to me lately that there are two articles about Python, reiterating many of my experiences, and teaching me some things I was unaware of. The first, about myths about Python and its use in large-scale applications, was a real eye-opener. I've never had to scale my apps up, or have high security, so I had implicitly bought into the two myths that Python was not suited for the job. Nice to know I was wrong! The other, about someone's programming journey away from C and Java to Python , mirrored my own experience somewhat. For me, it was coming off of Matlab, and finding that I could do all of what Matlab offered and much more. At one time, I rewrote Matlab, Perl, Sed, Awk, and Jed scripts all in Python - being able to think in one language as opposed to five was a huge boon to productivity. In my experience, Python is the easiest language for a beginner to learn, and it is one of the most powerful languages I've ever worked with.

There are a couple of things I want to make plain from the outset. Evolution is a terrible guide for morality. We don't derive our moral intuitions by looking at the process of evolution and using that to evaluate them. We, and our moral intuitions, are the product of the process of evolution. We can go beyond evolution in this, and in other, domains. I hope to make this clear as we go on. Let me explore an analogy which I think is helpful. Vision as an analogy to morality Evolution has shaped our eyes, and the cognitive facilities that allow us to use them to build internal models of the world. There is almost certainly an objective reality, although I cannot think of any experiment which could possibly confirm this. It is possible that every persons' \" reality \" is relative to them, but I don't find this either a useful or convincing perspective. Even assuming an objective reality, our eyes do not give us a perfect rendition of it. Perception is as much constructed from the brain as it is perceived. Just because we can't \"get outside\" our own perceptions, this does not imply that we can't know anything about objective reality. This also doesn't imply that our vision system doesn't give us a decent approximation to reality - it does give us a decent approximation, but like all approximations, there are limits. How do we get around those limits? How do we surpass the limitations imposed by the evolutionary process on our vision to confirm the properties of objective reality? The process of science! We use a process of verification by others, of repeatability, of open and honest discovery to distinguish what is true from what isn't. We quantify the observations, we structure experiments, we explore our biases and design processes to reduce our sensitivity to them. We recognize that evolution didn't care about perfect vision, only what was good enough. We recognize that evolution is limited in terms of the solutions it can reach - full of jury-rigged partial solutions - which lead to things like the blind spot, and the brain processing to fill the spot in. We recognize the situations where our vision is particularly limited - two dimensional environments, environments without clear objects for comparison, odd coincidences in object placement, etc... In those cases we do not trust our visual intuitions, and lean on the more objective measures of scenes. Drawing out the analogy Here's a cut-and-paste job. What do you think? Evolution has shaped our moral intuitions, and the cognitive facilities that allow us to use them to build moral models of the world. There is almost certainly an objective morality, although I cannot think of any experiment which could possibly confirm this. It is possible that every persons' \" morality \" is relative to them, but I don't find this either a useful or convincing perspective. Even assuming an objective morality, our intuitions do not give us a perfect rendition of it. Moral perception is as much constructed from the brain as it is perceived. Just because we can't \"get outside\" our own perceptions (which seemed to be the primary criticism in the original Dogma Debate Episode which started this whole thing), this does not imply that we can't know anything about objective morality. This also doesn't imply that our moral intuition doesn't give us a decent approximation to reality - it does give us a decent approximation, but like all approximations, there are limits. How do we get around those limits? How do we surpass the limitations imposed by the evolutionary process on our moral intuitions to confirm the properties of objective morality?

We recognize the situations where our moral intuition is particularly limited - large numbers of people, in-group/out-group distinctions, etc... In those cases we do not trust our moral intuitions, and lean on the more objective measures of well-being.","tags":"articles","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Dec/02/evolution-and-morality/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Dec/02/evolution-and-morality/"},{"title":"Objective Morality Defined","text":"I was asked the following question about my claim that objective moral values exist: When you say that you firmly believe in objective morality, do you mean objective relative to the human species, or in an absolute sense? And is your primary reason for this belief the difficulty we would otherwise have in holding people accountable? The quick answer is that it is not relative to the human species, and no it is not due to any difficulty holding people accountable otherwise. The longer answer requires a bit more, and I think it useful to try to write down my thoughts on it. Almost all of this idea is encapsulated in Sam Harris' view of the Moral Landscape, or Matt Dillahunty's view of Secular Morality. As far as I can see it, all questions of morality have to deal with the well-being of conscious life. John Figdor on the Dogma Debate episode which sparked this, seemed to contrast the notion of well-being with other metrics of morality such as Utilitarianism (i.e. the \"greatest good for the greatest number\"), Rawlsian \"Veil of Ignorance\", and Christian Fundamentalism. However, what he didn't seem to realize, is that each of these is a subset of well-being, and offer \"rules of thumb\" to trying to maximize it. Even the Christian fundamentalist sees questions of morality, ultimately, in terms of well-being - just not in this life. So I find it not a hard stretch to define morality in such terms. If someone has a better usage, please have them put it up, but I haven't seen anything that isn't already part of the larger notion of well-being. Further, every use of the term that I have ever seen matches the perspective of morality centered on the well-being of conscious life. Once you accept this, either as a given or at least for the sake of argument, then the objectivity of morality naturally comes from the truth that the facts about well-being must derive from the facts of the universe - there must be right and wrong answers to questions about what will maximize well-being, whether we are able to access it perfectly or not. I do not think that the math of well-being is easy, nor is it linear, but I think one can come to some decent approximations. Slavery (i.e. owning other people as property) can be shown, objectively, to decrease well-being on many fronts. It is then quite likely that this is a moral absolute, although I could imagine someone coming up in the future with a derivation that shows that slavery is in fact better for well-being - but I doubt it. In the sciences, all conclusions are tentative, and the conclusions about slavery may be much like the conclusion that the Earth goes around the Sun and not vice versa. Sure, it's tentative, but I can't imagine it ever being overturned, and it would be perverse to think otherwise. Some moral questions, however, may be more like what happens sometimes in medicine where one may find something commonly thought of as good for you to turn out not to be. This doesn't negate the fact that there are, objectively, things that are good for you and things that are bad for you. It just speaks to our ability to know such things well, poorly, or approximately. I think the real benefit, however, in thinking in these terms is that it structures the discussion. Any discussion about the moral rightness of a position such as pro-choice, anti-gay marriage, anti-war, etc... must be framed in terms of well-being. When it isn't then it is divorced from the real consequences of those positions, and can lead to real harm. The problem with the religious discourse on these issues is not necessarily that they are wrong, but it is that their positions are disconnected from the real consequences of those positions. Or, perhaps, they are framed in terms of well-being but they make use of well-being in an afterlife, which they fail to be able to demonstrate actually exists - amounting to the same problem. Secular progress in moral domains occurs when there is a reasoned discussion, always focusing on the well-being of conscious life.","tags":"articles","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Nov/25/objective-morality-defined/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Nov/25/objective-morality-defined/"},{"title":"Objective Morality","text":"In a recent Dogma Debate Episode , we have a debate between the position of objective morality as espoused by Matt Dillahunty and subjective morality as espoused by John Figdor. I firmly believe in objective morality, and thought Matt did an ok job, but I disliked the directions the conversation took most of the time. The biggest problem I saw with John's argument was that he said that there is a fundamental difference between social sciences and physical sciences, and that knowledge in latter can be considered \"objective\". He then argued that questions of morality are more like the former, and can only be discussed subjectively. He argued that we can't get outside of our biases and opinions to be objective about questions of morality, and thus it is the result of opinion. He contrasted it to the objective engineering reality that a spring has a finite, measurable, and specific breaking point - which can be written in pounds or some other force. The issue is a matter of complexity. There is no fundamental difference between sociology, economics, and physics. Different methods are needed because the level of complexity, levels of uncertainty, and the limits of our techniques dictate this. Although moral questions are complex, and challenging, that morality has to do with the well-being of conscious creatures is true by definition. As such, all such questions connect to the real world, and have real-world consequences, and we can have knowledge of these moral facts as we have knowledge in any domain of rationality. Even something as direct as the breaking point of a spring has more complexity than John is willing to admit. It is not a single number, but depends on temperature, the history of the spring, and other things. These are things that one can possibly quantify, but there are complexities still not entirely understood. Moral questions may suffer from the same uncertainties as even the least quantitative social sciences, it doesn't change the fact that there are objective moral facts in principle. The problem with John's position, as I see it, is that he can never possibly say another moral viewpoint is wrong - even the most horrendous acts. These other viewpoints are just unfashionable. Such thinking is dangerous, I believe, and leads to a kind of moral paralysis.","tags":"articles","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Nov/21/objective-morality/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Nov/21/objective-morality/"},{"title":"Statistical Inference for Everyone (sie)","text":"This is a new approach to an introductory statistical inference textbook, motivated by probability theory as logic.

Essentially, philosophers want to say that \"nothing\" is without properties or process, and that Krauss' physics-based \"nothing\" has properties. Thus the apologists claim that the universe cannot come from \"nothing\", that there must be a creator. I was thinking about this today. One response is that no one has demonstrated that the philosophical notion of \"nothing\" is at all possible - there may not be a way for there to be \"nothing\". One also hasn't demonstrated that the universe itself couldn't have always existed, or perhaps the laws have always existed. But even granting all of that, the creation of the universe from \"nothing\" by the creator is not even a creation from \"nothing\" - the creator has to be there first, and the creator has properties, and is presumed to be eternal. Thus the philosophers and apologists who claim that the creator made the universe \"ex nihilo\" are really claiming nothing of the sort.","tags":"articles","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Oct/28/something-from-nothing/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Oct/28/something-from-nothing/"},{"title":"What is AI?","text":"In his blog post, Chatbots are boring. They aren't AI. , PZ Myers the professor of biology at the University of Minnesota Morris has this to say about chatbots and AI: Chatbots are kind of the lowest of the low, the over-hyped fruit decaying at the base of the tree. They aren't even particularly interesting. What you've got is basically a program that tries to parse spoken language, and then picks lines from a script that sort of correspond to whatever the interlocutor is talking about. There is no inner dialog in the machine, no ‘thinking', just regurgitations of scripted output in response to the provocation of language input. He then goes on to say what should work: Programming in associations is not how consciousness is going to arise. What you need to work on is a general mechanism for making associations and rules. The model has to be something like a baby. Have you noticed that babies do not immediately start parroting their parents' speech and reciting grammatically correct sentences? They flail about, they're surprised when they bump some object and it moves, they notice that suckling makes their tummy full, and they begin to construct mental models about how the world works. I'll be impressed when an AI is given no pre-programmed knowledge of language at all, and begins with baby-talk babbling and progresses over months or years to construct its own competence in comprehending speech. He may be justified in complaining about overzealous claims from some researchers, but he is dead wrong about what AI is, what it takes to be considered AI, and his criterion for accepting an intelligent machine. He's even wrong about the biology, which is somewhat surprising given his field. Let's have a look at this more closely. What is AI? In general, the field of AI, can be summarized as the production of machines that do things that typically only humans have done in the past. It says nothing about the way that those machine solve those problems. The chess-playing tour-de-force, Deep Blue , defeated the best human at chess - a game that at one time was a symbol of human intellect - not by playing like the grandmaster, but by being a really fast, stupid machine. It examined trillions of ridiculous options that the grandmaster never even considered, to cull from those trillions the one or two good moves. Was there any \"inner dialog in the machine\" or \"thinking\"? Not at all. Was it AI? Of course it was. It was a machine solving a problem that was, before that point, limited to humans. What is Intelligence? Perhaps PZ Myers is complaining that these machine aren't intelligent, like humans are, and I'd agree that we are a long way from the sorts of machines that rival humans in some domains. However, I am not sure that when he uses the term intelligence that he is considering a well-defined quantity. Like Searle's Chinese Room , how do we know that there is a 'dialog in the machine' even inside of a human? How do we know that we are not simply picking \"lines from a script\", albeit a fairly complex script? I'm not sure we do, so the critique to me seems a bit vacuous. Pre-programmed? I'll be impressed when an AI is given no pre-programmed knowledge of language at all, and begins with baby-talk babbling and progresses over months or years to construct its own competence in comprehending speech This line baffled me - does PZ Myers believe that a human baby has no pre-programming for language? That the baby is a complete blank slate? Evolution has clearly pre-programmed us for abilities in general language acquisition, so even babies are not a blank slate. His challenge then, for AI, would rule out humans as well! Finally, much of the recent Deep Learning research is essentially what PZ is wishing for (although not in the domain of language, that I have read). Here, artificial networks start with random starting conditions and learn patterns from the data, to achieve sophisticated inference in complex domains. It may be premature to claim that we are on the verge of creating artificial consciousness, but the naive responses such as those exemplified by PZ Myers here do not reflect the reality of AI research. Ironically, it smacks of the same tone creationists take to try to keep humans special at all costs, a tone that I am sure PZ Myers would not appreciate being attributed to him.","tags":"articles","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Oct/14/what-is-ai/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Oct/14/what-is-ai/"},{"title":"Naturalism of the Gaps?","text":"I heard a term yesterday that I hadn't every heard before, while listening to a very interesting interview/debate with Mike Licona on the Resurrection . The term is \"naturalism of the gaps\", as a parallel (and supposedly equally flawed) argument to the \"god of the gaps\". In a nutshell, it refers to those people who claim that someday there will be a natural explanation for a particular problem currently not understood (e.g. consciousness, origin of life, origin of the universe, etc...) As one apologetic website puts it , Yet it is important to notice how entrenched naturalists are to their mindset and worldview. When it comes to science, only physical and material explanations are allowable (called methodological naturalism)–the supernatural is ruled out a priori (without examination). Also, some naturalists express excessive confidence that the future will explain reality. But they don't live in the future and it is illegitimate to appeal to the expected explanations of the future to explain present reality (what is needed is evidence in the present). This faulty form of reasoning constitutes the argumentum ad futuris fallacy (\"accept this because future evidence will support it\"). Ironically it might even be called \"naturalism-of-the-gaps\" reasoning. There are two very straightforward responses to this kind of reasoning. Methodological naturalism is the only choice we have available, because no one has demonstrated any procedure to distinguish supernatural claims. Thus, if we are in the business of distinguishing claims, we are left as a matter of practicality with the only option that does not address supernaturalism at all. To assume a naturalistic explanation in the future is simply the recognition that in every single case where we have finally understood a topic, the best explanation has never turned out to be supernatural... ever . There are literally millions of cases going the other direction, where a supernatural agent was used to explain something and a natural explanation supplanted the supernatural explanation. This happened with lightning, seasons, the sun moving in the sky, the planets moving in the sky, earthquakes, disease, etc.... To bet on naturalism is simply to recognize this historical pattern, and to put your money down on the only horse that has ever won in this race against the horse that has always lost in this race.

At one point he brings up evidence for the sun coming up, as an example of knowledge claims and models. Calum describes Hume Calum - \"Hume basically noted that we don't have any non-circular justification for thinking that the universe will be regular, that it will continue to be regular in the future. [...] He doesn't just say that we have to be a bit unsure that the sun will rise tomorrow, he says that we have no good reason at all for thinking the sun will rise tomorrow. The most common justification that the sun will rise tomorrow is that it has risen every day in the past. But then if you compare two theories, one says that the sun rises everyday in the past and in the future and the other theory says that the sun rises everyday in the past but won't rise tomorrow. Both those theories predict the observations we already have, both those theories lead us to expect the observations, and so the observations we currently have don't distinguish between these two theories. And yet one of those theories predicts the sun will rise tomorrow and one of them predicts that the sun won't rise tomorrow. So, even though we have those observations, they don't really do an obviously good job of determining which of these theories is true. [...] He is saying that the past observations don't give us that good reason for thinking that the sun will rise tomorrow. This is the Problem of Induction and has perplexed philosophers for centuries.\"{.tq} What does Hume actually say about the Sun rising? Hume writes : Matters of fact, which are the second objects of human reason, are not ascertained in the same manner; nor is our evidence of their truth, however great, of a like nature with the foregoing. The contrary of every matter of fact is still possible, because it can never imply a contradiction, and is conceived by the mind with the same facility and distinctness, as if ever so conformable to reality. That the sun will not rise tomorrow is no less intelligible a proposition, and implies no more contradiction, than the affirmation, that it will rise. We should in vain, therefore, attempt to demonstrate its falsehood. Were it demonstratively false, it would imply a contradiction, and could never be distinctly conceived by the mind. An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding (1772). Hackett Publ Co. 1993; Chapter on Cause and Effect. Here Hume is essentially stating that all propositions have a non-zero probability (however small they might be) unless they are logically impossible. This is not saying, at all, that we have no good reason to believe the sun will rise tomorrow. The bread, which I formerly ate, nourished me: that is, a body of such sensible qualities was, at that time, endued with such secret powers; but does it follow, that other bread must also nourish me at another time, and that like sensible qualities must always be attended with like secret powers? The consequence seems nowise necessary. Again, although Hume predates probability theory, this is essentially what he is saying - the consequence is not logically necessary (i.e. \\(P({\\rm consequence}|{\\rm observations})<1\\) ). We see this as a direct application of probability theory, a totally uncontroversial application at that. I fail to see that the \"problem\" of induction is really a problem. I also fail to see Hume claiming that there is no good reason to see the consequence following from the the observations, just that he doesn't see one: The connection between these propositions is not intuitive. There is required a medium, which may enable the mind to draw such an inference, if indeed it be drawn by reasoning and argument. What that medium is, I must confess, passes my comprehension, and it is incumbent on those to produce it, who assert that it really exists, and is the origin of all our conclusions concerning matter of fact. The medium Hume refers to is simply the calculus of probability, something which post-dates Hume's writings. Hume was being honest that he didn't see a way, and he did not claim that there was no possible way - that would be an argument from ignorance. What does Laplace say about the Sun rising? Once we have probability theory, then we can actually do some simple calculations concerning the probability of the sun rising tomorrow. Of course these calculations are not a complete description of the problem, but give the flavor of it. Laplace used the sunrise problem as an example application of his Rule of Succession, which itself is derived from the rules of probability. The calculation goes something like this. Our model is that the sun rises with unknown probability \\(p\\) Given complete ignorance of \\(p\\) we assume an initial uniform probability The sun has risen every day for the written record, say, 10000 years the probability for rising tomorrow, which is also the mean value of \\(p\\) over the posterior, is given by the Rule of Succession (also known as the \"assume one success and one failure\"): \\begin{eqnarray} P(r_{\\rm tomorrow}|r_{\\rm today}, r_{\\rm yesterday}, r_{\\rm day before}, \\ldots, r_{0}) &=& \\frac{10000 {\\rm yr}\\times 365 {\\rm d}/{\\rm yr}+1}{10000 {\\rm yr}\\times 365 {\\rm d}/{\\rm yr}+2}\\\\\\\\ &=&0.9999997 \\end{eqnarray} It gets messier when you can't even assume that both a failure and a success are possible, but it can still be done without any change to the qualitative result. Clearly we have quite good reasons to believe the that sun will rise tomorrow. Two theories We go back to Calum's two theories: If you compare two theories, one says that the sun rises everyday in the past and in the future and the other theory says that the sun rises everyday in the past but won't rise tomorrow. Both those theories predict the observations we already have, both those theories lead us to expect the observations, and so the observations we currently have don't distinguish between these two theories.{.tq} The situation for arguing a high probability of tomorrow's sun rise is far more compelling, however, because our information is not simply that the sun has risen in the past, but includes observations of the patterns of the seasons, the predictions of the phases of the moon and Venus, and a whole host of other factors which significantly increase the chance the sun will rise. Laplace knew this well, and was using this example not as a serious calculation, but as a pedagogical example. As a consequence, both of Calum's so-called theories do not predict the observations we already have - only one of them does. Even if we accept just the observations for which both theories are consistent in the past, one has to view this two-theory perspective from the point of prediction. It's now tomorrow, and \"Theory B\" doesn't work - so we modify it to say the sun won't rise tomorrow (the new tomorrow). That next day comes with a sunrise, and this \"Theory B 2.0\" is wrong (again) and has to be modified (again). It is clear that \"Theory B\" fails, and we should be less confident in it. That's why, in science, it isn't nearly enough to be consistent with past data - one must make predictions, not just post-dictions, and test it. It is often trivial to come up with \"explanations\" for data we already have. Conclusions It seems to me that the so-called \"Problem of Induction\" was solved centuries ago, with the advent of probability theory, and all such hand-wringing seems to be only for philosophers. In the sciences, these challenges to induction just aren't taken seriously. I'll sleep soundly tonight with the confident knowledge that the sun will rise again tomorrow, despite the protestations of philosophers.","tags":"Unbelievable Project","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Sep/22/will-the-sun-rise-tomorrow/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Sep/22/will-the-sun-rise-tomorrow/"},{"title":"Theism vs Atheism","text":"On a recent Unbelievable podcast there is a discussion between Calum Miller and James Croft on the topic \"is our universe more likely on atheism or theism?\", where Calum introduces probabilistic arguments throughout. Although James does a good job of pressing Calum's arguments in weak points, and framing the argument in a more coherent way, I think there is much more to be said about the weaknesses of this particular argument, and the framing of these problems in terms of probability. There is a danger in this sort of thing of using mathemtics to give the veneer of authenticity to an argument that is riddled with random guesses, ill-defined concepts, and unsupported premises. Let's start with some quotes from the episode, so we can see where this is going. The Argument Calum - \"I think one useful way of thinking about is is to consider what evidence is in general. When we think about evidence for a theory, in this case the theory is that God exists - we want to explain some features of the world, we look for things (observations) which are surprising if the theory isn't true but which aren't that surprising if the theory is true.\"{.tq} Calum then goes on to do an analogy with fingerprints on a murder weapon. And then points out the observation that he believes is evidence for God. {.theist} Calum - \"There are a number of arguments that work this way. But one of the partiular pieces of evidence that I want to discuss today is that the world exhibits a real kind of regularity and there are basic laws, science works, that we can understand the world. For all we know, the universe could have been chaotic, might not have been any laws at all, we might not have been able to do science - it might have been complete chaos. \"{.tq} Here he's describing the form of the argument, as it might apply to the sun rising.{.theist} Calum - \"Even more basic things that we use scientific reasoning for, but do not always strike us as scientific truth. For example, 'the sun will rise tomorrow' . Most of us believe that. This is a common-sense inference from our observations. On atheism to expect that regularity, for the sun could just fail to rise tomorrow, but on theism we can expect that kind of regularity because God set it in place. [...] That's just one example, and you'd need a lot more for the full argument.\"{.tq} He finishes by describing how moral responsibility hinges on this regularity, because I need to know the likely effect of my actions on others in order to make moral decisions and be responsible for them. If things were chaotic, if my actions had random effects, then moral responsibility could not work.{.theist} The problem with the math - posteriors vs likelihoods The first problem that struck me was that, from a math point of view, he is simply doing a likelihood ratio: \\begin{eqnarray} \\frac{P({\\rm data}|{\\rm theism})}{P({\\rm data}|{\\rm atheism})} \\end{eqnarray} and saying that this is greater than one, and thus theism is more likely. That is just the wrong question to ask. What we really want to look at, even keeping the same structure, is the ratio of the posterior probabilities, or \\begin{eqnarray} \\frac{P({\\rm theism}|{\\rm data})}{P({\\rm atheism}|{\\rm data})} \\end{eqnarray} which is related to the likelihood ratio through Bayes' theorem: \\begin{eqnarray} \\frac{P({\\rm theism}|{\\rm data})}{P({\\rm atheism}|{\\rm data})} &=& \\frac{P({\\rm data}|{\\rm theism})}{P({\\rm data}|{\\rm atheism})} \\times \\frac{P({\\rm theism})}{P({\\rm atheism})} \\end{eqnarray} where we factor in the prior probabilities. Already, we have an issue, because the prior probability for the universe with an extra agent should be smaller than one without such an agent. If you factor in the an agent with many specific properties, then this is smaller still. By omitting this part, you could argue for anything. For example, \\begin{eqnarray} \\frac{P({\\rm data}|{\\rm fairies})}{P({\\rm data}|{\\rm no-fairies})}>1 \\end{eqnarray} or the regularity of the universe is much more likely given fairies than no-fairies, so that is evidence for the fairies. Even if true, it is clearly an uninteresting and unuseful claim. The problem with the premise regarding theism The next problem that struck me was that it seemed that Calum was trying to sneak in many more details into his theism than his argument would warrant. He needs to define what he means by theism to state that it is more likely to result in a regular universe. For example, a number of counter examples can be made: Under the Greek pantheon, it is more likely that things would be chaotic, at the will of capricious deities Gods or divine beings, such as Cthulhu, revel in chaos and thus would make it less likely to result in a regular universe So when Calum says \"theism\", what he seems to mean is the existence of \"order-making Gods\", but then his argument is circular: a regular universe is more likely under a regular-universe-making God hypothesis than not. The problem with the premise regarding atheism Further, Calum never supports (and James reiterates this many times) that it is unlikely to have an ordered universe under atheism. \"For all we know, the universe could be chaotic\", Calum says. However, that needs to be demonstrated , not asserted, or it is an argument from ignorance in disguise. It is possible, and in fact cosmology seems to be pointing more in this direction, that the universe could not be any other way - that the regularity is the result of the production of any universe, and further that the production of universes is the only stable solution. The notion of philosophical \"nothing\" may be physically unstable and thus unlikely to ever exist. Concluding thoughts I find Calum's introduction of morality to the argument adds nothing, and only serves as a red herring. Without some regularity in the universe, even thought itself would be impossible . We couldn't even have the idea of a \"being\", or an animal, or life without regularity. Thus, our mere existence requires regularity - but one that need not be imposed from the outside, with a God. Introducing the notion of a generic theism causes more problems to the argument than it solves, because it includes Zeus and Cthulhu. Circularity results when restricting the relevant theism to exclude these possibilities. Even if Calum solved this, the basic set-up of the problem is answering the wrong question, and is at best an uninteresting and useless result. There is more to this episode, which I'll address later, but these objections are enough to derail the entire argument Calum makes.","tags":"Unbelievable Project","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Sep/18/theism-vs-atheism/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Sep/18/theism-vs-atheism/"},{"title":"What's the Harm in Alternative Medicine?","text":"When challenging the bogus medical claims of herbalists, chiropractors, and homeopaths one is often countered with the question \"what's the harm?\" How could harm come from a treatment that, even if false, doesn't do anything? Well, we have an example in the recent news of the ebola outbreak. We hear that the outbreak in Sierra Leone, with the death toll in the hundreds now, was started by an herbalist claiming cures of ebola that were unfounded. No more can one honestly claim that no harm is done by alternative medicine. It's just too bad it takes such a tragedy for some to come to this realization.

This leads inexorably to the processes of science. Lawrence Krauss flippantly said that if the stars in the sky reorganize and spelled out the words of the Bible it would get him to start considering it (however, upon reflection, one might want to consider delusion at that point). Believers talk about, if the bones of Jesus were found that would do it...however, is that even reasonable to expect under any circumstances? It's a lot simpler than that, than trying to find nearly impossible data. If we insert any kind of scientific claim, like \"what evidence would convince me of [the Sun orbiting the Earth], [evolution], [evolution is false], etc...\", we can start to see part of the problem. It's not a matter of new evidence, it is a matter of explaining the existing evidence...and then some. In order to convince me that evolution by natural selection is false, you have to come up with an explanation that does as well explaining all the existing data (e.g. geographic organization of animals, embryology, genetic relationships, vestigial features, etc...) as well as find a domain which cannot be explained by evolution by natural selection. Apologists often focus on the latter, pointing out supposed flaws or gaps in our understanding, but that is not nearly enough. The gaps are either things we already understand with this theory (e.g. intermediate forms), or are not addressed by this theory (e.g. origin of life), or are details that don't change the overall picture (e.g. punctuated equilibrium). Even if true gaps were found, to mount an actual overthrow of evolution by natural selection, you have to put forward a useful explanation that works for all of the cases natural selection works for. Here we can think of Newton's laws. What evidence would it take for me not to believe in Newton's Law of Gravity? Pretty much nothing at this point, even though I know there is a correction with Einstein's equations - Newton's laws work so well, that it is very nearly the truth even given its limitations. All of the evidence for Newton's Law of Gravity is still around, and isn't changing, and any replacement has to address that (which Einstein's equations do). This is why science gets progressively harder. Now, with the evidence for God, any explanation has to deal with the fact that the various direct predictions from, say, Christianity have been systematically undermined by science. Mental disease caused by spirits? World created in the order (orders?) specified in Genesis? End of the world coming before 100AD? Prayer is a direct, and effective, method for healing? People are actually spoken to by spirits/God? God designed the diversity of life on the planet? There was a global flood in the past 10,000 years? These are topics, directly supported in the Bible, and refuted by science. The only way modern Christians deal with them is to either say the science is wrong (which it isn't) or to ignore those inconvenient parts of the Bible as \"metaphor\". Like the evidence for a flat Earth, or the heliocentric solar system, the evidence for Christianity is a tale of an ever increasing list of refuted claims, until all we are left with are claims about the fringes of our understanding and a possible deist agent out there...somewhere. Any theist explanation must first to be able to contend with this mountain of negative evidence before it can get off the ground. What would convince me of the truth of Christianity? I don't need the stars reorganized, or a big booming voice from the sky. If any of the direct claims of Christianity were to be demonstrated as true, then I'd be willing to begin to consider it.","tags":"articles","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Aug/15/what-evidence-would-it-take/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Aug/15/what-evidence-would-it-take/"},{"title":"What Sane Climate Discussion Looks Like","text":"One of the standard climate blogs I read is Judith Curry's blog Climate Etc... I find that the topics she brings up, and the points she adds to it, are always very engaging and even-handed, without the usual alarmism. For example, here is a summary of Bjorn Lomborg's Senate testimony , all points perfectly reasonable, as far as I can see. From his estimates, \"The cost of inaction by the end of the century is equivalent to an annual loss of GDP growth on the order of 0.02%....equivalent to losing one year's growth, or a moderate, one year recession.\" while \"policy action as opposed to inaction, also has costs, and will still incur a significant part of the climate damage.\" and incur (optimistically) a cost of \"1.5% of GDP by the end of the century.\" Further, he addresses certain specific policies, like Solar and wind power was subsidized by \\ \\(60 billion in 2012, despite their paltry climate benefit of \\\\) 1.4 billion. Essentially, $58.6 billion were wasted. Depending on political viewpoint, that money could have been used to get better health care, more teachers, better roads, or lower taxes. Moreover, forcing everyone to buy more expensive, less reliable energy pushes higher costs throughout the economy, leaving less for welfare. I find, nearly universally, that people who espouse strong environmental policies never look at the benefits of not doing those policies - they focus entirely on one side of the economics. Finally, I like the metaphor that he brought in The metaphor here is the computer in the 1950s. We did not obtain better computers by mass producing them to get cheaper vacuum tubes. We did not provide heavy subsidies so that every Westerner could have one in their home in 1960. Nor did we tax alternatives like typewriters. The breakthroughs were achieved by a dramatic ramping up of R&D, leading to multiple innovations, which enabled companies like IBM and Apple to eventually produce computers that consumers wanted to buy. This seems to me to be a rational way to discuss these topics.","tags":"articles","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Aug/05/what-sane-climate-discussion-looks-like/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Aug/05/what-sane-climate-discussion-looks-like/"},{"title":"What is Science?","text":"Today I gave a presentation on the general topic of \"What is Science?\" After some brief remarks about what science isn't and some of the factors (such as attitude) which reflects the best of science, I had the audience of around 16 students perform tests on automatic flushing toilets.

I have my initial response here , but want to look at another aspect of it in the current post. Peter defines faith either as \"pretending to know things you do not know\" or \"belief without evidence.\" From the OED we have faith defined as \"complete trust or confidence in someone or something\". Tim says that very few Christians (less than 1%) would use Peter's definition, with the vast majority using something similar to the OED. Peter claims that it is just the reverse. Which is it? Research via Google In an informal way, one can do research via google to get an overall sense for how a term is used. I make no claims this is exhaustive, or even particularly scholarly, but I would wager that if a term is used in less than 1% of the population in a certain way it is unlikely to appear in the first few google results. I casually googled around, and found a few quotes. As you can easily verify, I found that the dominant definition does seem to be Tim's, but that the \"belief without [sufficient] evidence\" occurs more then 1% of the time, but not nearly 50%. In some of the cases, it is hard to determine which way (or both!) that they are understanding the term. Obviously a more systematic approach might be useful, but as with nearly all such empirical matters, the case is less black-and-white than proponents or opponents like to portray. The two terms I tried were \"faith in God\", which universally gives Tim's definition in the first page of hits, and \"you must have faith\", which uses Peter's definition in at least two of the 15 or so top hits. One of these ( http://www.strangenotions.com/do-atheists-have-faith/ ) says: I think that the concept of faith can be understood, in many cases, as involving belief without a certain kind or amount of evidence—the kind or amount that would give us certain proof. This is entirely equivalent to the \"faith = probability\" definition of Peter's, and the website author levels this against atheists saying that they have \"faith\". Another ( http://hopefaithprayer.com/you-cant-believe-until-you-have-faith/ ) says: Believing requires faith, and faith requires the action of believing. Which, when you apply to the parachute example makes no sense at all, unless you interpret faith as believing without suffient evidence. Using the word \"faith\" in an argument I think it is clear that people do use the term \"faith\" in both ways, but let's for the moment accept Tim's definition. \"Faith\" then should never be used in an argument in any way, especially with people who don't believe in God. Why is that? Because, any analysis of utility theory has essentially two components - the probability part, where one has to present evidence for the different possibilities, and the utility part, which places the value on different outcomes. The atheist hasn't even gotten through the first part, so the utility part is a non-sequitur. Since faith, under Tim's definition, requires the utility part to have any meaning, then to bring faith into the argument before, or along with, the evidence is simply not useful. Doing so is much more likely to be interpreted by the atheist as a substitute for evidence, and make people like Peter assume that faith is belief without evidence. Is \"faith\" a way of knowing? As for the question about whether faith is a way of knowing, the answer has to be a clear \"No.\" Even under Tim's definition, faith is not a way of knowing, but a label we give to the act of weighing the probability and the utility of unlikely (a-priori) possibilities, actions, and outcomes. So let's ditch the word faith, which is a loaded term anyway, and use the word \"trust\" when we mean \"trust\" and \"evidence\" when we mean \"evidence\".","tags":"Unbelievable Project","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Jul/28/is-faith-the-same-as-trust-or-baseless-belief/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Jul/28/is-faith-the-same-as-trust-or-baseless-belief/"},{"title":"Faith, Trust, and Evidence","text":"I was listening to the Unbelievable podcast debate between Tim McGrew and Peter Boghossian on the definition of faith and whether or not faith is a valid way of knowing. In this discussion, Boghossian's main point - that \"faith is belief without evidence\" or \"pretending to know things you do not know\" - is derailed quite early and he never truly addresses the counter definition other than to claim that few people use it. The discussion then devolved into a back and forth with both sides claiming that \"all the people I know use my definition\", and got nowhere. Let's look at these definitions, and see where it goes. {.me} The Definitions Peter - \"Belief without evidence.\"{.aq} Peter - \"Pretending to know things you do not know.\"{.aq} OED - \"complete trust or confidence in someone or something\" Tim says that very few Christians (less than 1%) would use Peter's definition{.theist} I agree that no Christian would articulate this definition of faith, however they may be functionally using it, which we will address later. Peter really should have said that.{.me} Tim - \"Faith is trusting in, holding to, and acting on what one has good reason to believe is true in the face of difficulties. The difficulties may be where you have to take an action where the outcome is beyond your control.\"{.tq} The example Tim gives is jumping out of an airplane, where you have faith in your instructor that he packed your parachute properly. Your act of jumping makes faith more than simply hope (if you just hoped your instructor packed it, you wouldn't jump), and the decision is made in the face of evidence, not despite it or without it.{.me} When Peter asks Tim what people mean when they accuse someone of having \"faith in evolution\", Tim responds {.atheist} You're trusting in something that you cannot completely verify because it doesn't lie open to your senses. {.tq} When Peter asks Tim what people mean when they say \"I don't have enough faith to be an atheist\", Tim responds{.atheist} Belief in something in the face of certain difficulties, where the weight of the difficulties is greater on one side compared to the other.{.tq} When Peter asks Tim \"Why don't we say that we have faith in the existence of chickens?\", Tim responds{.atheist} We are venturing nothing on the existence of chickens. When I believe that chickens exist and I act on that belief I am not taking any step that places outcomes I care about beyond my direct control. [In the case of religion], people are placing the outcome of their eternal soul out of their control. They are taking a risk where the outcomes matter. The decision itself is evidenced but the outcome is uncertain.{.tq} When Peter asks Tim \"Do you have faith or evidence that Islam is false?\", Tim responds{.atheist} Why would I use the word \"faith\" when I am venturing nothing on Islam? I am a little bit confused about the framing of the question that way. I think I have evidence that it is false, but since I am not venturing on Islam, I'm not sure why the word faith would come in. {.tq} Addressing the Definitions I've said this before , but it bears repeating. The word faith conflates two related terms - probability and utility. Probability is just the value we assign to the strength of belief, and utility is the value we assign as the reward (or penalty) we receive when taking an action. They both have well-defined mathematical relationships and procedures (e.g. Bayes theorem, decision theory, etc...) A rational actor should try to maximize expected utility. From Wikipedia on Decision Theory ,{.me} The idea of expected value is that, when faced with a number of actions, each of which could give rise to more than one possible outcome with different probabilities, the rational procedure is to identify all possible outcomes, determine their values (positive or negative) and the probabilities that will result from each course of action, and multiply the two to give an expected value. The action to be chosen should be the one that gives rise to the highest total expected value.{.me} Clearly claims using expected utility require that probability assignments have already been made, so claims of utility must necessarily be probability claims as well. When translated into these more precise terms, both Tim's and Peter's claims begin to make more sense. It will also show that Tim is in fact using the definition, in some cases, like Peter and is therefore inconsistent.{.me} You have faith in your instructor that he packed your parachute properly. Your act of jumping makes faith more than simply hope (if you just hoped your instructor packed it, you wouldn't jump), and the decision is made in the face of evidence, not despite it or without it.{.tq} The equations are:{.me} \\(\\langle U(J) \\rangle = U_I \\times P(K_I) + U_B \\times P(K_B)\\) \\(\\langle U(N) \\rangle = V_I \\times P(K_I) + V_B \\times P(K_B)\\) with the notation{.me} \\(K_I\\) is the proposition \"my instructor packed my parachute\"{.me} \\(K_B\\) is the proposition \"Peter Boghossian packed my parachute\"{.me} \\(U(J)\\) is the utility gained from jumping{.me} \\(U(N)\\) is the utility gained from not jumping{.me} \\(U_I\\) ( \\(V_I\\) ) is the utility gained if you jump (don't jump) and the instructor packed the parachute{.me} \\(U_B\\) ( \\(V_B\\) ) is the utility gained if you jump (don't jump) and Peter Boghossian packed the parachute{.me} We have the following approximate values for the variables:{.me} \\(P(K_I)\\sim 1\\) (nearly certain the instructor packed the parachute){.me} \\(P(K_B)\\sim 0\\) (nearly certain that Peter didn't pack the parachute){.me} \\(U_I\\gg 1\\) (good benefit from jumping, with instructor packing the parachute){.me} \\(U_B\\ll 0\\) (very bad penalty for jumping, with Peter packing the parachute){.me} \\(V_B\\sim V_I \\sim 0\\) (neutral gain for not jumping in either case){.me} Notice, for Tim to have \"faith in his instructor\", two things must be true:{.me} \\(P(K_I)\\sim 1\\) (nearly certain the instructor packed the parachute){.me} \\(U_I\\gg 1\\) (good benefit from jumping, with instructor packing){.me} Tim wants to focus on point (2), while Peter wants to focus on point (1). Once seen this way, it is very easy to understand the responses. {.me} Why don't we say that we have faith in the existence of chickens?{.atheist} Because \\(U_{\\rm chickens}\\sim V_{\\rm chickens}\\sim W_{\\rm chickens}\\sim \\cdots\\sim 0\\) , for all choices with utilities \\(U, V, W, \\cdots\\) even if we are confident that chickens exist (i.e. \\(P({\\rm chickens})\\sim 1\\) ). {.me} Do you have faith or evidence that Islam is false?{.atheist} Tim has evidence that Islam is false, \\(P(I|{\\rm data})\\ll 1\\) , but is not venturing anything on Islam (or more accurately, on his choice to not follow Islam), \\(U_{\\rm not-Islam}\\sim 0\\) . Again, Peter sees the first part, yet ignores the second part. {.me} Not all is well with Tim Going back to this little exchange, we note that Tim is also using Peter's definition:{.me} When Peter asks Tim what people mean when they accuse someone of having \"faith in evolution\", Tim responds {.atheist} You're trusting in something that you cannot completely verify because it doesn't lie open to your senses. {.tq} Now I can think of no way to understand this statement from the perspective of Tim's definition:{.me} \"When I act on that belief I am taking some step that places outcomes I care about beyond my direct control\"{.tq} What outcomes are you placing beyond your control believing in evolution? What obvious utility are you weighing in this case? As far as I can see there is none, and so faith is in fact being used here as \"belief without sufficient evidence\". {.me} Priors and Faith I think this brings in another aspect of faith, which I believe applies to all of the cases explored so far, and that is that faith is used only in contexts with low prior probability. In this conversation, they spoke of faith in the context of the supernatural, extreme activities (i.e. jumping out of planes), events beyond our immediate senses - all of which coincide with lower prior probability, and need more evidence than is typical to overcome them. They may, or may not, also have high utility. We don't have faith in the existence of chickens because the existence of chickens has high prior probability. {.me} The Empirical Claim I'll have to address the empirical question Tim raises in another post. Is it empirically true, as Tim claims, that less than 1% of the people use the term faith in the way that Peter defines it (i.e., belief without [sufficient] evidence)? {.me} Even in Tim's case, however, I have found he doesn't use it all the time in the way he claims, and reverts to Peter's definition when convenient. That is the problem with the word - since it is referring to two distinct components, the apologist can easily switch between them without even noticing themselves. That's why I don't like using the word, and simply try to address the question, \"what do you believe and why?\".{.me} Conclusions All in all, Peter does a lousy job and seemed completely unprepared to deal with this rather common understanding of the word faith. He also insisted on using the \"belief without evidence\" instead of the more honest \"belief without sufficient evidence\". When people say there is no evidence for something (like God, UFOs, astrology, psychic phenomena, etc...), they really mean that there is terrible evidence for something. There is some evidence for astrology, it's just that it is terrible evidence. The exaggerated, more simple, phrase of \"belief without evidence\" is counterproductive, especially when the more accurate phrase, \"belief without sufficient evidence\", is nearly as simple. {.me} Peter does say that by claiming faith, one is \"assigning a confidence value to a belief higher than what is warranted by the evidence.\" This doesn't roll off the tongue quite as well as \"pretending to know things you do not know\", and he should have made clear the distinction between the precise language and the slightly hyperbolic simplifications.{.me} I also feel that words like faith are so slippery as to be useless, and in fact dangerous in a debate or discussion. It is too easy to slide from probability to utility and back when using the word faith. Although I might advise one to stick to the math, I think the equations are just more concise representations of the statements that could be made in plain English. {.me}","tags":"Unbelievable Project","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Jul/24/faith-trust-and-evidence/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Jul/24/faith-trust-and-evidence/"},{"title":"Bayesian vs Frequentist Perspectives","text":"Jake VanderPlas has what I believe is the clearest, and most thorough, take-down of the frequentist approach to statistical inference. It's in four parts, so far. The third part , in my opinion, is the clearest example of the differences in the approaches, demonstrating the superiority of the Bayesian approach, and why frequentist statistics is wrong in science. The four parts are: Frequentism and Bayesianism: A Practical Introduction Frequentism and Bayesianism II: When Results Differ Frequentism and Bayesianism III: Confidence, Credibility, and why Frequentism and Science do not Mix Frequentism and Bayesianism IV: How to be a Bayesian in Python One of the reasons I particularly like this series is that the examples are explored with simple Python code, which makes it completely obvious what is going on. Computer simulations force one to put all of the assumptions down explicitly, and to see what the practical differences are.

If you are unfamiliar with presuppositional apologetics, it doesn't use evidence at all and can be a frustrating process. Have a look at what stands in for a proof of God from the Sye's website . A nice summary, and some tactics to use against presuppositionalists, can be found at the Reasonable Doubts Podcast . In this post I want to summarize the initial \"argument\" put forward by Sye: Premise: It's reasonable to believe that which is true Premise: It's true that God exists Therefore, it's reasonable to believe that God exists After presenting this \"argument\", he claims that he doubts that Matt will challenge the first premise, and he was correct. I, however, challenge the first premise - it is not always reasonable to believe in true things. For something to be reasonable , it must mean that you have followed the proper procedures of inductive reasoning, or in other words, are applying probability theory properly. This means that the confidence in a claim must scale with the available evidence. For it to be reasonable to believe in something , it must rise to a level of probability that you would label it as \"belief\". Does this ever happen, or should this ever happen, with untrue things? Certainly. Here are a few that come to mind. the world is flat - as long as you are constrained to not live near the shore, or see a lunar eclipse life is designed - before the advent of Darwin's theory of natural selection the Sun, and the stars, all go around the Earth - until the advent of physics In each of these cases there is in fact strong evidence for the claims, and against the counter claims, to make it reasonable to believe them (at the time). It no longer is reasonable - the process of reason forces one to re-weight the probabilities of the hypotheses given new evidence, and to discard those hypotheses that become too improbable. I'd like to see Sye to define reason. Even if we assume his God is real, the process of God-given reason needs to be consistent with what we already establish for inductive reason. There is no spot in it for special pleading, so it would undermine the thing he is claiming. For example, proper reasoning concludes that special revelation is not reliable, and thus cannot be used as strong evidence for adjusting probabilities. If Sye is making the claim that even using logic presupposes God, he needs to define reason in such a way that it doesn't turn back on his presupposition. Of course, he won't, because all presuppositionalist arguments are circular.","tags":"articles","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Jun/06/its-unreasonable-to-believe-some-true-things/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Jun/06/its-unreasonable-to-believe-some-true-things/"},{"title":"Free, or Not-So-Free, Will","text":"I felt compelled to write this post, for some reason. Reading an interesting article about free will has gotten me thinking about it again, despite the fact that doing so makes my head hurt a bit. It is easy to go in circles with this. I have given my initial perspective elsewhere , and this article doesn't really sway me from that. Roy Baumeister in the above article states: These arguments leave untouched the meaning of free will that most people understand, which is consciously making choices about what to do in the absence of external coercion, and accepting responsibility for one's actions. Hardly anyone denies that people engage in logical reasoning and self-control to make choices. There is a genuine psychological reality behind the idea of free will. The debate is merely about whether this reality deserves to be called free will. There is no need to insist that free will is some kind of magical violation of causality. Free will is just another kind of cause. The causal process by which a person decides whether to marry is simply different from the processes that cause balls to roll downhill, ice to melt in the hot sun, a magnet to attract nails, or a stock price to rise and fall. He states this with no support whatsoever. He presents some analogies, like: No number of facts about a carbon atom can explain life, let alone the meaning of your life. These causes operate at different levels of organization. Even if you could write a history of the Civil War purely in terms of muscle movements or nerve cell firings, that (very long and dull) book would completely miss the point of the war. Free will cannot violate the laws of physics or even neuroscience, but it invokes causes that go beyond them. It is true that we don't typically describe things like the Civil War in terms of the underlying physics, but that is a practical limitation of human knowledge. If we had infinite faculties for such descriptions, then one could even get the \"point of the war\" from the \"muscle movements or nerve cell firings\". In just the same way that we use the concept of entropy when we cannot specify the locations and speeds of all of the molecules of air in the room, we use the concept of free will to summarize and label our ignorance. It becomes real, as entropy is real, but doesn't mitigate the ultimate determinism of the system. Finally, he gets to the topic of agency with The evolution of free will began when living things began to make choices. The difference between plants and animals illustrates an important early step. Plants don't change their location and don't need brains to help them decide where to go. Animals do. Free will is an advanced form of the simple process of controlling oneself, called agency. So, when a flower opens in the day and closes a night, or even follows the sun , how is that different than the animal \"choosing\" to run toward rewards and away from punishments? It isn't different, except in complexity, but complexity alone does not elliminate fundamental determinism or produce freedom.","tags":"articles","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Jun/04/free-or-not-so-free-will/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Jun/04/free-or-not-so-free-will/"},{"title":"Do healing miracles happen?","text":"As part of the Unbelievable Project , I am taking notes and \"arm-chair\" responding to each of the Unbelievable podcast episodes satisfying a set of simple rules . See here for a full RSS Feed of the podcasts . Description of Episode Full Title: Do healing miracles happen? Robby Dawkins & David Beebee - Unbelievable? - 15 March 2014 Robby Dawkins (not to be confused with Richard) says he regularly sees healing miracles occur for the people he prays for. Cancer is gone, blind eyes see, pain disappears, even a lung was re-grown. David Beebee, an atheist sceptic with an interest in the charismatic church interacts with Dawkins and questions why we don't see more convincing proof, and what he does about the 'misses'. We also hear from a Christian who is sceptical of modern miracle claims, Dr Peter May. Download mp3 . Justin Brierley - Christian Moderator Robby Dawkins - Christian David Beebee - Atheist Dr Peter May -Christian, skeptic Comments by myself, bblais Notes Justin - He starts the conversation by stating that \"miracle stuff\" is considered a bit \"out there\" , that it's \"very difficult to verify, it's not objective in the way we can talk about evidence for God and the Bible, and that kind of thing\" . It's funny how he started off like that. They steer clear of miracles in this show because it is hard to verify, and not objective evidence for God. The funny thing about that statement is that it is just totally wrong! In fact, miracles would be objective evidence if there were a God. So, if even some miracle claims were verified, they would be trumpeted as the most objective evidence for the existence of God and the claims of the Bible. The fact Justin Brierley can say that the claims are \"not objective\" is pretty much an admission that there is no good evidence for miracles and the entire topic should be avoided. It has disagreeable consequences for the theology if they really have to confront the question \"where did all the miracles go?\" - they seem to be common and public in ancient days, yet disappear as our understanding of science improves. Starting off the show like that is already an admission of failure. So Robby Dawkins claims he prayed for a guy who was going to have open heart surgery, and that the guy also had half a lung removed in the past due to lung cancer. The story claims that the surgeon opened him up, and said \"This man has the heart of a 30-year old man, and the lungs have regrown\". That is a fantastic story. I don't believe it. So, the question is, who's right, and should I be that skeptical? Here is someone giving this story, and I don't have any of the details such as the name of the person, etc... I am going to look this up and I would bet money (I never bet more than a dollar on any bet) , but I'd be willing to bet $1 that this story doesn't pan out. The reason is that the story is totally ridiculous and fantastic. If it were true, I would have heard about it before. If they actually had medical records of the guy, before and after scans of the heart and lungs, it would be totally trivial to demonstrate this to the satisfaction of pretty much any skeptic. The fact that I haven't heard about it probably means that it is made up. The data should be able to sway me from my skepticism, if it is real. If it is anything like the UFO cases I've read or the other healing cases I've read, it will either: Not have enough information to verify at all - just the story, with no evidence or Turn out to be wrong This has been the case for every miracle claim and UFO claim I have ever taken the time to investigate. Why would someone make up a story about this? One is to feel better about the world, another is that it was a mundane story that got distorted over time. One thing is clear is that Robby Dawkins has a vested interest in this story. Then they relay a movie, where Robby Dawkins supposedly heals a young man, Jacob, of neck and back pain. He prays 3 times over the young man. The first time the next pain goes down to a \"zero\", but the back is still at a \"seven\", the second time the back goes down to a \"one\", and then down to a \"zero\" for last prayer. Here we have a crowd around the young man during the prayer, and a completely subjective reporting of pain. Don't you think there is significant social pressure on this young man to claim more pain loss than he actually experiences? Robby Dawkins, in the clip, jokes with the young man \"you're not just being nice to me, are you?\" What is he supposed to say to that? This is the problem with \"healing\" pain this way - there is nothing objective to measure, no way to test if there is in fact an effect. Is it more likely that the young man is lying, or perhaps distorting due to the social pressures, than he's actually healed? Absolutely. In order to test this, one would have to have an objective way to verify, which is not presented. I'm reminded again of the website http://whywontgodhealamputees.com/ . Sure, God can heal these vague issues like my back pain this hour, but can't seem to heal anything tangible. He finishes his miracle healing by asking the young man to touch his toes. Now this is a somewhat objective measure, rather than the 0-10 pain scale, which may reflect objective evidence of an improvement from the prayer. If he couldn't touch his toes before, because of the pain, and now he can then that would be at least some evidence (not convincing, but some) toward the efficacy of the prayer. Could the young man touch his toes afterward? No. What did Robby Dawkins do? He made a joke about it - \"That's about as far as I could do\". I have to wonder, if it had come out a different way what would the response have been? This is emblematic of the approach of unskeptical people. You do a test that you think might point in the right direction (generally not done very carefully), but you design the test so that you win either way. If it works, then it's a miracle, and if it doesn't then it is shrugged off as something the person needs to work on, you shouldn't have passed the test anyway, etc... Essentially a rationalization. Heads, I win. Tails, you lose. Perhaps another test is done that shows some mild improvement from before, and that is touted as the evidence while the counter examples are quietly ignored. Selective bias, completely unskeptical. There is nothing miraculous about any of the things Robby Dawkins actually demonstrated in these examples. One could claim I'm being hyperskeptic, and yes, I am being skeptical. I am demanding that if you make a claim that violates my understanding of the laws of physics, and the way the universe works, then you had better pony up an equivalent amount of evidence that the people who established those laws of physics did in the first place. You should be able to convince the skeptics, because that is exactly what the scientists have done to get us here. They have taken things where people were skeptical, such as germ theory of disease, plate tectonics, big bang cosmology, etc... and provided testable predictions that were borne out, especially when unintuitive. In the germ theory of disease, something as simple as washing your hands should reduce infection - which is demonstrably does. This would be very difficult to explain if you believed disease were some kind of spiritual phenomenon (which was once believed) or an imbalance in the humors, or some kind of energy imbalance. This is before even having a microscope to confirm the small living beings called germs. We don't need to understand how miracles occur to verify that they occur, so it is not an argument against the skeptic to accuse them of a naturalistic bias. It is not a bad thing to be skeptical. It keeps you from being taken in by false claims, from falling victim to selection bias, etc... Robby - \"Some people would say that they felt better, but I found out later that they still had some pain. I found out that this girl that had scoliosis, her shoulders were severely tilted, said \"It is better\", but I could see that her shoulders were not 100% straight. And I would be like, I need to get a number from them because I'm not getting a clear answer.\" So he's trying to be more quantitative, which is a good thing, it's still not any better than what it was before. This is not a controlled setting, there is a serious vested interest for the child to say that they are feeling better, and there is no way to independently verify that they are in fact getting better in the cases that he is talking about. It is still a subjective claim, while sounding more quantitative with the number. It makes it sound more scientific, but it is no better than them saying \"I'm feeling better.\" Justin - \"How often does it work, as it were, that people go down to a two or a zero?\" Robby - \"It's a hard question, but I would say more than half of the times...I'd say probably around 65% of the time. If people let you keep praying for them, it will go down. But some people get freaked out by the fact that something is happening, and they will be 'all right, stop.'\" Here's another interesting case. He's making a bold claim that it is working 65% of the time, but it's hard to tell, which lets him write off the failures. But these seem like much better odds than science-based medicine, if it is correct. He's also saying that people want him to stop, because they experience the change. That let's him write off anyone who stops early, while still maintaining that it is working, so in his mind it remains evidence that it is working. Again, maybe there are other explanations. Perhaps they are freaking out because there is a crowd that is expecting something, and nothing is happening, which would totally be uncomfortable for someone. Again, they are setting up a situation where people have a vested interest to lie, not out of a malicious intent, but to simply cover themselves from an embarrassing situation, for themselves, the congregation or the minister. David - \"If someone is feeling better then that is great...\" Ok, I'm going to interrupt, and comment on that little amount. Yes, it is good if they are feeling better - no one wants another to be in pain. But I think it does matter how they are feeling better. If a doctor gave a sugar pill, said that it would help the pain, the patient gets the transient pain relief from placebo effect - I don't think that's a good thing. When the pain comes back, they haven't dealt with the symptoms, and they are likely to return to the same bogus treatment. I think back on a friend of mine who pursued dubious so-called alternative medical treatments, while her (unknown to her at the time) cancer progressed. She kept going back to these treatments, like acupuncture and homeopathy, when the placebo pain relief ended. In the end the cancer was too advanced by the time it was diagnosed, so it really does matter not just that you feel better, but why . It's not always a good thing that someone is feeling better, if by feeling better makes them worse in the long run. David - \"it doesn't seem to be something that could be explained by a much simpler set of assumptions. for example, they are in a suggestive, persuasive environment, on stage. If they already believe that it could happen anyway, then the strong personality speaking to them, even with the caveats of 'are you just being nice to me', there still would be some psychological pressure to conform, even if subconscious.\" Bingo! Justin - \"You'd probably prefer the simpler explanation, it's probably adrenaline, probably psychological pressure,...\" David - \"Not probably, but it could be these things, and we know that these things happen routinely. \" That was a nice catch. We have a whole host of possible explanations, all of which are more likely than a miracle healing, and any one of them (or multiple ones) would work but the person claiming the miracle would have to rule those out at least to justify this more complex more fantastical explanation of \"miracle\". The skeptic need to pin any of these alternatives on the particular case. The skeptic is not making the knowledge claim that they are confident in a particular explanation, they are just not convinced of the more complex and fantastical explanation. Robby - \"I had three young men who were atheists, and said \"You're full of it.\" I appreciate your honesty. I grabbed the microphone as we were finishing this healing session and I asked if anyone had leg shortening. Since we had war survivors there, we had about 8 people come forward who had a leg shorter than another. And I had those guys, and said to just say the words, and they said that they didn't believe in it. I just told them to repeat the words after me, and we held the legs...and the all the legs were clear.\" David - Why is God limited to incremental leg extensions, as opposed to a full amputee? It would be so simple to document a healed amputee to the satisfaction of a skeptic. If this works 50% of the time they should be able to go to a convention of war veterans, or the paralympics, or something like that and heal 50% of the cases. I'd be satisfied with 10%...actually, I'd be satisfied with 1%, but the number is in fact zero . It makes you wonder why, when there is actual evidence to look at, it is always only the things that are either subjective easily manipulated small scale and never the big stuff, never the things that are easy to show actually happened. You don't even need to show that the prayer itself did it, just one case of an amputee regrowing a limb would at least show there is some effect there. Justin - \"Is David asking for too high a level of evidence here?\" Robby - \"No, I don't. Here's the bottom line. Bottom line is it requires faith ...and faith is risk. And faith is a hard thing to risk.\" I think he may go on to define his use of the word \"faith\", but I think he's using it in the way that I use it, and that is \"believing things without appropriate evidence\". Yes, that is risky! It's a dumb risk, you shouldn't do it. It's a needless risk. He's playing the \"Oh, you're asking for too much evidence, and I expect you to believe this without the evidence\" card. Robby - \"I did this all over Princeton University, an epicenter for atheists and skeptics, and many people were sitting there watching legs grow out and going 'Whoa'. They would say 'if I could see this happen, then I'd believe it' and then they sat there and watched it happen and responded 'no, no, no, this must have been happening, or that must have been happening'. There's always going to be another explanation.\" That is the moment that I have seen in so many of these. It's really the cry-baby response - \"Boo hoo! You're asking for too much evidence! You're not convinced by my flimsy attempts at demonstrating this!\" This sort of response just would not fly in any scientific arena, and that attitude just annoys me after a while. You have something to claim that you think is true...great. You should be able to demonstrate it to skeptics. They will come up with alternative explanations...great...that's their job, and the absolute right response to you making an extraordinary claim. That's what they are supposed to do, and if you can't demonstrate that it is not one of their alternative explanations, then you haven't done your job. That's the job that every scientist has to do, and sometimes it takes years, and sometimes it takes being more clever at designing the experiment and the proper controls, but you have to do that. You propose that the universe is accelerating , which wasn't on anyones radar, and people don't believe it, what do you do? You improve the data, you lower the uncertainties, you demonstrate how it fits in the understood cosmology. You address, and rule out, the alternative explanations and the possible biases. You say that anyone can inspect your methods, reproduce it themselves. If it is true, then the skeptics come around. The alternative explanations are not bad. The skepticism is not bad, it is the correct process of getting to the truth. Things that collapse under that pressure are probably not true. That's what it means to demonstrate something. It doesn't mean showing it once, under uncontrolled circumstances, from a distance, where the skeptics can't reproduce it. That's not demonstrating it, that's a trick . And people have seen magic tricks, and so they'll acknowledge that you've done a trick, even if they don't know exactly how it was done. They'll think 'if I try to do it, it won't work', or 'under this other set of circumstances, it won't work', etc... Like the spoon bending of Uri Geller. The problem is not just that these people are mistaken, but that they don't seem to recognize that the skeptical response is the proper one, and that if they actually had something to demonstrate that they should have no problem convincing the skeptics. If you claim to have an effect that worked 50% of the time that cured various diseases, especially physical structural ones, you should be able to an MRI or some other scan, do the prayer, then do the scan afterward and see a measurable effect. In addition, you should enthusiastically do that...\"Game on! I think something here, so let's show it in the most quantifiable, reproducible way possible, in front of the skeptics!\" That's what the attitude should be ...if you think something is true. That's what science is - it's an attitude. It's that attitude that you test everything, that you don't believe anything until demonstrated, and you find ways to measure things to the point where even the skeptics are convinced. And that is the stuff we know is true, and everything else is questionable. These faith healers don't demonstrate the attitude, or ability, or the willingness to put their money where their mouth is. They have a ton of anecdotes, a bunch of things in uncontrolled circumstances that they claim are significant but just are not, and that is the problem. Then they chide the skeptics for being skeptics, for not being convinced by these parlor tricks. I'm sorry, but that won't convince me. Too bad...grow up...and don't cry about people demanding a lot of evidence. That's just the wrong wrong attitude. Robby - \"It could be a stadium, let's say Wimbledon is filled and somebody sees someone raised from the dead. There's going to be, say, 'it's mass hypnosis', there's always going to be something. It always comes down to this place of saying 'I'm choosing to have faith', 'I'm choosing to believe' \" This is exactly what I said he would say about faith - he is choosing to believe, even though the evidence doesn't support it. You have 100,000 people see someone raised from the dead, yet have no actual data on it? Yes, that's likely to be mass hypnosis, or hysteria, or whatever. Fatima, is a good example of that, which I cover elsewhere . But if you had 100000 independent iphone videos, along with skeptical doctors following proper procedures, and they all say that this guy was dead for week and came back, then yes I would be convinced. But there is never ever data on that scale - it's always this flimsy, anecdotal, incremental, subjective crap that we get again and again that convinces the believer who chooses to believe, but doesn't convince anyone else. The same thing happens with alien abductions...the exact same thing happens. David - \"It would take extraordinary evidence, if you are going to make an extraordinary claim about something that doesn't happen routinely. The sort of evidence that would convince me that it happened would have to be similar. My question is, why do we get all sorts of stories of minute incremental centimeter changes in leg lengths, but nothing where it is entire regeneration?\" David - He demonstrates that a simple hip motion can give the illusion of leg lengthening, without it actually happening, and adds that the person need not be doing it consciously, that they are responding the psychological pressure of the session. So here is one plausible explanation for the leg adjustment (there are probably many others), so the question I'd ask the Robby is - have there been any steps done to eliminate that as a possible explanation? For example, an actual amputation can't be \"recovered\" in this way. Some objective measure of length used, perhaps from a body scan, and measured off the image from a consistent point (edge of hip to bottom of heel, for example). You cannot play the card \"these people are honest, they don't have any reason to lie\" [even though they do!], that's just not the point. If it could possibly be explained by hip adjustment, how would you design the test to eliminate that as a possibility - this is what a scientist does and not at all what these people do. Justin - \"Is it still relevant that it happened when she was prayed for in a healing session, that it happened then ? Can you at least acknowledge that it is an interesting correlation?\" David - \"Absolutely not. What would it take to convince you that it is not real? Because, to make any sense at all, you have to count the misses not just the hits, because if you are only counting the hits and ignoring the misses, your confirmation bias insulates you from any refutation of what you believe. You have to look into how many times people have been prayed for and nothing happens at all.\" Justin - \"And you're [Robby] perfectly open to saying that happens sometimes...\" Robby - \"Oh, yes. It happens all the time.\" That's correct - it happens all the time. You can't even count how many prayers people do, and they don't appear to work nearly all the time. Occasionally they appear to work - but this doesn't establish a correlation. This reminds me of the so-called tie between eclipses and earthquakes that is sometimes claimed. Unfortunately, eclipses happen so often that you're guaranteed to have an eclipse before an earthquake. If you pray all the time, the random medical improvements that people have will be guaranteed to be after a prayer. If you only report the events where you prayed and there was an improvement, then you'll seriously bias your conclusions. This is why one needs to do controlled prayer studies, to include all the cases - both successes and failures. When you do this for prayer, some studies there's an improvement, in others things get worse, in all of them the effect is barely measurable. This is exactly the sort of result you get from treatments that ultimately are shown not to have any real effect. Nothing ever comes close to these wild claims by Robby Dawkins that the healing effects happen \"more than half the time\" and that, by itself, is a refutation of what he's talking about. Now he could say, \"Look, you have to do it in a Church setting, do it under the auspices of a minister, and perhaps a particular kind of minister, etc...\" One might be able to design a controlled experiment around this stipulations, as long as those stipulations are specific enough. If the stipulation is something like \"it doesn't work when skeptics are around\", that doesn't count. When asked why his own thyroid disease, despite prayers, has not been cured Robby's answer is - the devil does it! Robby - \"There's a spiritual opposition and there is a power of the enemy that is contending against that.\" David - \"That is introducing yet another untestable unknown to the equation, which is ballooning with unknowns. That doesn't get us anywhere toward what is objectively happening.\" Justin - \"What I'm seeing here myself is two completely different worldviews coming together...you don't believe, David, that there is a spiritual realm...full stop. Robby is convinced there is, and so for Robby this is the explanation.\" I've heard this \"blame the worldviews\" thing before, but I think that's bogus. The reason it is bogus is that, if there really is an agent opposing you, you should be able to tell that it is really an agent and that it is really opposing you, not just \"sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, it must be an agent\". That's not enough. It cannot be simply be that we can explain this with an agent, you have to be able to demonstrate that it is likely to be an agent because of X, Y, and Z. You can interpret the seasons, for example, as driven by agents (as the pagans do), but that doesn't make it so. It can't be post-hoc: if it doesn't work, it's the agent working against me, if it does work, it is another agent working for me. That doesn't wash, and it is not a matter of worldviews . The reason why I don't think there is a spiritual realm is that no one has posited evidence for the spiritual realm that is even remotely consistent or has any real content. Robby - \"I think what I see in every dialog with atheists like this, the kind of communication is, don't tell me about the headache being better, I want to know a whole limb growing out...but what about the person who is feeling better with the headache? Are we just throwing them out, that they don't matter? .... There is a video of a guy's toe, his big toe is missing, and after prayer it appears. There is a video, but I don't have it in my possession. Of course, anyone could say, that the film was doctored. It all comes down to an issue of faith. \" David - \"I would need multiple, independent video of the same event. The hard thing for your position is that, with the proliferation of technology, almost everyone in the western world has a high quality 1080p camcorder in their pocket. If these things routinely happen, as much as is professed with testimony, there is no way that it wouldn't be captured by somebody somewhere, multiple people somewhere.\" This is the same thing with UFO claims - the number of visitations and observances of UFOs has gone down with the proliferation of the technology to record it, rather than the significant increase of recorded UFO events one would expect to happen if these things were real. This is strong evidence against the veracity of the claims. Notice what he's doing here. He's asking why we want to ignore the small effect (e.g. headache). I'd say, that he's making huge claims, so we'd need a comparable effect. If the headache goes away on its own without prayer much of the time, then you haven't demonstrated that the prayer actually made the headache go away, and that is the entire point. He still has this \"cry-baby\" response, that we'll be skeptical of the video. This is one of the reasons that science is hard - you do have to do the leg-work to design the experiment so that it is reproducible and eliminates the alternatives. That is a good thing. One could interpret the prayer as witchcraft, and that the nature spirits are coming in to heal the headache. Would you be convinced by that? Would Robby be convinced? How would he respond if the person said \"you just have to have faith\"? Robby - (about the facts surrounding the lung regeneration story earlier) \"The original facts that I got from the medical report, it was on an old scroll fax without the best of ink, and since then it's faded. Somebody did contact the doctor to see if they had a newer hard copy of the report since, but the doctor has since passed away, so it's been hard to get a hold of that information.\" David - \"It's a common theme, isn't it? Craig Marsh is it, with the stomach, and the eye in Peru...where there is a really tremendous example, there is always something like 'we've go the evidence but it's just not here, someone won't publish it', it's always supposedly there but never actually there.\" That is totally the common theme. They said that they tried to publish it in the medical journal, and the journal said it was 'too weird' and wouldn't publish it. That is ridiculous. If it is really weird, and true, then they'd love to see it! The only reason they wouldn't publish it is if was terribly written or there was no evidence of it. Also, this sounds suspiciously like Joseph Smith and the Golden Plates . Justin - \"Those kind of verified medical records released, are hard to come by, and for miracles that occur in the developing world there are no such services to verify all of these.\" No, that's not quite correct. It is all the time, it's every single case. There is not a single case where there has been good documentary evidence of a significant miracle...not a single case in all of the anecdotes. If you contrast that with 50-60% of the healings work, that is devastating and is an indication of something that just doesn't work. How else could you explain that there is not a single case of well-documented miracle? Justin - \"There is some nervousness with some physicians that this could look like 'I misdiagnosed the illness', so I am not going to be easily releasing the medical records because this might come back to bite me.\" Robby - \"I've talk to doctors where this is the case.\" This is the first legitimate issue raised, I believe, but it still falls under the umbrella of \"it's hard to get data sometimes\". Boo hoo, cry-baby again. Does Robby think that it is a walk in the park to get the supernova data and make sure things are calibrated properly to establish the accelerating universe , or to find the Higgs Boson ? Does he think that was really easy to do? One doesn't have to get medical records from the doctors, one can get them from the patients and the families who can release whatever they want without feeling nervous. If I can come up with, in one minute, an easy work-around for this problem, then Robby clearly is not putting much effort to do so. Robby - (about a woman who had cancer supposedly healed, describing what the doctor would put in the report) \"The doctor said 'you prayed for her, and that is the only explanation I have'. I asked him, 'what will go in your report?', and he goes that 'she is cancer free, that it is gone. I'd put down that it was there, and that we are not seeing any traces of it.' I asked him if he'd put down that she received prayer, and he said 'No, I wasn't in the room, and that would not be part of the treatment anyway so I would not document that'. And so that is very typical, and I understand that.\" He's taking the successes again and ignoring the misses. He's very quick to say that this is the result of the prayer, and not some other random thing, but when it doesn't appear to work 99.999% of the time when nothing happens, he responds with \"the devil\" or \"God's plan\" or individual unwillingness to accept the miracle. It always works when it works, and there is an excuse when it doesn't. This is not how we do science, and it is totally obvious selection bias. David - \"We do know that strange and unexplainable things happen, the body is a complex, messy system, and it really is the case the cancer does spontaneously remiss. That does happen with and without prayer. If someone prays for it, and it happens, you could try to say that the prayer worked but it doesn't mean anything unless you count the times that it doesn't work. So what I'd like to really ask, is there anything that would make you not believe it works?\" This last question will just flew over Robby's head, because I don't think he understands the attitude of constructing falsifiable claims. For someone who is not a skeptic, I don't think he understand what it even means to craft claims in this way. I think a better way to put that is, once you recognize that cancer going away happens with or without prayer sometimes , if you know that pain goes way with or without prayer sometimes (all it takes is sometimes ) - and you can insert for 'prayer' here 'new medical treatment X' - how do you figure out some way to distinguish between X causing the cancer to go away and the cancer going away for totally unknown and unrelated reasons. How do you do that, when you don't know and can't control those unrelated effects? What you do is to create a study, with a control group, blinded, etc... and you look at how often cancer goes away with and without X., counting all the successes and failures. What is found when you do that carefully is that prayer has no effect, or such a tiny effect to be totally meaningless. This is how you do it. If you can't distinguish between doing X and nothing, then that is equivalent to nothing. This is totally at odds with the grand claims Robby is making. Robby - \"You believe that things can happen out of nothing...and that is a really high level of faith.\" This is adding insult to injury. This is just false. We don't understand why things like cancer sometimes disappear, but that doesn't mean that we believe there is no cause. There is certainly some reason for it, but we just don't have access to it (at the moment). We don't know the conditions specific enough for the reason something worked in this case, and not another. We just don't know. If you're making the further claim that you can improve the situation with prayer, the only way to justify this claim is by isolating the variables, and doing a proper study. It has nothing to do with faith, it is simply saying that some things happen that we don't understand, not the positive claim that there is no cause. A few final thoughts on the episode. I did try to confirm the story of the man regrowing the lung or heart. I couldn't find any reference to it at all, except for the claims in Robby Dawkins' book, from which it appears that he was essentially reciting in the episode. He has this story, with no details at all, not even a city, a year, a hospital,...nothing, just nothing to go on. It could be that I didn't look long enough, but it makes me wonder if this guy simply made up the story because it sounds great and is a total dead-end for anyone trying to confirm it. I'd love to see the data! Now, how should Robby respond to this insinuation that he may be lying? He should be mad, I believe. Great! Robby, show me that I'm wrong. Present to me the evidence that you have for this bold claim, and I will take this back. I'd love to know that I'm wrong. Bring out the documentation. As of now, I can't tell the difference between a total fabrication, Robby simply being mistaken, or this even actually happened. If I can't tell that difference, I go with what is most likely, and a story like this totally benefits Robby, so he has a definite vested interest in making it up or uncritically accepting a rumor that he heard and proliferating it. Show me that I'm wrong...I'd love it. This is difference between scientists and many others. Let's end with an analogy. Let's say I claim that voodoo dolls actually work. Just the other day, I was mad at someone, I made a doll of them, poked a pin in their head, and they got a headache. I've done this many times - I've given people back aches, knee pain, etc... I've even caused someone serious harm, say, with a pin through the heart. No, I'm sorry I don't have any documentation for it or, I did have documentation for it but it's gone now, or the doctor verified that there was a large hole through this person's heart and they have the documentation but won't release it, etc... But you can examine all these cases where someone got a headache, or back aches, because of my voodoo dolls. No, it doesn't happen all of the time, but it happens most of the time. And when it doesn't happen, there are positive spirits that keep that from happening - but the voodoo dolls really work more the 65% of the time. How is this any different from Robby's claims? I doubt Robby would believe this, but the question is why? What process did he use to come to the negative conclusion that he couldn't have used on his own claims?","tags":"Unbelievable Project","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Jun/03/do-healing-miracles-happen/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Jun/03/do-healing-miracles-happen/"},{"title":"A Good Bet Lost","text":"So I was sitting in the cafeteria the other day, and there was a clock which showed the wrong time and the second hand was being weird.

I thought the proponents of dualism were credulous, and ignored the specific requests by the opponents to rule out alternatives. I'll get into that in another post, but I had to respond to this one point immediately, because it is so easy to confirm that it jumped out at me. At time point 1h26m29s we have the following: Eben Alexander: The very renowned skeptic and scientist Carl Sagan admitted that past-life memories in children, the evidence for that is overwhelming. He said that in his book, the Demon Haunted World, on page 302, he says exactly that . (emphasis original) Steve Novella: I've read that book 100 times, Carl Sagan did not believe in past lives, he did not believe in anything paranormal or supernatural, that is just not true . (emphasis original) It turns out that I have that book on my bookshelf, and so it was an easy matter to check this claim. Here is the quote of the entire paragraph referenced from the Demon Haunted World, page 302, Perhaps one percent of the time, someone who has an idea that smells, feels, and looks indistinguishable from the usual run of pseudoscience will turn out to be right. Maybe some undiscovered reptile left over from the Cretaceous period will indeed be found in Loch Ness or the Congo Republic; or we will find artifacts of an advanced, non-human species elsewhere in the Solar System. At the time of writing there are three claims in the ESP field which, in my opinion, deserve serious study: (1) that by thought alone humans can (barely) affect random number generators in computers; (2) that people under mild sensory deprivation can receive thoughts or images \"projected\" at them; and (3) that young children sometimes report the details of a previous life, which upon checking turn out to be accurate and which they could not have known about in any other way than reincarnation. I pick these claims not because I think they're likely to be valid (I don't), but as examples of contentions that might be true. The last three have at least some, although still dubious, experimental support. Of course, I could be wrong. It is very hard to imagine someone misreading this into thinking that Carl Sagan either believes these claims, or is claiming that they have overwhelming scientific support, given that he directly says he doesn't believe the claims and that the evidence is dubious!. I can see only two alternatives: the person making the claim doesn't expect anyone to check, and knows better - they are lying. the person actually believes that Sagan had this stance, from reading this paragraph - they have misread it so profoundly, it defies explanation. I recognize that it is nearly impossible to determine whether someone is lying, but this claim stands out as such a distortion it is hard to imagine under what circumstances an intelligent person could unknowingly make this claim, or even convince themselves that the claim is true. Perhaps they didn't read it, or stopped at the list of things that Sagan said \"deserves serious study\" and misread that as an endorsement? Given how specific this is, it is also hard to imagine that Eben Alexander hasn't used this argument before, in which case someone must have tried to correct him on it. If not, he needs to read this blog! If so, and he persists in this quote, then the distortion is almost certainly deliberate. Every way I try to wrap my brain around this exchange, I am perplexed and dismayed.","tags":"articles","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/May/16/supporting-dualism/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/May/16/supporting-dualism/"},{"title":"Siblings and Astronomy","text":"On a \"science is darn cool\" note, the sibling of the Sun has been found .

The intent of the graphic is to point out how silly those so-called global warming \"skeptics\" are . However, I think there is a hidden proposal there as well, worthy of an undergraduate project. If we call the \"skeptics\" model \\(M_S\\) and the \"realists\" model \\(M_R\\) , then we want the following probabilities: \\begin{eqnarray} P(M_S|{\\rm data}) \\end{eqnarray} and \\begin{eqnarray} P(M_R|{\\rm data}) \\end{eqnarray} where the data is the temperature data for the past 40 years (or farther, if you want to compare to the entire known global temperature record ). The reason that we consider the \"skeptics\" model as potentially silly is the direct consequence of the probability analysis. The \"realist\" model has two parameters, so when we calculate the model probability we marginalize over those parameters. \\begin{eqnarray} P(M_R|{\\rm data})= \\int_{\\alpha,\\beta} P(M_R|{\\rm data},\\alpha,\\beta)P(\\alpha,\\beta) \\end{eqnarray} where \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) are the slope and intercept of the linear model, respectively. We incur an Ockham penalty for each marginalized parameter. When we look at the \"skeptics\" model, we have the same. \\begin{eqnarray} P(M_S|{\\rm data})= \\int_{\\alpha_1,\\beta_1,\\alpha_2,\\beta_2,\\cdots,t_1,t_2,\\cdots} P(M_S|{\\rm data},\\alpha_1,\\beta_1,\\alpha_2,\\beta_2,\\cdots,t_1,t_2,\\cdots)P(\\alpha_1,\\beta_1,\\alpha_2,\\beta_2,\\cdots,t_1,t_2,\\cdots) \\end{eqnarray} where \\(\\alpha_1\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) are the slope and intercept, respectively, of the first line up to year \\(t_1\\) . \\(\\alpha_2\\) and \\(\\beta_2\\) are the slope and intercept, respectively, of the second line up to year \\(t_2\\) , etc.... Since we incur an Ockham penalty for each marginalized parameter, this model needs to fit the data substantially better than the \"realist\" model to achieve the same level of probability. What does substantially mean? That is the proposal - perhaps someone will do this proper probabilistic analysis of the problem.

I was reading an article about dualism where they point out 6 reasons that naturalism is false and that dualism must be true, as evidenced by properties of the mind and brain. It makes sense to respond to each of the claims in turn, and to focus on how we know what we know, how we can demonstrate dualism or not, and where to go from here. 1) First-person access to mental properties \"This concept of your dream car is not something that people can see by looking at your brain structure. Physical properties can be physically accessed, but the properties of your dream car and privately accessed\"{.theist} Although we are a bit far from publicly accessing as complex an object as a car, we can actually access brain states with various types of imaging and reconstruction. One interesting one is a reconstruction of concepts via fMRI by Tom Mitchell. Another is a movie reconstruction from brain activity by Jack Gallant. Both of these demonstrate that what was once privately held experiences can be publicly accessed as activity patterns in the brain. Note this is not \"looking at your brain structure\", it is looking at the process of the brain. Thus, the sorts of dichotomies present in this article between the mind and the structure of the brain are all strawmen. 2) Our experience of consciousness implies that we are not our bodies \"Common sense notion of personhood is that we own our bodies, but we are not our bodies\"{.theist} My first reaction with this is to think: \"Common sense notion of the world is that it is flat, and unmoving\"{.atheist} Since when do we use common sense to determine truth? It might be an initial guide, but our experience with relativity and quantum mechanics should immediately make one wary about using common sense as the sole method for determining the truth of a claim. It is true that we have a label, we call \"I\" or \"self\" which seems separate from the body, but that is no argument that they are actually separate. It is easy to see that this label is not the entire picture, where we can push the boundaries. For example, the E. coli bacteria in our gut we often think of as separate from ourselves, and yet we cannot live without it, and the distinction between these beings and ourselves is quite a bit blurred . What about the mitochondria in our cells? Are the separate from you? Are they not? It is a common pattern that, for any complex system, sharp distinctions are are rare. Animate vs inanimate, quantum systems vs classical, etc... To base ones objection to an idea because it isn't black and white is, frankly, childish. 3) Persistent self-identity through time \"When you change even the smallest part of a physical object, it changes the identity of that object. Every cell in your body is different from the body you had 10 years ago. If you are the same person you were 10 years ago, then you are not your physical body\" {.theist} So, as your tire tread wears down from your car, it ceases to be your car? When your mechanic changes the spark plugs, it is no longer your car? \"Your car\" is the convenient label we give an object that has some form of permanence, whether it be a permanence of form or function. The label obviously has some limits as a result. Swapping every piece of one car with another, even if done gradually, may in fact change its identity (i.e. label) or is might not - depends on whether the label itself is useful. We aren't talking about some Platonic pure forms here, or a pre-scientific essence , neither of which are demonstrable. When an amoeba splits, what about the identities of the resulting two? Is one of them the same original amoeba? Both of them? Neither (in which case the original one is simply gone)? Perhaps the simplistic picture of identity being used here is just not useful. The words may in fact not have any meaning. So the label that we ascribe to \"self\" is perfectly fine 10 years later, despite the changes in cells, because there is some permanence of form and function. Each new brain cell, for example, fills the shoes of the ones that went before in much the same way that factory workers take shifts - the process continues, even if the components change over time. If the mind is the process of the brain, as stated before, then this is no problem. If the label \"self\" leads to contradictions when pushed too far, then perhaps the label or the way we imagine the label being used is no longer appropriate in those situations. 4) Mental properties cannot be measured like physical objects \"Physical objects can be measured (e.g. – use physical measurements to measure weight, size, etc.). Mental properties cannot be measured. {.theist} Stated without support, and contradicted by the evidence above for (1). 5) Intentionality or About-ness \"Mental entities can refer to realities that are physical, something outside of themselves. A tree is not about anything, it just is a physical object. But you can have thoughts about the tree out there in the garden that needs water.\"{.theist} I'm not sure if this statement is even defined - what does it mean to be \"about\" something, such that a physical object can't be \"about\" something. Mental states, as represented by brain activity, are correlated with physical reality, can have representations of that reality (mental models) which are essentially a form of correlated activity, so in that sense mental states can be about physical reality. Of course there can be limited examples of this sort of correlation on a much simpler level. The ripples on a pond are correlated with the stone dropped in, for example. There is a very big difference between mental states and ripples on a pond, clearly, but the the notion of correlation with physical reality is shared between the two. I'd have to wait for a better definition of \"about\", used in this context, to make a better response. 6) Free will and personal responsibility \"If humans are purely physical, then all our actions are determined by sensory inputs and genetic programming.\" {.theist} No argument there. \"Biological determinism is not compatible with free will, and free will is required for personal responsibility.\" {.theist} Libertarian free will is what is being implied here, and I'd have to agree. There are other forms of \"free will\" which is completely consistent with biological determinism, such as those proposed by Dan Dennett . \"Our experience of moral choices and moral responsibility requires free will, and free will requires minds/souls.\" {.theist} Sorry, this doesn't follow. If free will is an illusion, perhaps a useful one for a functioning society, then our experience of it is in no way evidence of its existence. You would need to demonstrate this claim, beyond saying \"It feels like I have free will\" or \"It feels like I make moral decisions\". Again, just because it feels like the Earth is flat and unmoving doesn't mean it is so. So, in sum, we have evidence that the activity of the brain is identical to the mind. The claims made in the article quoted above amount to nothing but unsubstantiated assertions, and the appeal to so-called common sense and feeling deep down that it is true.

(said before listening to it) :-) {.me} David - After exploring the concepts, he has determined that things don't go from dinosaurs to birds, and so on, \"there is too much complexity for it to have happened by chance.\" {.theist} This one sentence alone, which was what he started out saying, demonstrates without any doubt that he has zero understanding of science, especially the process of evolution. By chance ? Not a single biologist on the planet makes the claim that this complexity arose by chance - a statement easily verified from any introductory biology textbook. With such a start, do I really need to listen to the rest of the argument? When someone demonstrates such a profound ignorance of the subject, can I trust that he has correctly assessed the evidence? If his sole motivation for seeking an alternative explanation is based on not understanding the original explanation, is there value in considering his point of view at all? I am not sure. {.me} David - The laying down of chalk deposits all around Europe is evidence of a large catastrophe. {.theist} Robert - Ice cores don't show evidence of a global flood, we have bristlecone pine trees that are over 5000 years old and others that are 10000 years old. Creationists like to be selective, and say that trees can lay down more than one ring in a year to try to cast doubt on the tree ring data. However, a bigger problem is that sometimes they don't lay down any rings in the year. Science is well aware of these problems, which is why they cross-reference to other methods, such as carbon dating, other tree rings, ice cores, the timing of known events such as volcanos, etc... {.atheist} Gregg - asked why there aren't fossils of people and fish and animals all mixed into all of the layers? To point out a few things that are laid down quickly, like volcanic (igneous) rock, doesn't support the general pattern. {.atheist} These are very good points. My favorite challenging question to creationists is \"how did the koala bear reach Australia after the flood?\" There isn't a single fossil of a koala from Mount Ararat to Australia. {.me} David - nothing could fossilize in the fractions of an inch per year necessary for building up these large calcium carbonate deposits. {.theist} Gregg - The creationists often have bizarre explanations for why the lower levels of the strata have simpler organisms and the upper levels have more complex organisms. The explanations are often like differential mobility yields order, i.e. \"the bigger dinosaurs would die and sink, birds are faster and fly, and that's why we get the order we have\". {.atheist} One way to ask it is, why is there not a single rabbit fossil in the pre-cambrian layers...one small, sick and slow rabbit which couldn't keep up with the others, etc...? There isn't even one dinosaur in the layer with humans? This is a reminder that one can come up with possible scenarios for anything, but at some point they require so many extra assumptions, or things to be just right that they strain credulity. {.me} Robert - Why is it that children are not found lower in the geological layering than the adults of the same species? {.atheist} David - When clams die they open up, and yet all the clam fossils are closed. This speaks to a catastrophic event.{.theist} Here again, there are no answers given to the obvious questions, and select examples (i.e. clams) are trotted out as if they demonstrate the entire pattern. The cherry-picking here is amazing! {.me} David - Darwin observed beak changes, not origin of species.{.theist} Going from Darwin's observations of small changes in an observable small time scale to speciation on the unobservable large time scale is a matter of inference, and does not require direct observation of speciation on the large scale to support it. Of course there are many observations of speciation , but that is not the point here. Creationists love to make a distinction between so-called micro-evolution (small change) and macro-evolution (large change), and then claim that all that is observed is micro-evolution. From this line of argument, you could never talk about nearly any process in astronomy, because they almost all take place over scales too long to observe. In astronomy, as in the field of evolution, one often sees snapshots of the process at many different times along the process, and have to infer the process. Once you infer the process, there are ways of testing it by directing your observations to certain things, like the detailed structure of galaxies or the detailed relationships in DNA codes. This is a basic property of all science, really, and I have disdain for the creationist diversions. {.me} David - Also the Bible says kinds , not species. Noah could have brought on one kind of wolf, not all kinds of dogs, for example. When it was pointed out that there would have had to have been a lot speciation in 4000 years or so, he countered that a lot can be done with breeding in that length of time. {.theist} Of course, he fails to address the issue here, because I'm fairly certain people have not been breeding beetles this entire time, and the number of species of beetles would have overwhelmed the ark. {.me} Robert brings up diversity, as measured by allele frequency, but I get the feeling that there are clearly, more direct arguments than the ones he is choosing to bring up. For example, the creationist would have to estimate speciation rates millions of times higher than is observed to get the diversity observed, and yet they still claim that speciation can't occur because of the slow process of evolution - you can't have it both ways! {.me} The episode wasn't nearly as painful as I expected, but it does highlight the level of cherry-picking and failure of proper scientific inference that is required to be a creationist.{.me}","tags":"Unbelievable Project","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Mar/19/noah-and-the-flood-did-it-happen-16-february-2008/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Mar/19/noah-and-the-flood-did-it-happen-16-february-2008/"},{"title":"How to Dodge the Consequences of Belief","text":"So I was recently reminded of an old interview of Alister McGrath by Richard Dawkins . When I first listened to this, quite some time ago, I recall feeling that McGrath was rather slippery, that I listened for an entire hour and still couldn't really determine what the guy actually believed was true. I listened to it again, over the past couple days, and can see why I had my initial impression. Faith They start with a discussion about the term faith , and McGrath basically says that we're dealing with a different situation than, for example, evidence that the moon orbits the earth at a certain distance and there are many possible ways of explaining [the world], and we have to make the very difficult judgement of which is the best of these [explanations]...evidence takes us thus far, but then when it comes to deciding between a number of competing explanations, it is extremely difficult to make an evidence-driven argument and I believe faith is rational, in the sense that it tries to make the best possible sense of things...even though we believe this is the best possible sense of things, we cannot prove this is the case...there is a point where [faith] goes beyond the evidence So essentially, as I read it, he is talking about probabilistic reasoning, yet if faith is simply probabilistic reasoning then why have another word? Why not talk about evidence, and the weight of probabilities? Historians, for example, don't use the word faith even though they deal with probabilities, some of which are highly uncertain. Scientists all the time deal with probabilities, without invoking the word faith in any paper. Further, McGrath ignores the fact that there already is a proper and rational method to address the \"decision between a number of competing explanations\", that doesn't go beyond the evidence, and doesn't claim more knowledge than is justified. What is this method? It's called the mathematics of probability! So, McGrath is claiming there is a problem that faith solves, which is not a problem at all, and he is using the word faith (at the moment) as synonymous with probability. Why is he doing this? It seems as if it is because McGrath is holding to a double standard, and shifts the definitions of concepts around whenever pressed. He doesn't like the notion of believing strongly without sufficient evidence (which is truly what faith is), so he defines it (at the moment) to be equivalent to probabilities. Of course he doesn't actually admit this, and if pressed he'd say that faith is more than a synonym for probability, but he fails to define it properly. Inference to the Best Explanation So McGrath basically then goes on to talk about probabilistic reasoning, and says that with faith one is doing inference to the best explanation , given a number of competing multiple explanations. As I stated earlier, if all he means is that faith is probabilistic reasoning, then we don't have an argument - except in making things clear. I would contend, along with Dawkins, the the vast majority of people do not take it to mean this. However, I'd like to also challenge his basic premise here: that in dealing with multiple competing explanations that one should try to \"infer to the best explanation\", and believe strongly in that explanation . A simple example, used in other contexts, suffices to see this. Say we have two explanations of the number of stars, one which says that there is an even number of stars and another that says that there is an odd number of stars. Pretty much we know that, at any given instant, one of these must be true. However strong belief in either one is completely unwarranted - there is simply no way to know. From a probabilistic framework, we express this as \\begin{eqnarray} P({\\rm odd}) &=&0.5 \\\\\\\\ P({\\rm even})&=&0.5 \\end{eqnarray} However, it is worse than that. Let's say we had a smidgen of evidence toward the even-star model, such that we had: \\begin{eqnarray} P({\\rm odd}) &=&0.499995 \\\\\\\\ P({\\rm even})&=&0.500005 \\end{eqnarray} Even though there is a best explanation here ( even is slightly more probable than odd ), and we have the exact probabilities, it is still irrational to hold strong belief in either explanation. One really does have to look where the weight of the probabilities lay. Inference to the best explanation fails as a guiding principle in the face of uncertainty, and is not well defined in all contexts. I don't think McGrath is actually doing proper probabilistic inference at all, but even if he were, this \"best explanation\" approach fails to address our knowledge of the problem. Playing Dodgeball with an Apologist So, here is how the game is played, and why I had my initial impression of slipperiness about McGrath. First it was \"faith is reasonable\", based on evidence, going beyond the evidence to the \"inference to the best explanation\" and that as a result one can have a reasonable faith in God When asked about his belief in a creator, and the evidence for it, despite having difficulty with the implied complexity of such a creator, he says I want to go back to CS Lewis who says I believe in Christianity as I believe the Sun has risen, not simply because I see it by by it I see everything else. Belief in God gives you a way of seeing the world that makes an awful lot of sense of it. When pressed on what this implies, he says that \"there are many reasons I believe in God and that [origins] is not even the primary one\" He then says that \"religion really isn't much about where things came from, about things in the distant past, but really about how things are now. How to live your life, how to be moral, etc...\" Then this becomes \"the key reason for believing God is Jesus, that there is something [in the Jesus story] that needs explanation\" Then this becomes that it is not really about the life of Jesus, and his historicity, but how he was perceived by his followers - the significance they saw in the life and teaching of Jesus. Notice how this keeps shifting? Every time he gets pushed on the specific consequences of his statement, he retreats, redefines, and redirects the conversation. He doesn't seem to realize that any explanation, even of things currently, entails assumptions that can be tested - perhaps with observations about the past. He can't simply say that religion is \"not about where things came from\", when they explicitly make statements of origins - statements which have been universally discredited. The atonement, for example, does depend critically on the existence of Jesus, the existence the \"Fall\", and a creator of the universe - for none of which did McGrath provide evidence. If Jesus didn't exist as a real person (or even if he was just an ordinary guy) then it doesn't matter that his followers simply believed that Jesus was God incarnate when determining ones belief in the doctrine of salvation. The demonstration of the historicity of the events claimed is necessary for the doctrinal belief. If you don't have strong evidence of the former, then you are not rational to believe strongly in the latter - you'd be claiming to know things you could not know. As a scientist, one takes an idea, and pushes the idea to it furthest consequences to see where it breaks, or to see what it depends on. McGrath changes the topic whenever this is done - he does not want to face the very real, specific consequences of his stated beliefs and refuses to see the connections between the things that may be confirmable (apparent design in the biology and the universe itself, historicity of people and events, alleged miracle claims, etc...) and the things that make him feel good, but are unmeasurable (existence of heaven, the atonement of sins, etc...). The Problem of Evil His biggest dodge came with the problem of evil. When initially asked about it, he says that there are two basic approaches. One is to \"find an explanation for it, but that doesn't get us really far because we can't really make sense of these things\". And the other approach is to address how to \"cope with suffering\" that is a part of this world. Now that is an amazing admission! He's basically missing the point of the argument, either willfully or otherwise, to focus on what feels good. He wants to wave away the real consequences of the beliefs he is claiming to have. McGrath was quick to make the following statements: God does not act directly in this world The single child saved in a tragedy killing ten thousand people he'd interpret as an act of God, and thus God is responsible for this child being saved. The killing of ten thousand people was not God's fault, but rather perhaps there is no other way for the universe to be this way See the contradictions here? McGrath couldn't. Either God acts in the world, and is measurable, or he does not act in the world and is thus either impotent, immoral, or simply indifferent. The problem of evil has no other outlet. If you try to argue (as William Lane Craig does) that God may have sufficient reasons, then you undermine the entire notion of personal conscience - the seemingly immoral actions (or inactions) of God fly in the face of it. One final thought McGrath stresses again and again the usefulness of religion, without once demonstrating that it is true . He failed, again and again, to address the immediate consequences of his beliefs and simply dodged at every point, in order to wallow in generalities.","tags":"articles","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Mar/13/how-to-dodge-the-consequences-of-belief/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Mar/13/how-to-dodge-the-consequences-of-belief/"},{"title":"A Foreshadowing of the End of the World?","text":"From time to time we see a headline like The end of the world IS nigh: Huge asteroid 'will hit earth in 2032' claim astronomers or a more modest one from this week's close-shave, Asteroid to hurtle past the Earth at 27,000 mph , and you are reminded of the random dangers that exist for us fragile creatures on this planet. I do have to grin whenever I hear the term \"end of the world\" (not used in the second article), because the end of the world will pretty much only happen when our Sun possibly consumes it in 5 billion years - the world is a big rock and hard to get rid of. What is intended in such phrases, of course, is the end of our lives on this world, which will happen at some point almost certainly much much sooner than that. Whenever I see headlines about rocks flying close by, I go over to the Near Earth Objects site and look at the close approaches. This week's particular rock, labeled 2000 EM26 , will pass within 9 lunar distances which is pretty close on the solar system scale. It is educational, and fun, to read about these sorts of dangers . From the chart below, this week's rock, if it were to strike, would deliver well over 100 megatons of TNT of energy, much larger than our largest nuclear bombs. Yikes! Luckily, this is unlikely to happen - for this rock. However, it is likely to happen at some point. I'm not sure if that makes for an optimistic or pessimistic message, but I'll let you decide.

Astrology is scientific sort of scientific not at all scientific …more than half think astrology is either \"scientific\" or \"sort of scientific\" . At first I was dismayed, but then when I thought about it, I honestly wasn't sure what to answer. My immediate impulse was to shy away from the \"not at all\" designation - that wording seemed too strong for anything in science. Then, upon further reflection, I realized that what I didn't like was actually the term \"scientific\" , in this context. What does it mean exactly? Is it really just a synonym for \"supported by the evidence\" ? If so, then the \"not at all supported by the evidence\" would indeed be too strong - there is at least some evidence for astrology, albeit so meager and terrible that no one should be convinced or take it seriously. I have a similar response to the hyperbolic statement that \"there is no evidence for god\" . It's not that there is no evidence, it's simply that the evidence is not convincing. Thinking further, I wondered can a topic be scientific or not scientific, when science really refers to a process ? Is the spontaneous generation of life not scientific? It can be investigated, and shown to be both unlikely and unnecessary to explain the data, but does that make it unscientific ? Or is it just that believing in it strongly, despite the evidence, is unscientific - in which case it is really the process that is being labeled unscientific. Not proportioning ones belief to the strength of the evidence is unscientific (and by definition irrational). Not following the processes of science is unskeptical and unscientific, but the topic itself cannot be \"scientific\" or \"not scientific\" . Perhaps a topic could be not scientific if it is untestable , like deism. However, astrology does not fall into that category either. In fact one student, when I implemented the survey in class, later admitted that they voted for \"scientific\" because of the detailed tests that could be done for astrology. So if you are testing the claims of astrology, and following scientific procedures, does that make astrology scientific or not? Does it even make \"scientific\" a coherent label for a topic of inquiry? I don't think so. I think the term scientific must refer to a process, not a subject. Perhaps a better wording would be 'well supported by the data', 'not well supported by the data', and 'barely to not at all supported by the data'. Where it says data here, replace with evidence if that reads better. I'm no expert on survey wording, but this one must be improved, I believe.","tags":"articles","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Feb/26/is-astrology-scientific/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Feb/26/is-astrology-scientific/"},{"title":"Scientific Knowledge","text":"In a comment on my Wordpress site (a site I am replacing with this one) on a post about \" Creationist Math \", the commenter says: I believe we all choose to have faith in one book or another. This is simply, and demonstrably, not true. First, faith is the belief in things without sufficient evidence - once you have evidence, it no longer is faith. Second, scientists don't simply take a \"book\" as an authority - on anything. The only authority is Nature herself, if you permit me a bit of anthropomorphic imagery there. Any idea is entertained, and then tested against what reality is. In no way would a scientist, performing science, simply \"have faith in one book or another\". Who knows what part of our \"scientific knowledge\" people are going to make fun of a few generations from now as we do from generations that came before? So, I was thinking about this, and was trying to come up with a list of things that were once felt to be known by scientists and yet we make fun of now. Pretty much the only examples I could come up with are things like the following: the glib use of radioactivity, when we first started to use radioactivity for things (e.g. sizing shoes with x-rays) the frequent use of antibiotics, when we first started to use antibiotics regularly phlogiston theory , when we were working out the theory of thermodynamics Perhaps I am missing some really good examples. In each case I could think of, however, the common theme was a field that was either new or highly uncertain (like much of medicine). So, on the fringes of science, we can look back and point to many things that were wrong or where the scientists were unjustifiably confident. However, we have other things like: Newton's theory of gravity Theory of optics Atomic theory Evolution theory all of which have withstood more than 100 years of scrutiny, and although some of the initial details have been shown to be incomplete, they haven't been substantially modified for a long time, and they aren't about to change ever . 10,000 years from now, Newton's laws will still be the best description of the mid-world (not too small, not too big and fast). After a quick example about the preservation of bones, the commenter ended with this: I'm sure there's a way to explain this issue logically, and as you say – us religious have a biased perspective and we make up our numbers… I agree… I also believe that ironically you do the same thing. Why don't we just agree that we both have faith in our perspectives? An admission that creationists \"make up their numbers\" is a pretty bold admission! I would want to see evidence that I \"ironically\" do the same thing. At what point have I \"made up numbers\"? The point of my post was that if you spin out the consequences of the claims of creationists, they lead to ridiculous results, or fly in the face of the data itself. This is how we dismantle false ideas, to leave the true ones. If there is a specific claim you want me to evaluate, let me know! If you can demonstrate convincingly that something I have claimed is incorrect, I would celebrate! It's a win-win for me - I learn something new, and I will then believe one fewer wrong thing in life. So, no, I will not agree that we both have \"faith\", or confidence in our positions without evidence. If you show me the evidence, I'll change my mind, of course.","tags":"articles","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Feb/12/scientific-knowledge/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Feb/12/scientific-knowledge/"},{"title":"Creationism Laid Bare","text":"Seems as if everyone is talking about the recent Ken Ham vs Bill Nye debate on evolution and creation, so I figured I'd put in my two cents. I couldn't help but notice the use of the word \"proof\" in this debate especially by Ken Ham. After reading my post about proof , can one really maintain that my distinction between \"proof\" and \"evidence\" is \"splitting hairs\", as one commenter put it? Said another way, when Ken Ham says \"You can't prove the world is 5 billion years old, you weren't there\", is this not obviously a word-game? The debate was not as bad as I thought it would be. Ken Ham did not do a Gish Gallop , much to my relief. I think it may encourage other scientists to deal with this problem of creationism, although I do recognize the strength in the argument that \"debates\" on topics that are not in debate in the scientific community can give credence to the pseudoscience. I have no experience in debate, so take my criticisms with a grain of salt, especially given that I think Nye did quite a good job. I thought it was great that Nye used CSI to point out there is no difference between Ham's so-called \"observational science\" and \"historical science\". I think he could have gone a lot further and pointed out that parallel at every point. For example, what if one of the investigators brought out a 100 year old book that claimed that the butler did it? What would the other investigators say, and why? What if the first investigator said that he was starting with the position that the 100 year old book was absolutely true, and that nothing could sway him from that position? Placed in a more familiar setting, Ken Ham's position is seen to be ridiculous. Essentially we have a difference of methodology that needs to be highlighted, and one could use CSI examples to really accentuate that difference. To bring out the nature of evidence in assessing claims, even in the past, and lay bare this distinction that Ham likes between observational and historical one can simply explore the question (in an entertaining way, as only Nye can do) which forms the basis for all of scientific thought: You have two people claiming different things, how do we distinguish between what is true and what is not? When Ham kept saying \"You can't prove the world is 5 billion years old, you weren't there\", I would have first reminded everyone of the distinction between evidence and proof. More importantly I would also point out that the entire premise of shows like CSI is that the investigators were not there and yet can establish to a high confidence what happened! Essentially, using Ham's argument, every CSI episode would have to end \"you can't know, you weren't there!\" Although I'm a bit more partial to Columbo, it is the case in all of these sorts of shows that different hypotheses about \"who done it\" lead to different conclusions. Often they point in the same direction on some observations, like the two hypotheses \"the butler did it\" and the \"the cook did it\" are consistent with the observation that the victim seemed to know the person attacking them. But they also predict different possible observations, such as footprints, or tracks left in the hall. Ham claimed that the global flood could lay down fossil beds. Nye countered with \"why did no mammal happen to sink down to the level of the dinosaurs (of the same size?\", and \"why do we see no evidence of kangaroos between the Middle East and Australia?\". These are exactly right, and one can drive this home again and again. Pointing out the cherry-picking of the creationist is essential! Ham made a big deal about the assumptions of radiometric dating. A quick comment about how one can establish the confidence in these methods by calibrating with known processes (e.g. tree rings, sediment layering) would have been nice. When this is done, it is amazing that all of these independent processes lead to the same estimates of age , within the uncertainties. The creationist would have us believe that this is just a coincidence! Finally, there were I think two statements by Ham that I found refreshing. He flatly admitted that he was starting with Biblical inerrancy, and working from there. He also flatly admitted that no evidence would sway him from that position. Those two statements really do lay the creationist agenda bare.","tags":"articles","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Feb/06/creationism-laid-bare/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Feb/06/creationism-laid-bare/"},{"title":"Anyone using the term \"scientific proof\" doesn't know science","text":"In my introduction to probability in class this week, I was asked if proof and evidence really meant the same thing. They don't. To summarize, Proof does not exist in science, only in math an philosophy. The only place you can have proof is where you have axioms (i.e. unprovable assertions), and can then prove a number of consequences of those axioms. We can prove, for example, that the sum of the angles of a triangle is 180 degrees, if we start with the Euclidean axioms of geometry. Science doesn't have axioms, and thus there are no proofs - there is only evidence. We sometimes hear the term \"proven scientifically\", even from people who should know better (like Richard Carrier in his \"Is Philosophy Stupid\" talk , his books , and his articles ). Other treatments of this topic can be found on the RationalWiki and on talkorigins . The mapping to probability theory is quite easy: proofs involve probabilities which are either \\(P=1\\) or \\(P=0\\) . Another way of putting it is, All of the evidence in the world cannot bring the probability of a scientific claim to certainty. To see this with probability theory, imagine we have two hypotheses for the Earth - flat earth and round earth. We can write Bayes' Rule for the probability of each given the data. Note that this data includes things like the experience of airplane flight, Magellan's trip, pictures from space - all of which could be faked! The flat earth hypothesis is not logically impossible. \\begin{eqnarray} P({\\rm round}|{\\rm data}) &=& \\frac{P({\\rm data}|{\\rm round})P({\\rm round})}{P({\\rm data}|{\\rm flat})P({\\rm flat})+P({\\rm data}|{\\rm round})P({\\rm round})}\\\\\\\\ P({\\rm flat}|{\\rm data}) &=& \\frac{P({\\rm data}|{\\rm flat})P({\\rm flat})}{P({\\rm data}|{\\rm flat})P({\\rm flat})+P({\\rm data}|{\\rm round})P({\\rm round})} \\end{eqnarray} Notice that, no matter how well the round earth hypothesis explains the data, $$P({\\rm data}|{\\rm round})\\approx 1$$ and how unlikely you believe it is that the Earth is flat even before the data (a far too strong of an anti-flat Earth bias than is actually warranted), $$P({\\rm flat})\\ll 1$$ as long as there is some possible (even if seriously contrived) way to explain the data with the flat earth hypothesis, $$P({\\rm data}|{\\rm flat}) \\neq 0$$ it is mathematically impossible to make the round earth hypothesis certain, $$P({\\rm round}|{\\rm data})\\le 1$$ On the right-hand side of Bayes' Rule, the larger the round-earth terms and the flat-earth terms get to 1 and 0, respectively, the closer the left-hand terms get to 1 and 0, but they never equal 1 and 0. This does not mean that we can't be confident of claims, only that we cannot have absolute certainty of anything in science (and therefore, in life in general). Anyone who doesn't understand that does not understand science.","tags":"articles","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Jan/31/anyone-using-the-term-scientific-proof-doesnt-know-science/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Jan/31/anyone-using-the-term-scientific-proof-doesnt-know-science/"},{"title":"Did Christians steal Christmas? - 22 December 2007","text":"As part of the Unbelievable Project , I am taking notes and \"arm-chair\" responding to each of the Unbelievable podcast episodes satisfying a set of simple rules .

Keep in mind that the earliest Gospel (i.e. Mark) and the earliest Christian writings (i.e. Paul) don't mention the Nativity.{.atheist} Doug - Some of these Pagan myths were written after the Gospels, some of them had many stories and weren't coherent. \"Where is the evidence that Matthew and Mark borrowed from them?\" Luke actually claims to be using eye witnesses. Why would he suddenly bring in myth and legend? {.theist} A very quick answer to the last one is that Luke claims to be bringing in using eye witnesses, which could easily be to make his account seem more credible. It certainly works for Christian apologists!{.me} Doug - Either it all came from legend or none of it came from legend. The virgin birth is not an isolated, incoherent event in the story. It is tied to his life work, to the Resurrection, etc... There is no legend that has all of these components. {.theist} That's a very silly argument, because even Paul doesn't include any of these components - he doesn't mention the virgin birth, or kings, or censuses. He doesn't mention Resurrection stories , only appearances . The Iliad and Odyssey both include real places, even if much of the story is legend and myth. {.me} Robert - \"How do you establish the virgin birth from eyewitnesses?\" You can't! Luke didn't have to be making things up, he could simply be writing what other people told him, which he believed. {.atheist} Robert - Most people don't think that Adam and Eve really existed, because then you run into problems with archaeology, cosmology, etc... yet Luke has a genealogy of Jesus that goes back to Adam. You then have to take the Adam and Eve story seriously if you want to take the Luke story seriously. {.atheist} Robert - People should be under no illusions that what they are doing is simply \"picking and mixing\" in the Bible. {.atheist} I entirely agree here, and I really like the idea of tying Luke's genealogy to the story of Adam, because it makes clear one of the (many) reasons we don't trust these sources. As for \"picking and mixing\", it was Matt Dillahunty who said that \"the Bible is a giant book of multiple choice\". You can read out of it any message that you want to, because it contains either contradictory statements, or statements that can be read either way. You agree with slavery? There are verses for that! You are opposed to slavery? There are verses for that!{.me} Doug - Comments on the so-called mistranslation of virgin by Matthew, pointing out that the Greek word for maiden already was being used in the context of virgin at Matthew's time, and thus is not a mistranslation as is typically claimed by atheists.{.theist} I believe this is correct, also stated by Robert Price . It is one of the cases of a traditional atheist argument that is unfounded when you look at the data.{.me} Doug - Where is the evidence that these stories either are legends or are borrowed from legends? Just because they may be similar, does not mean that they are in fact legends or borrowed from those legends.{.theist} Robert - The burden of proof lies with the one making the extraordinary claim (e.g. virgin birth, star of Bethlehem, etc...), like claims for unicorns.{.atheist} Doug - If you didn't have the \"naturalistic presupposition\" against miracles, you wouldn't be so skeptical.{.theist} This canard really gets my goat. As Robert Price says, you don't have to believe miracles to be impossible to not believe that every miracle claim is true. Miracles, by their nature, must be rare so one would need particularly good evidence for one, even if you believe they are possible . There are no contemporary accounts of any of the events related in the nativity story, from the star, to the slaughter of the innocents, to the three kings, to the particulars of the census. Even if there was a miracle, this is not convincing evidence for it.{.me}","tags":"Unbelievable Project","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Jan/29/did-christians-steal-christmas-22-december-2007/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Jan/29/did-christians-steal-christmas-22-december-2007/"},{"title":"Unbelievable Project: Did Jesus Exist?

Bart Ehrman Q&A In this one-on-one edition of the show, Justin Brierley speaks to New Testament Historian Bart Ehrman about his recent book \"Did Jesus Exist?\" which argues for the historical fact of Jesus of Nazareth. Ehrman, whose books are more usually at odds with evangelicals, was this time attacked by atheist proponents of \"mythicism\" - the view that Jesus never existed. He responds to the criticisms, including mythicists Bob Price and Richard Carrier and answers questions sent in by Unbelievable? listeners.

Justin Brierley - Christian Moderator Bart Ehrman - Atheist Notes This episode doesn't have a theist , just the moderator. Bart - [around 13:50] Carrier's review of my work is \"vitriolic\" and not carried out in a \"scholarly mode\" . Saying things like \"this book is crap is not scholarly discourse.\" . \"People who are truly interested in the historical issues don't write like this.\" {.atheist} I would have to agree with Bart Ehrman in this case. I truly wish that people who have good points to make don't undermine it with juvenile behavior. However, I don't agree that Bart makes a strong case for the existence of the historical Jesus. Part of this is that I am not strongly convinced by historical arguments. I can see that a reasonable person could support a belief in a historical Jesus, but I can't see that a strong case can be made. The counter arguments, by Carrier and Price primarily, seem convincing to me to the point that I am really agnostic about the existence of a historical Jesus. As Robert Price says, the historical Jesus if he existed is forever lost behind the stained-glass curtain of legend.{.me} Bart - So a typical sort of argument from Carrier makes in his review is the \"Pilot\" error, dealing with a very minor point which has nothing to do with the issue. Richard Carrier didn't mount any positive arguments that Jesus didn't exist, and only attacked Ehrman's scholarship.{.atheist} Bart - [around 24:40] Bart has an appeal to authority, claiming that Bob Price's opinion is not shared by virtually all mainstream scholars.{.atheist} I have found that people lean on the consensus too much, especially apologists and Bart Ehrman. Bob Price has gone on the record as saying that he doesn't care about the consensus, and just treats each case as it comes. In Price's words, \"truth isn't decided by a nose count.\" A small note about consistency - sometimes I refer to Robert Price, Bob Price, or Robert M Price. I've heard each of these used, even in this single episode, so please forgive my inconsistent use. {.me} Bart - [around 28:30] Bart introduces the \" criterion of embarrassment \" for the crucifixion, citing Bob Price's response that there are popular novels from the second century and hero stories like Spartacus where their hero is crucified or tortured, but escapes. Thus, according to Bob Price, this sort of story was not embarrassing, but part of the literature already. Bart retorts that he \"doesn't know what Bob is talking about, and further, Bob doesn't know what he is talking about either\" in terms of novels. We have 5 Greek novels from the ancient world, and there are no characters in any of them who are crucified and then escape. He adds that the problem isn't that a hero gets crucified but a Messiah gets crucified. We don't have any record of any Jew prior to Christianity saying that the Messiah would get crucified. {.atheist} To me, this isn't a problem. We have the same sort of thing in UFO cults and even in the Jehovah's Witnesses - the group expects something (e.g. rapture or getting beamed up) on a particular day. That day comes, nothing happens, and they rework the expectation. As for the Greek novels, I will have to check this. I am not familiar with the extent of the literature of the time. {.me} Bart - challenges Bob Price to give a reference to any Jew mentioning Osiris within 200 years of Jesus. He then highlights the differences, such as Osiris staying dead, with the soul going to the underworld but the body not coming back to life.{.atheist} From my understanding of both Bob Price and Richard Carrier, the claim isn't that the Jews consciously borrowed from the Osiris myth, but that it was part of the gestalt, with syncretism being a common process, and that one wouldn't expect a direct mention. Further, Bart is assuming that the pre-Gospel tradition (i.e. Paul) referred to a bodily resurrection - I'm not convinced this is the case.{.me} Bart - considering the idea that the entire Testimonium Flavianum in Josephus is a forgery, he essentially says that if you take out the Christian bits, the rest of it reads like Josephus, has the style of Josephus, so it is likely to be Josephus. Also, if Christians had made up a passage, it would have been much longer and flowery.{.atheist} I am not convinced at all by this. The passage right before the Testimonium and right after flow smoothly into each other, the passage does not appear in an otherwise complete table of contents, and there is no mention of the passage by Church fathers (such as Origen) who had every opportunity and desire to quote such a thing. Finally, perhaps the forger would know that if the language was too flowery it would be called out as a fraud. To me, trying to guess the language that might be used if the situation were different is not a strong foundation upon which to build an argument. {.me}","tags":"Unbelievable Project","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Jan/25/unbelievable-project-did-jesus-exist-bart-ehrman-qa-18-august-2012/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Jan/25/unbelievable-project-did-jesus-exist-bart-ehrman-qa-18-august-2012/"},{"title":"Properly Basic Obscurantism","text":"I was listening to a debate about the irrationality of theism , and the theist, Randall Rauser introduced me to a concept in philosophy that I had not heard of: properly basic beliefs. Rauser defines rationality in the following way: Positively, a rational belief is any belief that is either properly non-basic or properly basic. A properly non-basic belief is a belief that is held appropriately in light of supporting evidence. A properly basic belief is a belief that is held appropriately but which does not require evidence. It seems as if, with this definition, properly basic beliefs are equivalent in function to axioms in mathematics. Fair enough. Examples Rauser and others have used for properly basic beliefs include: Your friend Joe says he ate cornflakes this morning. The testimony of your wife saying that it is raining outside where she is. Jesus rose from the dead. A banana is in front of me, because I see it. 2+2=4. Now I am no philosopher (or perhaps I am, depending on whom you ask ). That being said, I don't find the concept of \"properly basic belief\" to be at all clarifying, when we have words like axioms. But, for the sake of charity, I will consider the axioms of math to be properly basic for much of this post. I think, however, that even something as basic as \"2+2=4\" is an empirical relationship. If the rules of the universe were such that sometimes \"2+2=5\", then we'd have a different math, and thus the rules of math are really tied to the rules of the universe. However, I could imagine someone successfully arguing that the basic laws of math are \"properly basic\" in the sense that Rauser would want - rationally held without requiring evidence. But aside from that, I don't think that any of the other cases are properly basic in this way, especially testimony of any kind. Rauser will say thing like, belief in the testimony of your wife is a properly basic belief because you don't need to go check it out further, get documentary evidence and video evidence to verify it, but you can still believe it rationally. I would agree with all of that, but that doesn't make it properly basic. You don't need to get more evidence, but that doesn't imply that you are accepting it without evidence. You have the evidence of your entire experience with your wife, as a trustworthy person. How do you know she's trustworthy? Empirically! You also have the experience, in general, that even typically untrustworthy people don't tend to be untrustworthy about mundane claims. When you assess the probability that it is truly raining, given your wife's testimony, you are really doing that with a lot of other empirical evidence that you have built up over your life. It is easy to see this is the case, because changing the context can completely change whether you are rational to accept the testimony. Let's say that your wife is in Antarctica. Surely it would not be rational to accept her testimony, and more rational to think she is joking, exaggerating, or mistaken. The same testimony, with a different background experience, yields different probability assignments and thus a different strength of belief in the claim. Thus, the testimony alone cannot be a properly basic belief. You can follow this line of argument for the cornflakes example as well. The reason we do not simply trust the testimony of others on resurrection claims is the same reason we wouldn't trust the claim of rain in Antarctica - especially because rain in Antarctica is more likely than a resurrection. We have established, empirically, when testimony can be trusted (not at 100 percent ever!), and when it can't. We've established certain patterns that occur when testimony is wrong, and those patterns exist in the Biblical claims. We've established historical patterns, the process of information transmission, the influence of political entities, the scientific workings of the universe, etc... All of this comes into play when establishing the probability of the resurrection. If we take the axioms of mathematics to be \"properly basic\", then the probability calculus follows from that, which includes the proper procedures for updating states of knowledge given evidence. All other claims must be based on evidence to be rational, and thus cannot be \"properly basic\", or axiomatic. Want to challenge the axioms of math? Good luck with that! If we agree to take the axioms of math as \"properly basic\", then all we need to say is: Axioms [of math] are statements we believe rationally with no evidence. All other things need to be believed only with sufficient evidence, and the strength of the belief should scale with the evidence. It is simply a consequence of the math, probability theory in this case. You'll note that the entire term \"properly basic\" has disappeared, and introducing it would only muddy the discussion, making things less clear than a straightforward application of probability theory. One final thought. I get the feeling, and I doubt I could ever demonstrate this convincingly, that the only reason someone would suggest that God, or the resurrection, are \"properly basic\" is because there is so little evidence for these claims yet the proponents do not want to admit that they are being irrational, so the only choice is to dispense with evidence for rational belief altogether. It smacks of a desperate move, but perhaps it is just an example of Shermer's \" smart people believing weird things \", where they are smart about rationalizing things they came to believe for non-smart reasons. In either case, I believe it is important to stick to well-established mathematical vocabulary when discussing the basis for beliefs, and not introduce vocabulary that is unnecessary and, as a consequence, unclear.","tags":"articles","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Jan/24/properly-basic-obscurantism/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Jan/24/properly-basic-obscurantism/"},{"title":"Physics and the Flash Mind Reader","text":"While preparing for physics class, I found this gem: the Flash Mind Reader ! So, here is a simple website which claims to read your mind. This is a pretty extraordinary claim, so I would want extraordinary evidence. It's a nice exercise in evaluating claims. First, we ask, does it do what it specifically claims to do, regardless of interpretation? . On the site, it asks you to think of a two-digit number, then do some basic math on it to get another number, which you then look up on a table. The table associates the final number with a symbol, and it is that symbol which the \"Mind Reader\" determines. So regardless of whether the interpretation is a psychic process, or some mundane process, does the process work as claimed? In many extraordinary claims of this sort, the claimant fails even at this preliminary step. This is well documented at the JREF Challenge site. However, in the case of the Flash Mind Reader , the process does seem to work! Okay, then the next step kicks in. How many ways can we think of this thing to work, and can we test them? Is it overly skeptical to not consider mind-reading in that list? I don't think so, but we could probably come up with some tests even there. For example, would it work done on a group of people all at once? If it did, that would certainly count against mind reading. Here are a few ways that I initially thought it could work, and I could quickly discount them by looking at the table, or trying it a few times. does the calculation lead to the same number each time? No! is it the same symbol each time you run it? No! do all the numbers have the same symbol? No! With a little imagination, one can come up with a probable explanation that does not involve telepathy, but it is a nice recreation of the way a scientist would address any claim, extraordinary or not.","tags":"articles","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Jan/22/physics-and-the-flash-mind-reader/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Jan/22/physics-and-the-flash-mind-reader/"},{"title":"Philosophy and Science - What's the Difference?","text":"In a discussion on The Limits Of Science with Lawrence Krass, Dan Dennett, and Massimo Pigliucci, there is much haggling over the relationship between science and philosophy. Although I think they all \"got it\" in the end, it would have been much more direct if they adopted my definition of philosophy (and they didn't consult me?). If you go back and listen to the debate, keeping the definition below in mind, one can see where each of them is correct even when it seems as if they are contradicting themselves. The definition of philosophy is the following: Philosophy Philosophy is science without data. What that definition does is it makes sense of Pigliucci's claim that \"philosophy is about clarifying questions\" , but it also makes sense of Krauss' claim that \"philosophy doesn't benefit working scientists \" (in physics, he adds). The result of the definition is that now we can see a continuum between philosophy and science, dictated by the amount of data, or possibly the quality of the data. So when Dennett says that philosophy is important in neuroscience and cognitive science, what he's saying is that the level of data in those fields is at such an undeveloped level that philosophy is needed to help frame the questions. This is simply an admission that these fields are in their infancy. I'm not entirely sure whether philosophers would particularly like this way of phrasing, but it does seem to make sense of a lot of the confusion which typically surrounds these discussions.","tags":"articles","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Jan/21/philosophy-and-science-whats-the-difference/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Jan/21/philosophy-and-science-whats-the-difference/"},{"title":"Chess, Morality, and Well-Being","text":"In a discussion on The Limits Of Science with Lawrence Krass, Dan Dennett, and Massimo Pigliucci, Dan Dennett makes an analogy with chess (and its rules) to morality. The analogy goes something like this. He says the game of chess has been improved over time. Things like the addition of the castling rule, things like the en passant rule, and so on have improved the game. These are done because people like to have a fast-moving game, or one that doesn't take forever. He then said something like, if you had two groups of people that disagreed about the different rules of the game, each thinking a different set of rules was superior and if one side couldn't convince the other of their perspective, then there really wasn't a \"right answer\". He implied that there would be a right answer if one group could convince the other one of the superiority of their side, and he thought that this was like morality. However I think, if you take Sam Harris' perspective on morality as I typically do, you notice that even for Dennett there is a reason why different versions of chess would be better, and it doesn't come up for a vote. People prefer certain types of games and this leads to an increase in the well-being of those people that play them. Certain rule changes would be better because some changes would lead to longer games, or more difficult games, and thus decrease overall well-being. It becomes an objective fact about human consciousness and games. Both in the area of morality, and in this analogy, there would be right and wrong answers to those questions based on the well-being of people. Dennett's analogy might be closer than he thinks, but not in the way he intends.","tags":"articles","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Jan/17/chess-morality-and-well-being/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Jan/17/chess-morality-and-well-being/"},{"title":"The Cover Art for Statistical Inference for Everyone (sie)","text":"The cover art for my book, Statistical Inference for Everyone , is something created by me and I'd like to explain my design.

Robert Barron, to start off the new year. [youtube=http://www.youtube.com /watch?v=1zMf_8hkCdc&w=560&h=315] Here is the summary: He starts by referring to what \"serious theists\" think about the word \"God. Points out that many use the word very differently, calling attention to differences between the usage by atheists and those by \"serious\" theists He talks about the \"genus of being\", and that atheists believe that God is the supreme instance of that...but that is exactly what God is not...according to Aquinas, God is not a being, a thing, or individual He is the \"subsistent act of to-be itself\", the \"great ocean of existence from which the world in its entirety comes\" he contrasts this with gods, which are the supreme existence of being, and exist within nature...God does not exist within Nature \"The sciences in principle cannot eliminate God, because God is not an item within the natural world. God is not some event or phenomenon which can be examined by the physical sciences.\" He claims that you don't produce evidence for the creator of the universe, like you would for Yeti...this is a category error. \"authentic religion\" begins with the extraordinary experience of the contingency of the world - the deep intuition that the world exists by doesn't have to exist. \"We know there is some reality whose very nature is 'to be' - that infinite source of reality that grounds and gives rise to the whole nexus of conditioned things...in you we live and move and have our being...that's God.\" He ends with criticizing atheists for suggesting that the universe pops out of nothing, and accusing theists of magical thinking. He accuses atheists of dropping the question (claiming \"I don't know\") when the question gets really interesting - why is there something rather than nothing. I have a number of responses to parts of this: He claims that Aquinas is particularly clear, and then quotes Aquinas as saying that God is the \"subsistent act of to-be itself\" amongst other things. Sorry, that's word soup, and doesn't mean anything. He is correct that science cannot disprove such a nebulous definition of God. If everyone simply took this definition, and went no further, they'd be deists. If every religious person became a deists, the atheists would have no work to do. The problem is that religious people do not stop with deism. If God isn't a \"being\", then what does it mean for God to speak to people? What does it mean for God to be three persons? What does it mean for God to intercede in the world? A personal God? I think this guy believes, when convenient, in nebulous deism and, when convenient, medieval and Bronze age superstition. \"We know there is some reality whose very nature is 'to be' - that infinite source of reality that grounds and gives rise to the whole nexus of conditioned things...in you we live and move and have our being...that's God.\" - Notice how easily he moves from nearly content-free deepity speak, and then slides in \"...in you...\" implying a mind, a person, a relationship. This is the jump where he is claiming to know things he cannot know. I'd further add that the entire claim in the previous point is something he cannot know. He refers to philosophical intuition of the contingency of everything (including the universe) but has not demonstrated it to be true. Until then, \"I don't know\" is the proper response. The only reason anyone speaks like this at all is because religion has lost its authority on nearly every level (medicine, history, astronomy, physics, biology, etc...), so that no one can take the stories seriously anymore. Just because something lies outside of nature, if it affects nature at all it can be tested. This has been done with \"miracle\" claims (healings, visions, resurrections, etc...), efficacy of prayer, and models of the cosmos - and they have been all shown to be wanting. Thus, it reduces the probability of this interventionist God claim. If you want to retreat to a non-interventionist God, in principle immune from science, no problem...but stop claiming that that is somehow a victory.","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Jan/06/a-new-year-and-a-deepity/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2014/Jan/06/a-new-year-and-a-deepity/"},{"title":"Religion and the Illusion of Moral Authority","text":"This post in response to a comment I received about the source of morality in society : But I realize religion, even with its negatives, remains a net positive in human endeavors because it supplies something that cannot be supplied by any other…a body of moral precepts that humans can rally around and use to guide behavior in society. I don't believe this, and neither do most people if they thought about it for a little while. On a practical level, how do we figure out what is good and what is bad? Let's focus just on the Christian message, which is informed from the moral statements in the Bible. This includes things like the Golden Rule, the Sermon on the Mount, and the Ten Commandments...or does it? Here are a few quotes from the Bible, both Old and New Testament, and I ask which ones are good and bad, and how do you know?: Deuteronomy 22:20-1 If, however, the charge is true and no proof of the girl's virginity can be found, she shall be brought to the door of her father's house and there the men of her town shall stone her to death. Deuteronomy 20: However, in the cities of the nations the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance, do not leave alive anything that breathes. Exodus 21:20-21 If a man beats his male or female slave with a rod and the slave dies as a direct result, he must be punished, but he is not to be punished if the slave gets up after a day or two, since the slave is his property. 1 Peter 2:18 Slaves, submit yourselves to your masters with all respect, not only to those who are good and considerate, but also to those who are harsh. Matthew 5: 31 \"It has been said, ‘Anyone who divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce.' But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, makes her the victim of adultery, and anyone who marries a divorced woman commits adultery. Leviticus 24:16 \"And he that blasphemeth the name of the Lord, he shall surely be put to death\" - penalty for breaking one of the ten commandments Matthew 12:32 \"Whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come\". Now, I am not making any claims here that any of these are good or bad (although personally, I do have opinions on them). What I am saying is that people look at some of these and say they are bad, some are just fine, but whatever reason people use, they aren't using the religion as the authority to decide . That's the point. People already pick and choose messages from the Bible, taking some of the more unpleasant things as anachronistic or metaphorical, other unpleasant things as exaggerations, and keeping the seemingly good things. In all of this, the religion isn't the thing giving them guidance in their moral decisions. The religion is simply giving a vocabulary to summarize the moral perspective someone has for non-religious reasons, in much the same way that the Robert Frost poem \"The Road Not Taken\" summarizes the feeling many have of being better choosing a more difficult path in life. However, we come to that feeling for \"non-Frostian\" reasons. It could even be said that for some, reading the Frost poem motivates them to see value in a difficult decision. However, there is something \"non-Frostian\" motivating the decision to draw inspiration from this poem, and not another one. We can take our moral messages from many sources, and in practice we do that. Although many people claim that religion gives us our morality, or moral guidance, in reality it does nothing of the sort.","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Dec/18/religion-and-the-illusion-of-moral-authority/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Dec/18/religion-and-the-illusion-of-moral-authority/"},{"title":"A story of humanity...","text":"Carolyn Porco always finds a way to inspire...

We do not confess three Gods, but one God in three persons, the \"consubstantial Trinity\".83 The divine persons do not share the one divinity among themselves but each of them is God whole and entire: \"The Father is that which the Son is, the Son that which the Father is, the Father and the Son that which the Holy Spirit is, i.e. by nature one God.\"84 In the words of the Fourth Lateran Council (1215), \"Each of the persons is that supreme reality, viz., the divine substance, essence or nature.\"85 254 The divine persons are really distinct from one another. \"God is one but not solitary.\"86 \"Father\", \"Son\", \"Holy Spirit\" are not simply names designating modalities of the divine being, for they are really distinct from one another: \"He is not the Father who is the Son, nor is the Son he who is the Father, nor is the Holy Spirit he who is the Father or the Son.\"87 They are distinct from one another in their relations of origin: \"It is the Father who generates, the Son who is begotten, and the Holy Spirit who proceeds.\"88 The divine Unity is Triune. This is what I hear: \\begin{eqnarray} a&=&b=c\\\\\\\\ a&\\neq& b\\\\\\\\ a&\\neq& c\\\\\\\\ c&\\neq& b \\end{eqnarray} And then when I hear a Christian say something like this, which was on the Unbelievable Facebook forum, We [...] stress the Trinity a lot, not only because we think it is true but because it explains some things. For one thing, it means that the ideas of personal relationship and love are built into existence and have always been. For another it helps us understand how God can be completely transcendent (the Father) and yet reveal Himself to us (via the Word and Spirit). What I hear is: We [...] stress the X a lot, Not only do I think \\begin{eqnarray} a&=&b=c\\\\\\\\ a&\\neq& b\\\\\\\\ a&\\neq& c\\\\\\\\ c&\\neq& b \\end{eqnarray} is true, but it explains a number of things. For one thing, it means that $$ a+x=b+x $$ is built into the system. For another it helps us understand how $$ a-x\\\\neq b-x $$ and yet $$ b-x=c-x $$ So where am I going wrong here? Where does the analogy break? If you say that the Trinity is a \"mystery\", that is simply an admission that the Trinity is incoherent. If you say that I am not using the word \"is\" correctly, then please enlighten me as to the proper definition, but make sure it is well defined.","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Nov/19/the-trinity-and-coherency/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Nov/19/the-trinity-and-coherency/"},{"title":"Science as Entertainment","text":"This past weekend I was at a Girl Scouts \"Mad Science\" program, not as an instructor but as a parent. There was a lot of interesting things presented, and the girls all seemed to have a good time, but I constantly felt that there was little real science being done. I've had that feeling with some \"science\" shows on television, and this was another example of what I think of as \"Science as Entertainment\": lots of cool-wow eye candy, but little content. Now, I recognize there are some real constraints in doing programs like this, and I don't want to be negative, so I've been thinking of ways to improve a program like this. Some of the constraints are: you don't often have scientists running the individual activities, even if you might have a scientist organize it the people running the activities are either older girl scouts or parents who are scout leaders - thus, there needs to be a bit of a script to follow you need to have the eye-candy to keep some interest you have limited time Given these constraints, I'd offer this major suggestion: the activities should start with a small cool-wow demo, followed by a question like \"I wonder how this works?\" or \"I wonder what this is sensitive to?\". Then do a followup activity (or more) where one addresses these questions, always focussing on the \"how do we know what we know?\" overarching theme. That's what science is really about! Let me give some specific examples, taken from the activities actually done. Static Electricity Demo In this activity, the scouts did a number of observations of static, including rubbing balloons in the hair and picking up pepper, attracting ping-pong balls, and sticking the balloon to the wall. Although all cool, it would be good to start with one, and ask \"what's going on here?\" The example which was missing here is the repulsion from the charge, giving the impression that static is always attractive. All it would take is to put two balloons together (or try!) and see that they don't like each other...this leads to the two-charge model. One could even add/replace one of the activities with the scotch-tape version of the experiment, and then ask if the charge on the balloon is the same/different than the scotch tape. Making Bubbles So, the scouts made a bubble mixture from household ingredients (i.e. dish soap, corn syrup, etc...), took them outside and played with bubbles for a while. A good question would be \"which ingredient gives which property?\" With all the scouts there, throughout the morning, one could do a lot of trial and error, even make it a contest for the biggest bubble, the longest lasting bubble, etc... Does dish soap work alone? Does corn syrup work alone? Why do both work? One could tie this to a TV show like America's Test Kitchen , where they do tests like this all the time. Balance Here, there was a series of gravity-type experiments with free-fall, but then at the end they did an activity about balance: leaning against a wall with your right shoulder and head, and trying to lift your left leg. Again, the sorts of questions that one could follow with is \"why is it hard to lift your leg?\", \"under what conditions would this be true?\", \"could you come up with another pose that does something similar?\", etc... Personally, this would be a awesome place to do the energy bracelet demo ! Conclusions In each case, the point is to do a demo, ask some leading questions related to \"how do we know what we know\", and structure the activities to answer the questions. I would also add that the person overseeing the activities should be encouraged to say \"I don't know\", and to know that it is a perfectly fine answer. It should be followed up by a, \"I wonder how we could figure out\" statement. The danger in presenting science and anything that looks/sounds sciency without any content is is primes kids to accept the latest pseudoscience, just because it sounds technical. It also makes kids start thinking that science is just about the technicalities, and not about the general questions relating to knowledge and belief. Another danger is that several times I heard an \"explanation\" of what was going on in the activity that did not really match what was actually observed. I know this is from following a script, but it is very damaging. It gives kids the impression that one should believe in science authorities, even in the face of contrary evidence. It also increases confusion about what is actually happening. Cases like this should bring up the idea of repeatability, variability, and careful measurements. A response like this would be more appropriate: \"hmmm...that's odd, I don't know why it isn't working like I think it should...how can we figure this out?\" Even if there is no time, or equipment, to do the proper job it is still useful to outline how one could do it.","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Nov/12/science-as-entertainment/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Nov/12/science-as-entertainment/"},{"title":"Knowledge, Faith, and Belief","text":"Words have meaning, and if we are going to communicate with each other we need to make sure to use words as carefully as we can. Otherwise, misunderstandings abound. It seems very common that a word like \"faith\" is used by different people for different ends, and the definition shifts even within an argument. Take for example, this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UH8np-WBa_o Here there is a distinction drawn between \"faith\" and \"belief\", using an analogy of a roller-coaster - belief in the ride being safe vs trusting it being safe enough to ride on. As with many things, I find it far more useful to describe terms in probabilistic vocabulary. Let's start with belief. We say we believe a proposition A when P(A)>0.5. We say we believe strongly in a proposition A when P(A)>0.95 or some other, somewhat arbitrary, high number. The strength of a belief is a scale . What is knowledge? I've heard philosophers give the following definition of knowledge: Knowledge is justified true belief. [note: bad definition, IMO] I am not satisfied with this definition because, it seems to me that, in order to justifiably label anything as knowledge with this definition we'd need to be able to independently determine that the proposition is true. This presupposes that there is some \"outside\" knowledge, which I feel comes too close to assuming a religious justification. I do believe that there is probably a truth to be known, but that we can never truly know what it is for certain - but this is not a problem. It is a red herring to bring up 100% certainty for knowledge, because it is never achievable, and isn't what we practically call knowledge. I prefer a definition inspired by Stephen J Gould: In science, 'fact' can only mean 'confirmed to such a degree that it would be perverse to withhold provisional assent.' I suppose that apples might start to rise tomorrow, but the possibility does not merit equal time in physics classrooms. Where it says \"fact\", read \"knowledge\". Where it says \"science\" read \"life\". We label things as knowledge in our lives when they are \"confirmed to such a degree that it would be perverse to withhold provisional assent.\" Thus, P(A)>0.9999 \\~ 1 . Notice that we don't need 100% certainty to claim knowledge, and that it is possible for the \"knowledge\" to be wrong. What about faith? Is faith \"belief without evidence\", as atheists like to suggest? Is it \"trust\", as in the video above? We could start with the Biblical reference, Hebrews 11:1, \"Now faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see.\" [NIV] which I read as a synonym for \"wishful thinking\". Others may read it as \"trust\". Still others as \"belief without evidence\", and perhaps there are more. The problem here is that it doesn't have a clear definition, so it fails in its usefulness. What are people really claiming here? Let's go back to the roller-coaster example. I would submit that, in this case, strong belief must be a prerequisite to \"faith\" in the sense he's using it. If you don't believe the roller-coaster is safe, or you don't believe the roller-coaster exists, then you cannot have trust it in. Once you believe it is safe, do you trust it to ride? This brings in decision theory, where we mix probabilities with utility measures. You could believe it to be safe at the P( safe )=0.9 level, but still not trust it \"with your life\" because of the cost associated with being wrong. So trust requires both belief and a sufficiently positive net utility. Placed in these terms it is much more clear how the argument is set up. when the religious say that \"faith\" is like \"trust\", they are already approaching the problem with strong belief, and are assessing utility - and they rightly claim that belief is not enough. when the atheists say that \"faith\" is \"belief without evidence\", they are addressing the strength of the evidence to obtain strong belief - and saying that it is not sufficient. when the religious say that \"faith is rational\" they are either talking about utility, not belief, or they are claiming that the evidence is in fact good enough for strong belief, and then consequently high utility. In all cases, it seems as if for the religious, utility and belief are muddled when using the word \"faith\". For the atheist, \"faith\" is always about belief. Perhaps if we ditch the term \"faith\" altogether and focus on what we're actually claiming it would make communication a lot easier!","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Oct/24/knowledge-faith-and-belief/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Oct/24/knowledge-faith-and-belief/"},{"title":"Nobel Prize - The \"Higgs\" and Predictions","text":"So around 50 years ago a number of scientists made a prediction for an unseen particle (typically referred to as the 'Higgs boson' but also sometimes as the 'God particle' - a silly name if I ever heard one) which, if it existed, [helped to fill in an explanation of the fundamental laws of the universe][]. It took 50 years, thousands of people, and millions of dollars to directly confirm this prediction but it was done last year ...and thus is deserving of a Nobel Prize . The Nobel Prize can only be give to at most three scientists, so the letter-of-the-law committee omitted three other scientists who also contributed to this prediction. I had the fortune to take high energy physics with one of these, Prof Gerry Guralnik, at Brown University. To think that we, as a species, are able to predict something so subtle in the universe, decades before our ability to actually confirm it, is truly astounding.

After sitting in on several of these, I've come to find (at least for me) that they are the treadmill of education. I try to keep up a running schedule, which I've been able to do during the spring and summer, but have always fallen off the wagon in the winter. In the winter, the dark and the cold makes it hard to run outside and the academic schedule makes it hard to run during the daylight hours. I hope to overcome this, but it means running more on my treadmill (which I have). The difference between running outside and running on a treadmill is psychological - if you run a mile and don't feel up to the second mile you can get off the treadmill and go back upstairs for a break. The same thing happens with a MOOC. I've \"attended\" a few of these classes, but never really finished. This is due to time and motivation, because the classes generally were pretty good. However, given pressing time of things that I have to do, it is hard to push my way through assignments that I might like to do. In addition, I find it hard to find time to sit and watch a video, instead of reading or listening to audio books, seminars and podcasts which are all more convenient (at least for me).

There was a good question at the end where the moderator asked - what is a layperson to do, when they may not have the resources, knowledge, or time to be able to properly evaluate the position of the \"experts\". Craig's response, which was reasonable by incomplete, was to read the book reviews after reading a book by an expert, to see what the responses are. Krauss retorted that that was another appeal to authority, and added that when you read something, \"if it seems crazy, it probably is\". Krauss' response is ridiculous, and is especially bad given the field he is in - who doesn't think anything in modern science sounds crazy? So, what do I do? Mine is closer to Craig's, but I take it a step further. When I hear a claim, I try to find someone claiming the polar opposite. I then read each of their supporting arguments, and the refutations of the other sides. I look, then, for a specific claim that each side disagrees with, but can be easily checked - and I try to check it. This usually involves going back and forth between the two sides a bit, because of the qualifications to the arguments. Someone claims that the Bible condones slavery, another doesn't. I hear the quotes from each side, and the context, and then I go to the text to look at a couple of the passages - the ones I think are most critical. I may then go back to the arguments, to see if what they are saying matches what I read, etc... I also look at the style of the arguments. One of the reasons I switch from being a global warming alarmist to a luke-warmist was because of climateaudit.org . I could tell that they made a big deal about putting the data up, and turn-key scripts to do the analysis, so it was completely straightforward to check every step. I didn't need to check every step myself, but the effort to make things transparent was quite evident. If I see people dodging the meat of a challenge, or not being transparent, or engaging in special pleading, I need not have to evaluate the argument in quite so much detail to be reasonably convinced that there is a problem with it. I think the habit of examining the opposing view, even - and especially - when you agree with the original view is extremely important, and something that many do not do. They follow blogs that agree with them only, read newspapers that agree with their point of view, listen to podcasts that agree with them, etc...

The points he raises are: everyone has a moral code all cultures have essential monotheism (one main creator god, with lesser gods) and that humans are separated from the creator god no atheist cultures I haven't done the research to confirm point (2), so I'll accept it for the sake of argument. Points (1) and (3) I think are almost certainly true (there are some exceptions for point (1) - sociopaths). So what would an atheistic explanation for this data? ​1. The moral code is exactly what one would expect for social creatures, developed through a blind process of evolution. Social creatures, by definition, need to work together to survive. Thus, concepts such as fairness, supporting the weak members of the group, caring for others, etc... would be a direct consequence of this process. We'd also expect a conflict between biological drives for individual vs group survival, variation in the altruism of the members, and evidence of moral behavior in our nearest social species - all of which can be seen experimentally. If this code is something uniquely human, which the theists claim, then we shouldn't see it in other animals. ​2. Answering a question with a question: how many societies have there been without a hierarchical governing organization? It seems clear to me that the structure of monotheism matches pretty well the development of human cultures and the organization of those cultures. As they say on the Reasonable Doubts podcast , \"God thinks like you\". I'd also add that, unless you had a totally democratic pantheon, you'd end up with one \"most powerful\" god, and probably fall under Johnson's \"essential\" monotheism. In other words, the category of \"essential monotheism\" may include nearly every possibility. ​3. Atheism is not obvious, and we have a biological tendency to agency detection. In addition, science is hard. It takes work to be skeptical, against our many biases, etc... Finally, apparent design in biology is so obvious that without the theory of evolution, the belief in divine design is a completely reasonable position. Darwin did not disprove God, but he made it possible to be an intellectually consistent atheist. Personally, I think these responses are far more compelling than: ​1. God gave us a moral code (even with the inconsistencies between individuals, and the immoral actions condoned and commanded in the Bible) ​2. All cultures believe in God , therefore it is true (even with the inconsistencies between the different depictions of God, and the observations that all cultures have had witchcraft without that being true) ​3. There are no atheist cultures because God is so obvious to everyone (even though when we actually start figuring out how things really work, God gets less and less obvious).","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Sep/13/origins-of-religion-two-hypotheses/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Sep/13/origins-of-religion-two-hypotheses/"},{"title":"The Supernatural and the History of Cosmology","text":"I hold the view that the term \"supernatural\" is simply an incoherent concept. No one has been able to demonstrate that that the set of \"supernatural\" things is not empty, or how you would be able to tell! Still, if we presume that there is a coherent definition, and there is at least one thing in that set, and that one thing is a god which can interact with the world, then at least the effects should be testable. I was thinking about this term \"supernatural\" recently, and it occurred to me that this term is really a label-of-the-gaps and, because the only denizen of the supernatural is purported to be God: the term \"supernatural\" is a mask for the God of the gaps . This came to me when I realized that the ancient Christians did not believe in the supernatural! Their cosmology was weird (by modern standards), where they imagined different materials - both earthly and heavenly. Thus, God was in what they would call the universe, but located within a divine part of the universe (somewhere within the Moon and the other planets). See a few ancient writings, like the Ascension of Isaiah , for a tour. One of the issues the Church had with Galileo was that, with his telescope, it became clear that the Moon looked just like an ordinary rock and not something perfect, made of divine materials. Once we falsified the ancient cosmology, the \"heavens\" had to move somewhere else. Essentially, it has to move beyond where we can directly observe, which inconveniently for the theists, is nearly everywhere these days. Thus, the only place to go is the (undefined) region of the \"supernatural\". Notice that the influence of God has also followed this path, with the strongest arguments for God lurking in the ultimate origin of the universe (through the so-called fine-tuning of the physical constants), the origin of life (not the development of species, because once the first replicator is formed, evolution explains the resulting diversity), and ancient history (because modern history doesn't show the evidence of God's influence) - all out of reach of our current access to data. So , when theists toss around the term \"supernatural\", we can recognize it for what it is - a simple statement of ignorance, and another facet of the God-of-the-Gaps .","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Sep/04/the-supernatural-and-the-history-of-cosmology/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Sep/04/the-supernatural-and-the-history-of-cosmology/"},{"title":"God in the head","text":"On the Unbelievable Facebook page, Delia Ives posted: The evidence that God exists as an idea inside peoples' heads and the lack of evidence that he exists elsewhere is so obvious that theists have no excuse for denying it.

David Hickman commented the following: God as an idea explains Divine Hiddenness, Geographical distribution of Religion, individual variety of understanding of god's nature/character, and the evolution of theology. Which I thought was very well put. If you think of it as two hypotheses, H1=\"God is real\" [I know that this isn't just one hypothesis, because of the lack of definition...just to simplify], and H2=\"God is in the head\", it is interesting to think of the explanatory power and the predictive power of the two hypotheses. I would add that H2 also easily explains the types of miracles. We don't get amputees growing back limbs, but we do get things that can be influenced by placebo and those that can get better on their own. It would be interesting to think of other things on each side of this analysis.

The critique was phrased something like, that Dr Stenger put his atheism first in his explanations, that he has a presupposition against against using God as an explanation, a presupposition against the supernatural. Something struck me as odd about this perspective, and then I realized that one never hears this sort of perspective in scientific circles. Why not? I think it's because, in science, it is recognized that the natural world will correct any wrong presupposition...the truth will out. So, if someone has a presupposition, just let it ride out and see if it works. Einstein had a presupposition for a static universe - he even \"corrected \" his theory to get rid of the dynamics when it was pointed out to him that that was a consequence. Once the data came in that was best explained with a dynamics universe, he modified the theory and said it was a big mistake. Another example comes from my own experience teaching astronomy. For years I taught the prevailing wisdom that there were two possibilities for the end of the universe. Either the expanding universe, initiated at the Big Bang, would have enough mass to collapse again in a Big Crunch or it would expand forever, slowing but never stopping. It was never on the radar that it could be accelerating, and had anyone suggested it, I would have said it was unreasonable. Of course the universe doesn't care about my bias, lack of imagination, or presupposition and it does appear to be accelerating nonetheless. So, if someone has a presupposition against God as an explanation, indulge them! If they are wrong, then at some point it will make a bad prediction and fail. If not, then we've learned that, for the thing explained, the concept of God is not necessary . Don't complain about the presupposition. Know that the truth will out, eventually. On the other hand, I would love to know what predictions the God theory makes (not post-dictions), so that it can be tested.","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Aug/30/presuppositions-and-science/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Aug/30/presuppositions-and-science/"},{"title":"Textual Transmission Bottlenecks","text":"So I've been thinking about the origins of Christianity and the texts that we have which concern it. Then I watched Richard Carrier's new presentation on why he thinks Jesus didn't exist , and I started thinking about this again. The question I have, particularly for Christians, is What sort of effect, and what magnitude of an effect, do you believe the process of textual transmission from 0CE to 1000CE had on what we can look at today concerning the origin of Christianity? This includes the number, quality, and contents of the ancient texts around the time of Jesus, for example. I think there are a number of uncontroversial claims we can make about this question. The Christian church had a near monopoly on the textual transmission for over 1000 years, so any and all texts went through this bottleneck of transmission. Texts were written in other people's name (e.g. 1 Peter, Letter to Timothy, etc...), whether well-meaning or not. Texts were modified during this period, either deliberately or not. Not all texts were preserved. This fourth point is key, because it plays into what we have to look at now. First, only texts deemed important would generally be copied. So we would expect to have more texts of the canonical view, whatever that happened to be. Secondly, alternative theologies, different perspectives, hostile and critical treatments would not make the cut. This isn't deliberate censorship, it is simply a product of the limited attentional energies of scribes. Thus, these texts would be exceedingly rare or non-existent, thus giving a very different picture of the real situation at the time. Thirdly, contrary views could possibly be deliberately destroyed, and we have evidence of that happening sometimes as well. Now, apologists will often make the claim that the Biblical texts that we do have are very near the originals, or we can reconstruct a near original from the comparison with the many copies we have. They often point out that we have many more copies (and earlier copies) of Biblical texts than, say, of Plato's texts. Fair enough. But this is what we would expect from the points above, and so it is not surprising. I have two thoughts on this. Firstly what I always wonder is how much of what we have is really a collection of the \"winner's\" texts. If there were (as we know to be the case) many different views of Jesus around the time, many with conflicting perspectives, would much of them survive the points above? This is easily verified by the Dead Sea Scrolls, where texts were hidden from the deliberate process of the early church purging the conflicting theological texts. If the Library of Alexandria hadn't been burned, would we have the same view of Christianity as we have now? It's like, if the Discovery Institute were the only publisher of science textbooks for 100 years, would we even know science? At least in the case of science, there is the natural world to consult to confirm, but no such confirmation comes from historical texts. Of course what we don't have we can't really use in an argument, but it does make one wonder, and should make one highly suspect of any text that has survived the points above. Secondly, and this is the part that really gets me, is the fact that there is not a single mention in the first century of Jesus as a person, except for the Gospels and less than a handful of known other sources which are either Christian forgeries (i.e. the interpolations in Josephus) or contested texts (i.e. Tacitus). Here, one might cry \"argument from silence fallacy\", but the key difference is the process described above. Given what we know about the process of textual transmission for 1000 years, we would expect any significant, outside reference to Jesus to be enthusiastically copied and distributed, and yet we still have such a paucity of data? We have complaints from early church fathers, such as Origen and Justin Martyr, concerning the lack of early reference to Jesus in, say, Josephus so we know it mattered to them. So much so that someone felt that Josephus needed to be modified to include a reference! This point, for me, is what undermines my confidence in the existence of Jesus. I would say that for me, personally, I am agnostic on it. I am not convinced that he existed at all - I don't find any of the arguments compelling - however, I wouldn't bet strongly that he didn't exist. Still an interesting question, though.","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Aug/20/textual-transmission-bottlenecks/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Aug/20/textual-transmission-bottlenecks/"},{"title":"Trying to figure out fiction I like - Game of Thrones semi-fail","text":"So I just read the first book of the Fire and Ice series (Game of Thrones), and am not going to read any more. In fact, I pulled a \"24\" on it. This is a reference to what I did with the series \"24\" - a series I liked, in many ways. At the time of watching \"24\", I got stressed out with the kid-kidnapping scenes (as a parent, this sort of thing bothers me way more than when I wasn't), and the entire scenario was just too stressful! I felt I couldn't continue, but I also couldn't not continue because I needed closure. So, I decided to watch the last episode of that season, ruining all of the surprises, and then I had closure and could put it down. With Game of Thrones, I liked the narrative, but the world wasn't compelling to me. I thought there was too much going on at once, so there seemed like too little direction. I don't really care about this king overthrowing that king, etc... I like a personal story, or message. I want the story to be going somewhere, and after 600+ pages it just wasn't. I could imagine the story in Game of Thrones just going on and on, and not caring much for the outcome (especially when the only people you care about in the story seem to have a short shelf life). So, realizing this, I didn't want to put the effort in to read through all of the rest of the novels, but I also wanted closure. So, I decided to read all the plot summaries for the other four books - summaries which actually supported my initial assessment of the story not really going anywhere in particular, but a lot of stuff happening. I am trying to think of what I like, and why. So I liked Lord of the Rings, which if you recall you get the big story arc within the first couple chapters, and then add to it as you go along. However, the characters are always trying to accomplish something. Win or lose, at least it is clear what the outcomes could be. Babylon 5, the big story arc is introduced mid-season 1, and then added to from the end of season 1 to the peak in the middle-to-late season 3. There were a number of compelling mini-arcs here, and mysteries, which allowed you to get into the characters in the beginning, and also to tie the seasons together. Battlestar Gallactica only had mini-arcs, and no big arc. Within each mini-arc it was very good. Overall, it fell a bit flat because there wasn't anything tying it together. Harry Potter was excellent, much of which due to an interesting world. So, Game of Thrones didn't fit the type of fiction I like, even though the narrative itself was quite interesting and well written. What would I like? Not sure. Not sure what the pattern is with what I like, and what I don't. This is probably why I generally read non-fiction.","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Aug/19/trying-to-figure-out-fiction-i-like-game-of-thrones-semi-fail/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Aug/19/trying-to-figure-out-fiction-i-like-game-of-thrones-semi-fail/"},{"title":"What would it take for me to believe the Resurrection?","text":"So in a comment on a previous post , I am asked \"what sort of evidence would convince you of, let's say, the resurrection of Jesus?\" I want to break this up into two separate questions, because it will put into context my perspectives on historical evidence. What would it take for me to believe that there was a modern resurrection? Take a case of a Nigerian Pastor resurrected in 2001 after being dead for 3 days following a severe car accident. Sounds about as good as it gets, as far as evidence. Certainly way more evidence than we have for Jesus - many more \"witnesses\", documentation of medical examination, many more recent accounts, etc… There are some skeptical accounts here and also here . This is the first I've heard of it. Am I convinced? Nope. Why not? the fact that there is a definite possibility of motive for fraud and/or exaggeration the fact that the events occur in a culture riddled with superstitious thinking the fact that the events take place in a region without the proper diagnostic technology the story contains elements such as a transfer to a smaller, lesser equipped hospital where the patient knew the doctors when - given the supposed severity of the accident- the nearby, bigger hospital would be the logical choice Each of these raises the level of suspicion. What I am criticizing here is that the claims are being made and investigated by possibly credulous individuals, who have something to gain, and do not make the proper steps to rule out fraud, exaggeration, mistakes, etc… When I look at an extraordinary claim, I want these. To convince me it would take a group of unrelated individuals backing up the claims… …applying strict skeptical methods, … …with nothing or little to gain, … …and a history of honesty I would want to see confirmation from people who have something to lose in agreeing to it, either a significant departure from their professed beliefs, or something similar. Pretty much I'm asking for something similar to the JREF prize , although it need not be that particular organization. Is this too skeptical? I don't think so. I hold this same level of skepticism for scientific claims, two examples I outline in a previous post . To shamelessly quote myself, \"If the evidence is not enough to convince a reasonable skeptic, then we can't be particularly confident in it.\" This is especially the case with extraordinary claims. What would it take for me to believe that there was an ancient resurrection? Given this, could I ever be made to believe in an ancient resurrection? Probably not. Not because I am closed to it, but the kinds of methods and evidence that I would need to convince me of a modern resurrection just didn't exist 2000 years ago. Four accounts (five if you count Paul), that demonstrate mutual copying, and don't even claim to be eyewitnesses is hardly convincing for even more meagre claims than miraculous resurrections. Christians, do you believe every miracle claim? If not, what criteria do you use? If the same amount of evidence for Jesus' resurrection existed today (i.e. a handful of 2nd and 3rd hand reports, no physical evidence, and no skeptical inquiry), would you be convinced? I would wager that not a single honest Christian would accept this, or else they'd have to accept a million other miracle claims from other faiths, and be so credulous as to not be functional.","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Jul/27/what-would-it-take-for-me-to-believe-the-resurrection/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Jul/27/what-would-it-take-for-me-to-believe-the-resurrection/"},{"title":"A question for theists: why do you not believe UFOs are alien spacecraft?","text":"Now, I am really not trying to be snarky here, so please hear me out. Try to honestly ask yourself the question: what evidence would make you reasonably sure that a UFO claim is in fact an alien spacecraft? Would it take 1 photo or 100? Would it take 4 testimonials from eyewitnesses, or 50? Would it depend who reports it, like the New York Times or NASA? Would you need someone to stake their reputation on it, or their life? Would you require physical evidence, or would a report suffice? What would it take? If you really wrap your head around this question, and come up with a possible list of evidence that would possibly sway your opinion, as well as the reasons why that evidence would be convincing, you'll start to understand what an atheist thinks of the resurrection of Jesus. When the day is done, the only evidence for the resurrection comes from (at best) four (so-called) eyewitness testimonials written decades after the events and the possible (although extremely dubious) reports of a handful of people believing so strongly they they laid their life down for it. There is no physical evidence, and no more than a handful of extra-biblical references (again, with dubious or weak content). From all of the arguments I've heard, this seems convincing to Christians. Compared to UFO reports, for every eye-witness claimed for the resurrection, I can produce 100 witnesses for alien spacecraft - with direct reports within hours of the events. For every supposed apostle who is claimed to have been martyred, I can produce several people giving their lives for the belief in alien spacecraft (think, Heaven's Gate here). For every extra-biblical reference, I can give you thousands of photos, metal implants and alien abduction therapy session reports - all of which is stronger evidence than any of the extra-biblical references to Jesus (some of which are forged). Yet, despite all of this, I am not at all convinced that UFOs are alien spacecraft, and neither are most people. Why is it then, that people are convinced by the --far less-- evidence for the resurrection?

Description of Episode Full Title: The Probability of the Resurrection - Calum Miller & Chris Hallquist - Unbelievable? - 06 July 2013 – Is the resurrection 97% likley as Swinburne claims? Christian philosopher Richard Swinburne has used probability theory to show that the likelihood of the resurrection of Christ is 0.97. Calum Miller is a Christian apologist and student of Swinburne. He talks about why he believes that probability theory can be used to show that the resurrection is highly likely to be true. Chris Hallquist is an atheist blogger who argues that the resurrection is not well supported by evidence or probability.

Justin Brierley - Christian Moderator Calum Miller - Christian Chris Hallquist - Atheist Notes Me - I was really looking forward to this episode. What was not to like? Probability theory, ancient religions, evidence for Christianity…bring it on! Unfortunately, it really wasn't that impressive. Calum - \"There's what's called the confirmation of resurrection, the explanatory power. And this is basically the idea that there is a lot of evidence which, if the resurrection happened would be expected but if the resurrection didn't happen, it would be very improbable. And if this is true, if there really is that kind of evidence, then it follows from probability theory that our confidence in the resurrection should be greatly increased by this evidence. [Concerning the prior], more extraordinary or extreme events are more improbable to begin with, and so you would need more evidence to confirm them. So a lot of the debate about the resurrection comes down to the prior probability, whether we think it is actually really improbable and that no possible evidence could ever make us convinced of it. \" Me - He basically has the distinction between the following as the basis for all of the \"calculation\": evidence that, if it existed, would be very common if the resurrection did happen evidence that, if it existed, would be very rare if the resurrection didn't happen the prior probability for the resurrection where he admits that \"the debate about the resurrection comes down to the prior probability \". Anyone doing probabilistic inference knows that it should never come down primarily to your choice of priors. The data needs to rise above the prior, and the prior needs to be an honest -ideally objective- assessment of the pre-data probability assignments or, often, the initial state of ignorance. By admitting this, Calum is essentially saying either that: the data are not strong enough to constrain a diffuse prior, and thus is unconvincing or… you have to come into the debate with a sharp prior which admits to a presupposition of the strength of the claim. . Neither of these stances is convincing in the slightest. Further, in response to this set up, he ignores the most important thing in any Bayesian treatment is the set of models that you are using to compare. You cannot simply test the truth of a single model in isolation, nor is it generally informative to compare model A true or false. Instead one wants to set up a list of models, hypotheses, theories to explain the data and evaluate those multiple models. Instead of, $$ P({\\rm resurrection}|{\\rm data}) $$ and $$ P(\\mbox{not resurrection}|{\\rm data}) $$ you'd want $$ P({\\rm resurrection}|{\\rm data}), P({\\rm hallucination}|{\\rm data}), P({\\rm legend}|{\\rm data}), P({\\rm literary}|{\\rm data}), P({\\rm hoax}|{\\rm data}), $$ etc… where of course each of these models would have many details beyond the simple label I'm putting in here. By being explicit with what you're comparing to, it is easier to see where the different prior probabilities come in. Are you really going to suggest that someone rising from the dead is on par, prior to the data, with a legendary construction given how many legendary constructions we've seen and how many dead rising we've not seen? What is clear is that all of these other models must, a priori, be more probable than rising from the dead even if a God exists . Just because you believe miracles could happen does not mean that you believe every miracle claim is true, and given the number of clearly false miracle claims, the prior probability for any miracle claim must be quite low - even if you believe miracles actually occur. Another point about the data which Calum never deals with is that it should include things we don't see, not just things we do. If we expect something to occur with a claim, and we don't see it, that is in fact evidence against the claim. Chris - Most Christians might discount the claim that the miracles around African religions seem to disappear in the US and UK because of lack of faith. Or perhaps the miracle stories around Mormonism. What makes the miracles of Jesus different than these ones? Once you accept the idea that resurrection claims can exist quite commonly in a group of religiously charged people, it is no longer quite so hard to understand the resurrection claims in the Bible. Calum - The reports of an empty tomb are exactly what you'd expect if the resurrection actually happened, and would be unlikely in the case of a non-resurrection event. Me - Dealing with this is actually very simple. He is correct that if the resurrection occurred , then the report of an empty tomb would very likely be given, and I would add that it would also be very likely to be reported in the earliest accounts we have of the resurrection. Is this what we see? No! The empty tomb is not mentioned in Paul, neither are the physical visitations, both of which you'd expect to see if the Resurrection actually occurred. Even the visitations are not mentioned in Mark! So, from a probabilistic point of view, this is the exact opposite of what we'd expect to see if the resurrection actually occurred. In fact the descriptions of the resurrection get more elaborate and more physical the later the text (Paul has visions, Mark has no visitations but the empty tomb, Matthew and Luke have visitations, John has the doubting Thomas story, etc…). This is exactly what we'd expect for legendary development, or a story that has been embellished over time. The other thing, is it really all that unlikely to have an empty tomb story with no resurrection? Notice, I'm not saying to have an empty tomb, but to have an empty tomb story . There are several different routes to get that. One is as a literary device. I believe Richard Carrier supports this, as a reference to Daniel. Another is a deliberate counter to Docetism , to gain favor and win an argument. Calum - \"It is not necessarily helpful to have just some kind of religious context, it must be the right kind of one. So, for example, I can see very good reasons why God would want to vindicate Jesus' teaching by resurrecting him because I think Jesus taught a lot of very good things, I thought he was (obviously as a Christian) I think he was a very sincere, a very good person. And I can think of a lot of good reasons why God would choose Jesus to be a prophet and to become incarnate in him. Whereas I don't see comparably good reasons why God would want to vindicate Mormon teaching. Obviously a lot of that is because I don't know a lot about Mormonism but there's still the asymmetry there.\" Chris - The positive evidence for Mormonism is a lot better than for Christianity. We have signed documents by the early followers and founders attesting to the miracles. The best we can say about Paul's evidence is that he had a vision. We have a lot of negative evidence for Mormonism, to be sure, but if we knew more about Christianity perhaps things would be different. Me - I would add that we have this pro-Christian filter for all of our documents, a filter called the Middle Ages, where documents supporting Christianity had a much better probability of surviving (i.e. copied) than ones critical of Christianity. The only reason we have the Nag Hammadi texts is that the monks refused to burn them, as ordered by the Christian orthodoxy at the time, and instead chose to store them in a cave. Think about that campaign of whitewashing for hundreds of years! Actually, the fact that we have so little actual documentary support for Christianity coming from the first century, despite this huge bias, to me argues against Christianity. Chris- How do you know Jesus was sincere or not? Seems like the same could be said for Joseph Smith. Afterward - a bit about priors (this section is all Me - , so I won't put it in bold.) I don't really think that when Calum is referring to priors that he really means that in the same way as before the data . It seems to me, and I believe Swinburne's analysis reflects this, that the prior for this calculation is really the posterior for a previous calculation regarding the existence and properties of God. This is perfectly legitimate Bayesian procedure, but it makes the argument a different one. Because of this, Swinburne's calculation for the probability of God needs to be addressed before we can even deal with the priors in this resurrection argument. That will have to be another post entirely, but at any rate Calum did not do it a service in this debate, having not really gotten to the meat of it when he could have.","tags":"Unbelievable Project","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Jul/11/unbelievable-project-the-probability-of-the-resurrection/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Jul/11/unbelievable-project-the-probability-of-the-resurrection/"},{"title":"Baseball and the Naming of the Gospels","text":"So I was listening to the Reasonable Doubts podcast , and in either the episode on the nativity or the one on the reasonableness of Christianity (both debates), the theist in the debate said something to the effect that, had the Gospels been forged (i.e. weren't written by the claimed disciple Matthew, translator Mark, historian Luke, and disciple John) then the forgers would have chosen more notable author names, such as Peter or James, to enhance the reputation of the text. He then made an analogy with baseball card forgeries, and said that if you were to make a forgery of baseball cards you'd choose someone like Babe Ruth, and not some lesser player. I love analogies with the rebuttal built in! If you were forging baseball cards, you most certainly wouldn't do one of Babe Ruth, because the BS meter would peg on anyone who you showed it to. You would want to choose one that was valuable but not too valuable. Otherwise, it might be rejected outright. It would follow that there is some advantage to choosing a name that has some prestige (e.g. Matthew) but not too much (e.g. Peter). This is not to mention that the names on the documents were added many decades after they were written, the order of the Gospels was determined with the mistaken idea that Matthew was primary, and that the so-called eye-witness (Matthew) copies verbatim the text of a non eye-witness (Mark).","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Jul/07/baseball-and-the-naming-of-the-gospels/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Jul/07/baseball-and-the-naming-of-the-gospels/"},{"title":"Rules for Criticizing Opponents","text":"Below is an excerpt from Dan Dennett's article article \"tools for thinking\". I heard an interview with him on Point of Inquiry , which I would say was just \"ok\". I wanted to hear more about the tools, and too much of the interview time was spent talking about free will and consciousness. Just how charitable are you supposed to be when criticising the views of an opponent? If there are obvious contradictions in the opponent's case, then you should point them out, forcefully. If there are somewhat hidden contradictions, you should carefully expose them to view – and then dump on them. But the search for hidden contradictions often crosses the line into nitpicking, sea-lawyering and outright parody. The thrill of the chase and the conviction that your opponent has to be harbouring a confusion somewhere encourages uncharitable interpretation, which gives you an easy target to attack. But such easy targets are typically irrelevant to the real issues at stake and simply waste everybody's time and patience, even if they give amusement to your supporters. The best antidote I know for this tendency to caricature one's opponent is a list of rules promulgated many years ago by social psychologist and game theorist Anatol Rapoport. How to compose a successful critical commentary: 1. Attempt to re-express your target's position so clearly, vividly and fairly that your target says: \"Thanks, I wish I'd thought of putting it that way.\" 2. List any points of agreement (especially if they are not matters of general or widespread agreement). 3. Mention anything you have learned from your target. 4. Only then are you permitted to say so much as a word of rebuttal or criticism. One immediate effect of following these rules is that your targets will be a receptive audience for your criticism: you have already shown that you understand their positions as well as they do, and have demonstrated good judgment (you agree with them on some important matters and have even been persuaded by something they said). Following Rapoport's rules is always, for me, something of a struggle… I like these rules, in theory, and perhaps I should try practicing them more strictly to see if they are valuable in practice. I think the context might matter. In a debate, with limited time, it might not work. It may also not work well if you suspect that your opponent is going to quote-mine the heck out of your response. However, it may be a good attitude to develop, and keep one from falling into closed-minded arrogance. Even if one doesn't communicate this directly, forcing yourself to itemize points of agreement is probably a good thing, and it is always a good idea to be able to communicate ones opponents position with fidelity. A quick survey of responses of people who don't like Dan Dennett claim that he isn't putting these words to good use himself, although I think he probably comes closer than the other \"horsemen\" (i.e. Dawkins, Harris, Hitchens).

In this latest reply he brings in a large amount of global history that I simply cannot comment on. I am not nearly as well read in those issues. However, this provides an opportunity to address another problem that comes up in many of these conversations: how do you deal with claims that you can't track down yourself? Perhaps there is not enough time to track them down, or it is too technical for you to understand, or some other reason. I'll deal with that issue at the end. First, I want to comment on this from Marshall: Brian argues at a lower decibel level. Thanks! I'm not sure if everyone agrees that I operate at low decibel, but I do try to be civil (most of the time!). Sam Harris thinks it is obvious that owning slaves is wrong. Brian Blais thinks it obvious that gay marriage is OK. I think it is obvious that both beliefs are formed in a particular culture due to that culture's heritage, pulled in certain directions by particular lines of thinking, and would not likely take the same form in, say, Aztec or Wahhabi societies so readily. Again, I draw a distinction between the cultural bias that each of us have and the more objective perspectives we can obtain through rational discourse. There are two moral issues, here: (1) Why should we care about \"increasing suffering\" that is not our own suffering, or (a Confucianist may ask) of that of people we are intimately related to? (2) Why should we assume that in fact, these particular \"evils\" really do cause more suffering? (More than, say, pornography? Or growing up with Dad? Or abortion? Or intellectual arrogance?) If you read Sam Harris' book, or see some of his lectures on this issue, he deals with it far more eloquently than I. In a practical way, we care about the suffering of others because it is directly tied to the suffering of us. Further, we must care about the suffering of conscious creatures because this is the moral thing to do. I don't want to repeat all of Harris' theses here, however. Why should we \"assume\" these particular \"evils\" do cause more suffering? Actually, we do not simply assume it. We marshal (no pun intended, David) the evidence for it. This is what separates a rational basis for morality and a religious one - there are no dictates from \"on high\". I could be wrong about it, but from what evidence I can see, depriving the rights of a minority that most enjoy causes needless suffering. This applies to slavery and it applies to the rights of consenting adults to marry. How does Blais know his own set of values is superior to all those others I guess I don't, except in cases where someone is making a moral claim and cannot justify on the basis of decreased suffering. It's like scientific knowledge that way - how do I know that my knowledge is better than another? I don't, until they make specific claims and I see their justification. I could be wrong about it. I could be corrected, and convinced of a perspective I don't currently hold. I don't see a problem with this. Finally, one might argue, from a utilitarian point of view, that the Athenians increased total happiness by enslaving half their population, so that free men could sculpt, debate, write philosophy, and invent science. Might there not be a larger total sum of happiness in such a Republic, than among a people that is all free, but fails at such achievements? Or would the Athenians have increased the world's total future happiness without those slaves? This is indeed possible. No one ever said that the moral calculus would be easy. Marshall continues… But the Gospel does say, very clearly, that we are to care even for our enemies, return good for evil, and love our neighbors as ourselves. There's nothing \"vague\" about that: it's repeated hundreds of times, in different ways, and as eloquently as anything ever written. It also says: Do not think that I came to bring peace on Earth; I did not come to bring peace, but a sword. For I came to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; and a man's enemies will be the members of his household. and But those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them–bring them here and kill them in front of me. The recurring problem is that there are good things there, but also bad things there. Given the history of Christianity, and the current divisions between different groups of Christians, I am not simply picking things out of context. Intelligent, well-meaning people draw opposite messages from the Bible. If this were, say, the works of Shakespeare I'd have no problem with it. We'd simply take the lessons we like, and call the rest of it anachronistic. This is what moderate Christians do with much of Bible. Even conservative Christians do it with at least the brutal dictates in the Old Testament. Even the New Atheists are waging verbal civil war on one another, based on different ethical positions they take in regard to feminism. Atheism is simply the label we give to people who are not convinced by the arguments of theists on the narrow question about the existence of God. After that, there needn't be any agreement. That atheists disagree on feminism is perfectly fine. If they disagreed on the existence of God, then there would be a problem. But I don't think educated Christians are so starkly divided, compared to the various schools of atheism. Really? You think that, say, educated Baptists and Catholics really agree on core interpretations of the divinity of Jesus? What about with Universalists? These are divisions about core beliefs, not tangential topics like feminism. Dealing with claims beyond ones ability to check In Marshall's post, he says My impression is that it is also rather hard to find early reform movements within Hindu culture that challenged caste. Mohandas Gandhi came at the tail end of reform inspired by outside forces (Christian missions), as John Farquhar shows in Modern Religious Movements in India. In China, while some ethnic groups refrained from binding the feet of women, like the Hakka, it took an outside agent – Christian missions, again – to challenge it inside the Han Chinese culture as a whole. I don't have the expertise in history to really comment, nor can I make an authoritative judgement on it. However, I am skeptical of it nonetheless. Why? If someone makes a claim about the rise of Napoleon, beyond my ability to confirm, I will tend to believe them - unless I suspect that this claim supports some other strongly held belief of the person. In that case, I would be skeptical of it. In the case of this description from Marshall, it sounds too much like the claim that started this discussion, that somehow Christianity was the source of \"separation of church and state\". A claim that I believe is biased in the direction of Marshall's personal beliefs in the tenets of Christianity. It seems, although I can't demonstrate it conclusively without a lot more work, to be of a similar flavor. I ran into the same problem with UFO sightings. I can't investigate every single UFO claim, but every one that I did have time to track down turned out to be mundane. The same with faith-healings. This one deals with the force of history, and I simply don't have the time to corroborate the facts, but I am still left unconvinced. Perhaps that puts this conversation at an end, with all of the issues pretty much on the table for others to read and react to. It has certainly been an interesting and challenging exchange.","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Jun/13/the-source-of-morality/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Jun/13/the-source-of-morality/"},{"title":"Christianity and morality","text":"In a comment to one of my posts about miscellaneous Christian ideas, David Marshall asks the following question : Why do you suppose that you think slavery is wrong? How do you know it isn't because you are at the end of a long process of Christianization of morals within western thought, that I (briefly) describe? I think this is a fair question, and felt it needed some thought, so I took a few days to ponder it. I'm sure there is more to be said on this, but let me outline my thinking process on this. Where did I come by the concept of why slavery is wrong? I'd say it starts with the way I was brought up, where I learned to treat people well. From there, learning history, I could see that history is filled with examples of people treating others badly (including owning other people as property) and people treating others well. Of course, this part is cultural, and if I had been raised in the South in the 1830's, slavery would not immediately seem obviously wrong. As an adult, one learns about the proper justification for beliefs. How beliefs should be based on evidence, and learning the methods of science, I was able to much better evaluate the reasons behind claims, and also understand the ways in which erroneous justifications have been made for many claims. This ties into psychology, economics, and a whole host of other human activities. After all this, I've come to accept that morality relates to the suffering and well-being of conscious creatures. As such, we can make objective evaluations about how to increase well-being and decrease suffering. It becomes clear, then, that owning people as property needlessly increases suffering, and as such is objectively wrong. I can then apply this principle in cases where I was raised with a different moral perspective, and find that some of these are wrong. For example, banning gay marriage is wrong (sorry for the double negative!), even if I was raised with the opposite. It needlessly adds to human suffering. So, I can override my cultural teachings on morality, and in the same way I am able to judge other worldviews for obvious cases of immoral behavior (e.g. suicide bombing, genocide, etc...) How do I know it isn't because I am at the end of a long process of Christianization of morals within western thought? I prefer to rephrase, slightly, saying \"why do I believe it is likely...\" instead of \"how do I know...\". This is a matter of probability, and I don't think it is possible to demonstrate the truth of a claim like this to the level of probability that I would consider knowledge. So why do I believe \"slavery is wrong\" is unlikely to be simply the end of a process of Christianization? First and foremost, I see no clear evidence that Christianity as revealed in the Bible has a clear message against slavery. You can find passages vaguely against particular slave-master situations, and you can find dictates about how you should treat your slaves. There is never a case where it says, clearly , that slavery is in fact wrong. Second, there is historical precedent for Christians to argue for slavery based on a Biblical reading - and this wasn't just a fringe reading. One might argue that they are using a wrong reading, but how do we know? Thirdly, following on this, my experience with legitimate searches for truth is that they converge after some initial state of disagreement. Take any previously contentious argument in science that is currently well understood - say, the origin of heat. Over the past couple hundred years there were many theories about what heat was - the elemental theory of heat, a fluid theory, a statistical theory, etc... Once the scientific methodology was improved to the point where this problem could be explored rationally, the ideas started to converge. There were fewer interpretations of the evidence considered valid, and now there really is just one. This is true for every branch of science, and I would contend, any approach that addresses the truth - you start off with divergent ideas when you don't fully understand a topic, and converge to a single understanding. I see no evidence of this in Christianity. There is more disagreement now than 1000 years ago about pivotal doctrines. This is not the pattern we see for something that is true , but is a pattern for something we see a cultural . Finally, I do see evidence of Christians changing their doctrines to suit their particular ends. Most of the Old Testament is conveniently ignored, interpreted away, because it has become untenable in a modern society. Christian's don't do this because it is a natural, obvious step in the faith but because modern, secular progress has demonstrated that many of the doctrines are either wrong or simply useless. The authority of religion has been battered from all directions. Thus, I see evidence of cherry-picking, an inconsistent message in the Bible which allows for nearly any philosophical stance to justified with the proper cherry-picking, and a lot of post-hoc argumentation. I see immoral acts not only allowed by God, but commanded by God, and thus at best an inconsistent moral picture from the \"good\" book. I've heard it referred to as the \"great book of multiple choice\", and I believe that this interpretation is more consistent with all of the aspects I've seen about Christianity, both present and historical.","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Jun/10/christianity-and-morality/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Jun/10/christianity-and-morality/"},{"title":"Miscellaneous Christian topics - another counter to Marshall","text":"Over at David Marshall's blog he has posted a response to one of my Unbelievable Project posts (sidenote: I do promise to get back to that project...I have a number of episodes in the hopper, I just need a block of time to type). At any rate, let me counter again, and see where this goes. On the topic of \"militant atheism\", I pointed out a double standard in the use of the word \"militant\" to atheists and islamists. Marshall replies What causes us to call them \"militant,\" rather, is the refusal to admit the vast amount of good that the Judeo-Christian tradition has accomplished I think this makes my point. Do we call Militant Islamists \"militant\" because they refuse to see the good in other people? No, it's because they blow stuff up. You might call the New Atheists \"agressive\", \"obnoxious\", \"misguided\" or \"wrong\", but \"militant\" they are not. Marshall continues: Have more people been killed by angry Christian terrorists per Christian in recent years, or by angry atheist terrorists? Timothy McVeigh was an agnostic, that would count when atheists take census for the purpose of expanding their ranks. The Unabomber appears to have been an atheist. The Tamil Tigers, who do more of this sort of thing than almost anyone, may be as well. Now I could counter with things like anti-abortion violence , and that Timothy McVeigh's religious views were mixed at best , etc... However I think that, even if we grant that McVeigh was an atheist and the Unabomber too, that they didn't do the horrible things in the name of their atheism. However, the anti-abortion violence, and the historical violence of Christians, has been done in the name of the religion. That's a big difference, and one that seems to be conveniently ignored. Further, to compare the New Atheists (say, any of the four of Dawkins, Harris, Hitchens, and Dennett) to any of these people, or to Stalinist Russia, or Hitler, or any of them is totally ridiculous. No matter how strident they are, the New Atheists are not \"militant\" in the same way that militant Islamists are. On the point about \"separation of church and state\", which Marshall has stated was a Christian idea, and that I had countered with: \"If the separation was truly was a Christian idea, then I'd expect a totally different European history from 0 AD to 1700 AD! \", he counters with: But Blais is again not being reasonable about that history, either. First of all, Christians didn't attain much power until almost 400 AD. And secondly, the world in which Christians then attained power had fixed political structures, which transformed Christianity about as much as Christianity changed it. It is anachronistic to judge the 5th Century by what humanity has attained since. So, what you're saying, is that the Christians were victims of the political structure such that the fundamental Christian belief of \"separation of church and state\" was not able to be implemented for the 1300 year Christian rule? Sorry, but that seems like a dodge to me. Jesus also said, \"Forgive your enemies.\" The claim that this, too, is a Christian idea, is not rendered \"ridiculous\" by the fact that Christians have often actually killed and cursed, not forgiven, their enemies. An idea can be a Christian idea, even can come from Jesus' mouth, without therefore determining all subsequent Christian history. Sure. However, since there is no statement \"separation of church and state\" anywhere in the NT, it seems like quite a stretch to make the same claim. One can probably find a decent number of examples of people throughout the last 2000 years putting \"forgive your enemies\" to good use, or at least claiming it is a Christian idea. Can you find any examples prior to the enlightenment of any Christian espousing the separation of church and state, except in the most limited cases (e.g. you pay taxes to government not to the church). Clearly every European monarchy was founded on the establishment of a direct connection between church and state. Marshall didn't seem to like my response concerning the topic of slavery. I said: \" It is faint praise indeed that the best you can say about the Christian stance on slavery, historically, is that some slaves were freed so that 700 years later (!!!) some small areas in the world, that didn't feel that they needed slaves anymore, didn't have slaves. \" His response? Faint praise? Tens of millions of slaves have been freed, due to the abolitionist movements that began with praying Christians. To be clear, I am definitely against slavery, and I definitely think it is a great thing that tens of millions of slaves have been freed. That wasn't the point. The point was that Marshall said in the Unbelievable episode: Beginning in the fourth century slaves were set free so that by the eleventh century there were areas of western Europe free of slaves. So, put another way, Christian doctrine was so anti-slavery that, when the Christians had the most power, the best they could do was to take 700 years to rid some areas of Europe of slaves...areas that just didn't need slaves anyway. I don't think that's an impressive record. Sixty percent of anti-slave organizers were Christian pastors. Where does this come from? I'd like a citation for this. Regardless, it doesn't surprise me. I would also guess that most of the pro -slave organizers (like George Whitefield) were also Christian pastors. Why? Because, at that time (and still now, in the US) most of the people were Christians, and further, pastors were social and political organizers. So as a matter of probability, this claim would seem to be likely, and thus carries no weight in the argument. Marshall continues It is clear the New Testament condemns the slave trade, though. It is clear Paul told Philemon he should accept Onesimus back \"no longer as a slave, but as a dear brother.\" And it ought be clear that \"loving your neighbor as yourself\" is pretty hard to do if you put chains around your neighbor's neck. But Paul also says this: \"Slaves, obey your earthly masters with respect and fear, and with sincerity of heart, just as you would obey Christ. 6 Obey them not only to win their favor when their eye is on you, but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from your heart. 7 Serve wholeheartedly, as if you were serving the Lord, not people, 8 because you know that the Lord will reward each one for whatever good they do, whether they are slave or free .\"( Ephesians 6:5-8 ) Paul is not being particularly anti-slavery here. This is part of the problem - the message in the Bible is not clear, despite Marshall's claims to the contrary. Like fables and proverbs, you can find opposite messages, enough to justify whatever you'd like (e.g. too many cooks spoil the broth; many hands make light work). As a result, you get perspectives like: [Slavery] was established by decree of Almighty God...it is sanctioned in the Bible, in both Testaments, from Genesis to Revelation...it has existed in all ages, has been found among the people of the highest civilization, and in nations of the highest proficiency in the arts - Jefferson Davis, President, Confederate States of America Is he reading the same Bible? Is he simply dense and uninformed? Is the Bible so unclear that people can have such a diverse set of opinions on it? Finally, on the slavery issue, we have Marshall saying: But it is unrealistic and unreasonable to expect the Bible to institute a crusade against slavery from the get-go. Slavery was not, in fact, an unambiguous evil in the ancient world: the alternative (as in Herodotus, and even in Homer) was often to just kill enemy soldiers (or even civilians) whom you captured. What the Bible did, was slowly create a society, and a set of moral ideals, that made slavery less and less important, and liberation of slaves more and more admirable, even while glorifying labor, and enriching ordinary workers. Ok, let me get this straight. Marshall seems to be saying that the same God that created the universe , inspired the writing of the Bible, created our moral sense, and had a direct and personal hand in human affairs from, say, 4000 BC to 50AD (at least!) couldn't come up with a way to solve the slavery problem? Really? The best God could do was to drop in some conflicting perspectives on the issue into a book so that 1500 years after that we could finally get rid of slaves? Is it truly unreasonable to expect a clear condemnation of slavery in a book purporting to deliver the message of absolute morality from an all-knowing source? This is a remarkable claim! On to ID. One point of clarification I want to make is the following. Marshall tires of the lying label that I used: As for \"lying,\" the charge grows tedious. New Atheists are so eager with this charge -- even against C. S. Lewis, recently, and often against me -- one just wishes they would choose to argue like adults, frankly. However, I was not quoting New Atheists here, I was referring to what the conservative, Bush appointed Judge Jones said in his decision : It is ironic that several of these individuals, who so staunchly and proudly touted their religious convictions in public, would time and again lie to cover their tracks and disguise the real purpose behind the ID Policy. I've also read a fair amount about ID, read many of the sources (Behe, Dembski, others), read all of the Dover documents, followed Ken Miller's seminars, etc... I do not arrive at my opinions about ID entirely uninformed. ID is religion masquerading as science. Finally, Marshall on corporal punishment and child abuse: Though I'm a little curious about calling corporal punishment -- what, spanking a bratty child on the behind? -- \"child abuse.\" The classics work. I was thinking of more extreme examples of corporal punishment than \"spanking on the behind\". Either way, however, no matter your attitude toward spanking, the act of simply calling a child \"Christian\" is even less worthy of being labeled \"abuse\". I find Dawkins' language in this example so over the top that it ceases to be useful. That's it for now!","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Jun/07/miscellaneous-christian-topics-another-counter-to-marshall/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Jun/07/miscellaneous-christian-topics-another-counter-to-marshall/"},{"title":"Model helicopter guided by power of thought....","text":"I don't think I need to add anything to this one...the title and movie speak for themselves. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSTLHBrTgD4&feature=youtu.be All right, I'll add something...cool!","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Jun/05/model-helicopter-guided-by-power-of-thought/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Jun/05/model-helicopter-guided-by-power-of-thought/"},{"title":"Evidence Of Other Universes","text":"When I see things like this, I recall pieces of apologetics like \"everything that begins to exist has a cause\", and \"the existence of the multiverse is a bigger faith claim than the existence of God\", and they ring empty to me...even if these particular scenarios don't pan out, that they exist at all is a testament to science over religion... http://www.technologyreview.com/view/421999/astronomers-find-first-evidence-of-other-universes/","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Jun/05/evidence-of-other-universes/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Jun/05/evidence-of-other-universes/"},{"title":"Star Trek and Storytelling","text":"I'm a big fan of Star Trek. I grew up with it (on re-runs), followed the Next Generation and Deep Space Nine with interest. I did skip Voyager and Enterprise, but definitely follow the recent reboot movies. Although I still enjoy the storytelling of Star Trek, I do have a problem with it that creeps into other shows as well. I noticed it again in the most recent movie. Because Star Trek is a franchise, almost by definition, none of the characters can actually die or change in any substantive way. Because of this, from a storytelling perspective, dramatic scenes are a lot less dramatic. One way to see this also is to imagine spinning out possibly story lines, given only the pilot episode. If you did this for, say, Star Trek the Next Generation you would probably hit a few of episodes even as late as season 7. If, however, you tried to do it with Babylon 5 you wouldn't even make it to late season 2. Perhaps this is the story telling equivalent of market failures with monopolies. I enjoyed the new Star Trek movie (especially in 3D!), but I sometimes wish that this lingering constraint on the show were lifted. Imagine, for example, a series set in the Star Trek universe where the characters actually change? Where there isn't a technological solution to every problem? Where the outcome wasn't really known in advance?","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/May/30/star-trek-and-storytelling/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/May/30/star-trek-and-storytelling/"},{"title":"A little about miracles","text":"I listened to a recent interview ( Part 2 ) with Matthew Ferguson on the Don Johnson show , which I found pretty impressive. Matthew Ferguson has a very interesting blog that I just found, and have been enjoying reading. Initial Comments However, I did find several points in the informal debate that I thought could be handled better (from my armchair, of course!). Just to note that although I think that if I were there, I might have been able to deal with some of the questions better, I also think that nearly all of the debate was handled much better than I could have done. What struck me at one point, in Part 2 , was Don's zeal for the miracles collection by Craig Keener ( review of Keener's book here ). He seemed to think that because there were hundreds of thousands of miracle reports, that that was evidence for their truth. He was, however, quick to dismiss any comparison with other pseudosciences. Ferguson admits on his blog that the \"debate came off as a little ambushy\" on this point, because he hadn't read this book, and clearly couldn't respond to all of them, but I think that misses the point. I think one can address the miracle claims without being entirely dismissive (and sounding closed minded) but putting them in their proper context. Evaluating Miracle Claims - Some Lessons from UFOs So in Keener's book, there is a huge collection of claims of miracles. We could find an equally large collection of UFO sightings. Now, Don and other Christians would be quick to dismiss UFO sightings as irrelevant, but I would raise the questions: Given a set of claims, how do we determine whether they are true? Are any of them true? Do the number of claims contribute to their truth value? I believe that the methods we use to determine the veracity of UFO claims can be used to investigate any claims, remarkable or not, including miracle claims. To start, we clearly we can't personally investigate every single claim, and thus cannot comment on ones we haven't investigated except to note where it seems similar to ones that we have. I have a friend who I managed (over several years) to break of his UFO enthusiasm - he was convinced by all of these television shows claiming evidence for alien spacecraft observations and visitations. He invited me over to his house periodically to watch these shows to get my reaction. This is the process that I would use: I would write down each specific claim - what was actually being claimed, and what details were there? (names of places, time, who saw what, etc...) I would note any initial inconsistencies (for example, there was once where, in the interview process, the different witnesses actually described different things! this seemed to go unnoticed by the reporter) I would go home, and try to find out as much about the original details of the events. It would take me probably at least an hour for each case, and some I couldn't track down. However, many of them I could. I would read the claims again, and the skeptical accounts, and the responses to the skeptics. I would try to see what the actual data was, how it was collected, when it was reported, etc... What I found for every case that I personally investigated was the following: Most of the actual , original claims were mundane. Lights in the sky, marks on the ground, etc.... No hard evidence of anything remarkable. Misinterpretation of a known object, or objects, in the sky or on the ground. The reporting of the claims grew more and more remarkable. A particularly good example was the Rendelsham Forest UFO case where the initial reports were just lights, and the later reports involved spacecraft, alien code-books, etc... There were serious inconsistencies between reports, or anomalous non-reports (i.e. people who should have seen something but didn't). A good example of this was a Chicago airport sighting where a small group of people, in a localized area of the airport, saw something yet the large number of other people in the nearby areas of the airport reported nothing. I repeat - in every single case that I personally investigated, these points were in evidence. Then I look through something like the Condon report where they go through something like 30 years of data in the height of the UFO craze and don't come up with even a single item that is not mundane in its nature. After that, new UFO claims I see with suspicion even if I don't check them out. If something seems straightforward to check out, I might do it, but I don't feel it is my job to investigate every claim. If there had been even a single case which pointed to something probably remarkable, I'd have a different attitude. Lesson: if the claims made shrink and disappear at critical and skeptical investigation, the claim is not likely to be true. Miracles The Catholic Church has a division to investigate miracles, and has determined that some of them are genuine. However, the Catholic Church often has significant blinders, and definitely takes a long time to adjust to obvious mistakes (Galileo anyone?). Take, for example, this site on top 10 miracles . I've personally researched about 3 or 4 of these, and it is quite clear that those are definitely frauds (#1, 2, 3, and 5 I've checked). Yet, do we get any retraction from the Catholic Church? Do we get any hint of skepticism? None at all. Again, I follow the same steps as above. I do not take someone else's word, necessarily, and I don't discount them out of hand. The miracles of Fatima are a great example. First, we have \"visions\" from highly impressionable children, one of whom was known to have made up fanciful stories in the recent past. These children are the only ones who \"see\" it, until the last vision where hundreds claimed to see the \"Miracle of the Sun\". The problem? The initial stories did not agree, and we only get a semi-consistent story after the various witnesses spoke with each other and to a priest collecting the reports. Check out The Real Secrets of Fatima for the details. All of the elements spoken about above can be seen - initial mundane experiences, misinterpretation of known objects (i.e. the sun, and clouds), the exaggeration of stories in later recollection, serious inconsistencies in reports and notable non-reports. The same goes for every faith-healer I've read about. A little digging, and a little skepticism, and the entire enterprise come crashing down. Many times it doesn't take much digging! If the truth is there, then it shouldn't retreat under investigation. This is not a matter of being too skeptical . It is a matter of not being credulous.","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/May/21/a-little-about-miracles/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/May/21/a-little-about-miracles/"},{"title":"Creationist Math","text":"Introduction So I got pointed to the http://www.icr.org , which if you haven't poked around on the site, you really should. It is quite interesting (not really in a good way). However, I want to look at a particular article on the young earth , arguing from population growth rates. The relevant sentences are: Using census records from the last 400 years and a bit of algebra, and assuming a natural logarithmic growth, eight Flood survivors 4,500 years ago produce 7 billion people almost exactly. This is powerful evidence that biblical history is accurate, and man-made evolutionary history is not. Then they footnote the following: The formula for logarithmic human world population growth is \\(P = Po e&#94;{rt}\\) , where P = the current population, Po = the initial population, e = the base of natural logarithms (2.718), r = the average annual population growth rate (0.456% or 0.00456 in the calculator), and t = the time interval from \\(P_o\\) to \\(P\\) . Finally, in the middle of the article, they are incredulous of the low net birth rate in pre-agricultural human populations: Thus, the first human couple that supposedly evolved from ape-like ancestors would have had only 6 million descendants after 2.4 million years. This requires a population growth rate of about 0.000000009-essentially zero. Virtually no growth for 2.4 million years? So, how do we respond to this sort of analysis? One could try to simply write it off as the rantings of a person blinded, by their religious bias, to a true understanding of science. However I prefer an alternative approach. It may be tilting at windmills, but I prefer to take a claim at face value, and see why it fails, and to ask followup questions. Since the math here is so simple, it is easy to demonstrate any errors, assumptions, etc.. and get to the bottom of it. So, someone has made a claim, I don't agree, how do I proceed? Did they do their arithmetic right? Yes! The first thing I like to do is, assuming they are right in all of their numbers, do they do the calculation correctly. This eliminates a pretty obvious error that could have caused the problem. I suspected they got it right, but I wanted to make sure. The math is $$ P=P_o e&#94;{rt} $$ The code is: r=0.00456 t=4500.0 Po=8.0 print Po*exp(r*t)/1e9,\"billion\" Yielding 6.52849018681 billion The other direction is, how long ago were there only 8 people? \\begin{eqnarray} P(t)&=&P_o \\times e&#94;{r\\cdot t} \\\\\\\\ \\log P(t) &=& \\log(P_o) + r\\cdot t\\\\\\\\ t&=& \\frac{\\log(P(t))-\\log(P_o)}{r} \\end{eqnarray} or Po=6.5e9 # current population r=0.00456 P=8 # target population t=(log(P)-log(Po))/r print t, \"years\" resulting in -4499.04089302 years. Is their growth rate correct? Here I am using data from census.gov . It is possible (in fact likely) that the original post used a slightly different data set, but they didn't cite it so I can't confirm that. The conclusions will not be qualitatively different, but that would be one of the questions I'd have for the author (see below). It is instructive to look at the data set both on a normal scale and a log scale. The key thing here is that a constant growth rate translates to a straight line on the log scale . Let's see if this is the case (see the lower of the two plots, especially): Linear? Not so much. I then chose a time-frame over which to calculate the average which gave (for my data set) as close to their growth rate above - this is essentially the growth rate consistent with the Biblical chronology. In my data set that average is from 1300 to 2010, or 700 years (theirs, they claim, it was 400 years so there is clearly a difference in data sets here - however, they don't reference their actual data, and regardless, this same analysis would work in their case too). You can see from here that this average yields the Biblical number of 4500 years ago, but that it is clearly not a good assumption to think that the growth rate, even over this time-frame, is constant. Because of this, depending on how far back you do the averaging, you get a different time of the Flood. For example, the following show cases for 1600-2010, and 1950-2010. The last one is the closest to a constant growth rate, but gives a ridiculous -1200 years back to 8 people! (As an aside, Richard Dawkins does the same calculation with rats, and comes up with an astonishing 1900 or so for the beginning of the Earth.) Bottom Line The biggest problem with this calculation is assuming a constant growth rate. Once it isn't constant, then the time-frame over which you calculate the average makes a big difference. Only one possible time-frame will result in something consistent with the Biblical account, so one would have to justify: Why you can possibly assume constant growth rate in the distant past knowing it wasn't constant in the time-frame we know about. Even given a solid justification (which I don't believe actually exists...but I'm open to suggestions), you have to further justify why the particular time average you take, that is consistent with the Biblical account, is the one you should take. You can't use as a reason \"because it's consistent with the Biblical account\", because the entire point is to justify the Biblical account, or to demonstrate that the data is consistent with it. It's not, if you have to postulate that the Biblical account is correct, and choose the specifics of the calculations to meet that. Questions for Brian Thomas, M.S. at the ICR. Here are the questions I'd like answered. I'm not expecting any, but I'd be thrilled to get one! What data set did you use? I'm sure it won't make any difference, but it is good to make sure that we all agree on the numbers. I'd be happy to run my analysis through any data set that you provide. Using your data set, and your analysis, do you confirm my observation that your result is sensitive to the time-frame (i.e. the 400 years in your case, 700 years in mine) over which you are obtaining your \"average\" growth rate? If it is, do you have a justification for using that, and only that , time-frame? Do you have a justification for using an average growth rate model in the face of data that clearly shows that the growth rate is not constant? Comment about Growth Rates before Agriculture The original article was astounded that the growth rate, prior to agriculture, could be so low. Essentially, they seem to believe that exponential growth should have started once you had people, and gone at a constant rate the entire time. However, before agriculture, there would have been a fairly low carrying capacity , and human population would follow logistic growth , not exponential. Near the carrying capacity, the growth rate is essentially zero, exactly as observed. A little bit of reading on how populations actually change might be helpful to these people.","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/May/10/creationist-math/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/May/10/creationist-math/"},{"title":"Design, the Origin of Life, and Creationism","text":"I just listened to a recent Unbelievable podcast , an episode about the origin of life .

The question is the following: Once you rule out all of the naturalistic, non-design explanations [which we haven't, by the way], and if design is so evident in the biological molecules, then the next step should be to consider and rule out naturalistic design explanations…i.e. alien life designed life on this planet. Why is this explanation never raised by ID proponents? They claim that the \"designer\" is not, necessarily, God yet I never see them rule out alien minds as the designers. They jump from naturalistic, non-design right over to supernatural \"explanations\". I think, when pressed, they would have to deal with alien design, and their true nature.","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/May/06/design-the-origin-of-life-and-creationism/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/May/06/design-the-origin-of-life-and-creationism/"},{"title":"Consciousness in infants","text":"I've always been interested in the origin of consciousness, and am intrigued by attempts to quantify it and to detect it. A recent article in Science seems to address part of the origin of consciousness in infants. It makes you wonder what infant experience is like, and perhaps the semi-conscious experience of dogs, cats, octopi, and dolphins. The abstract is: Infants have a sophisticated behavioral and cognitive repertoire suggestive of a capacity for conscious reflection. Yet, demonstrating conscious access in infants remains challenging, mainly because they cannot report their thoughts. Here, to circumvent this problem, we studied whether an electrophysiological signature of consciousness found in adults, corresponding to a late nonlinear cortical response [\\~300 milliseconds (ms)] to brief pictures, already exists in infants. We recorded event-related potentials while 5-, 12-, and 15-month-old infants ( N = 80) viewed masked faces at various levels of visibility. In all age groups, we found a late slow wave showing a nonlinear profile at the expected perceptual thresholds. However, this late component shifted from a weak and delayed response in 5-month-olds (starting around 900 ms) to a more sustained and faster response in older infants (around 750 ms). These results reveal that the brain mechanisms underlying the threshold for conscious perception are already present in infancy but undergo a slow acceleration during development.","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Apr/28/consciousness-in-infants/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Apr/28/consciousness-in-infants/"},{"title":"Some recent presentations","text":"For any that are interested, I've given or been part of a number of presentations recently .

It started with an off-hand comment by a student, which led me to think more deeply about the problem once I actually worked it out. The problem was simple enough: You draw two cards from a deck, and ask what is the probability that the first is a black card, and the second is a jack. In math notation, we want: $$ P(B1,J2) $$ I compared with replacement to without replacement , and got the same answer, much to my surprise. After satisfying my surprise with a numerical simulation, I thought, \"there are clearly cases where it does make a difference between replacement and no replacement (drawing two jacks, for example), so where does it matter?\" Another case So I did another case: You draw two cards from a deck, and ask what is the probability that the first is a face card, and the second is a jack. In math notation, we want: $$ P(F1,J2) $$ With replacement: $$ \\begin{array}{rcl} P(F1,J2|{\\rm replace}) &=& P(F1) \\times P(J2) \\ &=&\\frac{12}{52} \\times \\frac{4}{52} = \\frac{48}{2704}=0.0178 \\end{array} $$ Without replacement $$ \\begin{array}{rcl} P(F1,J2|{\\rm no-replace}) &=& P(F1) \\times P(J2|F1) \\\\ &=&\\frac{12}{52} \\times \\left(P(J2|F1,J1)P(J1|F1)+P(J2|F1,\\overline{J1})P(\\overline{J1}|F1)\\right)\\\\ &=&\\frac{12}{52} \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{51} \\cdot \\frac{4}{12}+\\frac{4}{51} \\cdot \\frac{8}{12} \\right)\\\\ &=&\\frac{44}{2652}\\\\ &=&0.0166 \\end{array} $$ The General Case It appeared to me that there was a pattern - some relationship between the number of jacks, the number of cards, and the number of the sub-population (color, face, etc...) such that the replacement and the no-replacement cases would come out the same, because most cases don't. So I looked at it in general, where I define: $$ \\begin{array}{rcl} N_C &=& \\mbox{number of cards} \\\\ N_J &=& \\mbox{number of jacks} \\\\ N_F &=& \\mbox{number of the sub-population (faces, color, etc...)}\\\\ N_{JF} &=& \\mbox{number of jacks in the sub-population} \\end{array} $$ With replacement: $$ \\begin{array}{rcl} P(F1,J2|{\\rm replace}) &=& \\frac{N_F}{N_C} \\cdot \\frac{N_J}{N_C} \\end{array} $$ Without replacement $$ \\begin{array}{rcl} P(F1,J2|{\\rm no-replace}) &=& P(F1) \\times P(J2|F1) \\\\ &=&\\frac{N_F}{N_C} \\times \\left(P(J2|F1,J1)P(J1|F1)+P(J2|F1,\\overline{J1})P(\\overline{J1}|F1)\\right)\\\\ &=&\\frac{N_F}{N_C} \\times \\left( \\frac{N_J-1}{N_C-1}\\cdot \\frac{N_{JF}}{N_F} + \\frac{N_J}{N_C-1}\\cdot \\frac{N_F-N_{JF}}{N_F} \\right) \\end{array} $$ Solving When these two expressions are the same, we have: $$ \\begin{array}{rcl} \\frac{N_F}{N_C} \\cdot \\frac{N_J}{N_C}&=&\\frac{N_F}{N_C} \\times \\left( \\frac{N_J-1}{N_C-1}\\cdot \\frac{N_{JF}}{N_F} + \\frac{N_J}{N_C-1}\\cdot \\frac{N_F-N_{JF}}{N_F} \\right) \\end{array} $$ which, believe it or not, simplifies to $$ \\begin{array}{rcl} N_F/N_C &=& N_{JF}/N_J \\end{array} $$ or, in other words, for the replacement and non-replacement probabilities to be the same in this simple game, the fraction of the subpopulation to the deck has to be the same fraction as the jacks in that subpopulation to the number of jacks. In the case of color, 1/2 the deck is black and 1/2 the jacks are black. However, 3/13 of the deck are face cards and 4/4 of the jacks are face cards. An interesting symmetry. Essentially, when there exists this symmetry, knowledge of the first draw gives you no information about the second. I imagine there is some fancy math theorem to this effect, but it is still pretty cool.","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Mar/25/a-funny-little-probability-problem-some-closure/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Mar/25/a-funny-little-probability-problem-some-closure/"},{"title":"A funny little probability problem - correct","text":"Introduction In a previous post I made a calculation error, which arrived at an unintuitive result - a result that still stands. I got side-tracked with, what I thought, was an arithmetic error. I wasn't satisfied, because my intuition still thought that the without-replacement probability should be a smidge higher, because of the reduction in the number of cards. Because of this, I kept thinking about the problem to see where it went wrong. I asked another faculty member the same question, and although I didn't receive a full answer, it was enough to figure out that I was on the right track initially, but was just a little sloppy. So what went wrong, and why? Let me reproduce the problem, and the correct calculation this time, and then go on to see the implications of the error. The problem You draw two cards from a deck, and ask what is the probability that the first is a black card, and the second is a jack. In math notation, we want: $$ P(B1,J2) $$ The right answer, and how I know The easiest way to be absolutely sure I had the right answer is to simply outline every possible two-hand deal, and count the number of cards in each case. With replacement: from Game import * deals = [] deck = makedeck () for card1 in deck : deck2 = makedeck () for card2 in deck2 : deals . append ([ card1 , card2 ]) found = [ x for x in deals if x [ 0 ] . color == 'Black' and x [ 1 ] . rank == 11 ] The length of \"found\" is 104, and the length of the \"deals\" is 2704 (52 x 52). Without replacement: from Game import * deals = [] deck = makedeck () for card1 in deck : deck2 = makedeck () deck2 . remove ( card1 ) # <------ remove the card for card2 in deck2 : deals . append ([ card1 , card2 ]) found = [ x for x in deals if x [ 0 ] . color == 'Black' and x [ 1 ] . rank == 11 ] The length of \"found\" is 102, and the length of the \"deals\" is 2652 (52 x 51), which is the same fraction. With replacement This part was correct, and just repeated here. In replacement, we replace the first card after drawing it, reshuffle, and then draw the second. Thus the two events are independent. $$ \\begin{array}{rcl} P(B1,J2|{\\rm replace}) &=& P(B1) \\times P(J2) \\\\ &=&\\frac{26}{52} \\times \\frac{4}{52} = \\frac{104}{2704}=0.0385 \\end{array} $$ Without replacement $$ \\begin{array}{rcl} P(B1,J2|{\\rm no-replace}) &=& P(B1) \\times P(J2|B1) \\\\ &=&\\frac{26}{52} \\times \\left(P(J2|B1,J1)\\underline{P(J1|B1)}+P(J2|B1,\\overline{J1})\\underline{P(\\overline{J1}|B1)}\\right)\\\\ &=&\\frac{26}{52} \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{51} \\cdot \\underline{\\frac{2}{26}}+\\frac{4}{51} \\cdot \\underline{\\frac{24}{26}} \\right)\\\\ &=&\\frac{26}{52} \\times \\underline{\\left(\\frac{102}{51\\cdot 26} \\right)}\\\\ &=&\\frac{102}{2652}\\\\ &=&0.0385 \\end{array} $$ where I have put boxes, or underline, around where I differ from the previous calculation. The difference The difference comes from the term like: $$ P(J2|B1,J1)P(J1|B1) $$ In the incorrect version, we had $$ P(J2|B1,J1)P(J1) $$ Essentially, I was being sloppy, and forgot to copy the right-hand side of the conditional, without the B1 . What I find interesting, which is why I've gone to such a detail, are the following: how easy it is to make simple arithmetic mistakes in these sorts of problems how easy it is to have a subtle rewrite of a problem, and get a different answer how a simulation gives a lot of confidence in a result I've found, over time, that I don't tend to trust mathematical results without a numerical result to support it. Still, it is a cool result, and still somewhat unintuitive - at least at first. Thinking in terms of information, it makes sense - knowing that the first card is black tells you nothing about the rank of the second card.","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Mar/23/a-funny-little-probability-problem-correct/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Mar/23/a-funny-little-probability-problem-correct/"},{"title":"A funny little probability problem","text":"(Note: this problem has an error...can you find it?

Clearly, if you draw a Jack, then the probability of drawing another Jack is different whether you replace and shuffle, or you leave the drawn Jack out. In an extreme case, imagine a deck with only one Jack. After going through an example in class, and applying replacement, a student asked about the same example without replacement. I didn't have time to go over the example in class, but I sketched how the calculation would be different, and would yield a different answer.

The second basic flaw is that it may not be a well-defined question. What does \"absolute\" really mean? What about \"truth\"? We have working definitions, which might be a bit sloppy, but perhaps if we understood them better we'd find that they are not well defined concepts. An analogy in physics might be the word \"particle\". We have a working definition, and in most cases it is very usable, but we know that fundamentally we just have energy and interactions - the particle is a convenient construct.

Agnostic sceptic Stephen Pilcher believes that Christian claims to healing are tricks of the mind. Can John Ryeland of the Christian Healing Mission persuade him differently? Also features personal stories from people who claim to have been miraculously healed. Download mp3. Justin Brierley - Christian Moderator John Ryeland - Christian Heather Riley - Christian Stephen Pilcher - Agnostic Notes Stephen - \"I'm a church-going, Bible-reading agnostic\" Me - That's pretty funny, because it is very close to what I am. I am a church-going, Bible-reading atheist. Although I have read the Bible at least once cover-to-cover a few years ago, I have lost patience with reading it now. There is so much repetitious and tedious material, both Old and New Testament, that I find it hard to read for long without thinking I have better things to do with my time. Stephen - There are a large number of \"miracles\" that aren't miracles at all, and non-Christians can have healings as well. Heather - Her story is at 24:40, in case you want to listen to the original. Here is a quick summary. She pursued a psychology degree, studied the paranormal. About 3 or 4 months ago, she went to a chiropodist (aka podiatrist) who told her that one leg was longer than another (by an inch). She then went, unplanned, to a religious gathering. During the meeting the preacher gave her some very specific information about he from several years ago, some comforting words, and a moving message. And then he healed the asymmetric leg. She said she felt like she was \"on show\" and that \"God's really got to do something\" . She also said that she didn't feel any different, but a friend of hers observing saw the leg lengthening. So then she went back to the chiropodist. She determined he was Christian, told the entire story, he repeated the measurement and then did some more robust measurements, and found no difference in leg length. And since then, her shoes are no longer asymmetric. Stephen - People have done studies of faith healings and always come up short. Me - When I first heard that story, a year or so ago when I first listened to this episode, I recall being pretty impressed with the healing. Since then, after much reading, and hearing this again I am not. (It is interesting that I recall it being more impressive, and if I never heard the story again, might have started to spread a more impressive story if I told it again. This is a nice reminder of how these stories, working with the limitations of memory, can grow in the telling and quickly become unfactual). Anyway, why am I not impressed? There are a number of little details that she dropped in that I find curious. Consider two models (there are probably more!): There is a God, and he decides to heal this leg, but not other ailments, and not her husbands problems. This is hard to reconcile even on the face of it, and later in the show she talks about this somewhat. There is no God, these things don't happen, and there are other mundane explanations Turns out that leg-lengthening is a very common form of \"healing\" in these sorts of situations (see \"The Faith Healers\" by James Randi), because it looks impressive and is a straightforward trick. That's why it is important to have magicians as well as scientists investigate such claims, because scientists are terrible at detecting dishonesty and trickery. The fact that she had no idea that one leg was longer, until a few days before, that she did not feel the healing, and only went on the word of the friend because she was expecting something to happen, that she was impressed with the \"prophecy\" that the preacher said, referring to things he would have no idea about. James Randi speaks about this at length, and shows how preachers will use planted people, microphones, and other techniques to appear to know things they wouldn't already know. Even if they aren't being deceptive, they may hear in conversations with the friends ahead of time about Heather's problems, and then work it into the \"prophecy\" . When she goes back to the chiropodist she finds out he is a Christian, and before he redoes the measurement she tells the story. Now, this chiropodist has a vested interest in confirming the healing, because it will confirm his worldview. This is why we have double-blind measurements, because we know people bias the measurement, the reporting, the memory of it because of their worldview. In fact, she tells that the chiropodist had to do more robust measurements to confirm the equal leg length. Perhaps there was an error in the first measurement. Perhaps the first measurement was overestimated. Perhaps it wasn't, and she reported it rounding up (i.e. he says a bit more than 1/2 inch, she tells her friends around an inch, and then remembers it as such, etc...). Perhaps the equipment for the first test has a bias, which might have motivated him to make the more robust measurements. There are many possibilities that do not require dishonesty, deliberate deception, incompetence, and are completely mundane. So which model can explain each of these? It seems clear to me that there are perfectly good mundane explanations for nearly every detail of the story, that the story is inconsistent even with a \"real\" healing, and that model 2 is definitely better. What about her asymmetric shoes, and the pain that occured and went away after a while after the \"healing\" ? My shoes tend to get asymmetric over time (not with each other, but each pushed off to the outside) and when I get new shoes, and they are flat, I have a little pain walking and running that goes away as I adjust. Notice that these events happened 3 or 4 months ago . There is no way that her new shoes would have become asymmetric in that time anyway . John - \"There is an awful lot of anecdotal evidence, and I don't want to be skeptical of it simply because it is not documented. What else....is she not telling the truth? Of course she's telling the truth!\" Me - All we need is a slightly overzealous preacher, a slightly sloppy chiropodist, and a small amount of congitive bias. It really is that simple, and it doesn't require us to disparage the character of anyone in the story. John - \"How high should we set the bar to know that this is a proper healing story?\" John - \"For some people they want to make it so hard to call it a miracle that nothing could ever satisfy that. I want to take Heather's story, listen to it, and ask 'How did it change her'? If it is a story, told with integrety, seems to have a lasting effect, of course it would be better if it were documented, but we don't have the ability to get the documentation.\" Me - I listen to this talk about documentation, and about how it's \"so hard \", some people are \"so skeptical\" and I have to think \"cry baby, cry baby, cry baby\" . I even hear the little whining voice in my head. \"People should be more believing of my miracle claims\" , \"You're being too skeptical\" , etc... Of course, when it comes to other people's miracle claims, they are just as skeptical! It's only the ones that support their worldview that they consider for special treatment. Sorry, that's not good enough. Even Heather points this out, saying that she feels that people are more skeptical of religious claims than claims of the paranormal (which she saw in her studies of the paranormal). She's noting, in others, the same thing she is doing with her worldview. I've posted specifically about this problem here . In science, say you are trying to publish a paper, and the editor or reviewer returns it saying that they are not convinced of your conclusions, you don't go \"Oh, you're being too hard on me, too skeptical. Getting the documentation for this effect I am claiming exists is just too hard.\" That is just ridiculous. You find a way to document it, with careful measurements, and you convince the skeptics if it is true, or not if it is false. Truth should convince even the skeptics, especially if you're claiming a large effect. Take the Higgs boson, as an example of an unseen entity for which we only can get indirect inference of its existence. It was proposed 50 years ago , and although people may have thought it was likely to be there, they didn't believe it was there until the proper measurements were done. Measurements which took decades to set up, required hundreds of people as a team, and has cost billions of dollars, just to get the documentation for the existence of something which doesn't even seem to violate physical law. Think about that next time you hear someone claim that getting documentation for healing is hard, or that the effect seems to disappear whenever you look into it carefully, and that is the reason there isn't any evidence for it. If the claimed effects of so-called faith-healings are real, they should be trivial to demonstrate, document, and convince the skeptics.","tags":"Unbelievable Project","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Mar/18/unbelievable-project-miracles-and-healing-is-it-evidence-for-the-truth-of-christianity/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Mar/18/unbelievable-project-miracles-and-healing-is-it-evidence-for-the-truth-of-christianity/"},{"title":"Unbelievable Project: A \"proxy\" atheist explains why he can't believe","text":"Unbelievable? 10 Nov 2007 - A \"proxy\" atheist explains why he can't believe - 10 November 2007 -- Radio Host Nick Pandolfi on being a 'proxy atheist' As part of the Unbelievable Project , I am taking notes and \"arm-chair\" responding to each of the Unbelievable podcast episodes satisfying a set of simple rules .

Justin Brierley - Christian Moderator Peter Williams - Christian Nick Pandolfi - Atheist Notes Nick - (from his article, quote read by Justin) \"Religion can be what you want it to be. A pick-and-mix victorious sponge God, or a full blown hate-making factory. These religious folk don't exactly get on, do they? How does religion explain its catastrophic failing to get on with itself? No wonder people like me feel let down.\" Me - I've heard it as \"The Big Book of Multiple Choice\" . An analogy would be with simple proverbs (not the Biblical ones, although it might work there). For any proverb, you can almost always find an opposite. Consider the following two pairs: \"Haste makes waste\", \"A stitch in time saves nine\" \"Too many cooks spoil the broth\", \"Many hands make light work\" Me - Each of these is correct, in some context, but we are are responsible for following the correct edict in the correct context. We do this naturally, and people who read the Bible do this too - they just don't realize that it is they who are making the moral choices, not simply following the moral edicts of the Bible. Nick - I find some atheists as ranting as some religious folks, and I don't want to join that band. Hitting themselves all the time, moaning about \"Christmas being stolen\" , or \"Christmas doesn't exist\" , \"I don't believe in this\" , and \"I don't believe in that\" . Me - I'm with him there. Sometimes I think it goes a bit overboard. However, when it comes to public funds being spent on religious iconography, I have a problem. Things like the ten commandments in judicial halls, or official school prayers in public schools. Nick - There is a lot of anger there, with Dawkins and Hitchens, etc... and that's just not where he is. He feels it is unlikely for there to be a God but that he doesn't know, that he can't know, but he also doesn't want to go the other way to claim that there is a God. Me - this, to me, is atheism pure and simple, and I think that he is really missing the definitions. even Dawkins would never say he knows there is no God. Nick - I do believe that many people perhaps misrepresent faith or perhaps misrepresent their God, but to me behave in a way that does not seem particularly religious. Peter - The fact that people do a lot of evil highlights one of the truths that religion claims about the world that people are sinful and that they need some kind of help to deal with that. Nick - Religious people should know better, shouldn't they? Peter - One should distinguish between people who do bad things against the grain of what their theology teaches them vs people who do bad things along the line of the ideology they follow. What would happen if people followed Jesus' word seriously? Killing people is clearly against the grain of what Jesus had in mind. Peter - If you really follow Jesus, turn the other cheek, love your enemy then the evil things shouldn't happen. Nick - that's a great \"Get out of jail free\" card - if you follow the rule book, then it won't happen. But it happens , has happened for far too long, and will continue to happen. Me- On the \"Get out of jail free\" , I am in full agreement. This is the \"no true Christian\" fallacy. If you claim to be a Christian, and are good, then you're a real Christian. If you're not, you're not really a Christian. Peter - this is not particular to religion, people who are irreligious have done it, etc... Nick - But you're bigger than politics, you're religion , you're supposed to be better, you're supposed to be the shining light example. Me - I think Nick might be using the word \"religious\" in a way that his host, and discussion partner, is not seeing. I think, if I can speak for him, he means that religion claims the moral high ground. As such, we should perhaps hold religious people to a higher standard. For example, the pedophilia in the Catholic Church is a horrible thing. It is that much worse given that the people involved claim to be morally superior to others. When Nick says that religion should \"know better\" , I think this is referring to the self-proclaimed moral superiority of their religion over others in contract to the actions of those making that claim. Nick - if you join a club, you pay your dues, and there are a certain set of rules for that club to remain in the club. there are certain definite rules for religious life, but the church will gladly take your money so you can have your wedding there. they'll take your cash, regardless of whether you will ever go back to that church again. Nick - to respect an organization, you need to believe that they believe in what they are selling. If you are going to have anyone through your doors, whether they know anything about Jesus for example, but take their money for weddings this is hypocritical. I would respect a church a lot more if they would test people. Me - Yes, I agree. There is a hypocrisy in the churches, and in the people, who want the benefits of calling themselves Christian when it comes to baptism, weddings, and funerals (Hatched, Matched, and Dispatched), but do not believe in the tennets of the church. Back to Peter's comment - What would happen if people followed Jesus' word seriously? Me - I doubt that Peter really takes Jesus' words seriously. For example, Matt 19:20 \"Jesus answered, \"If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.\" \" and Matt 5:18 \"For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.\" which pulls in all of those crazy Old Testament \"kill you for this and that\" commands. Surely Peter will have some rationalization for not following these, and also not recognize the process by which he came by these rationalizations. He probably would not admit that he is the arbiter of these choices, not the Bible.","tags":"Unbelievable Project","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Mar/15/unbelievable-project-a-proxy-atheist-explains-why-he-cant-believe/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Mar/15/unbelievable-project-a-proxy-atheist-explains-why-he-cant-believe/"},{"title":"Unbelievable Project: The \"New Atheism\" - Barry Duke and David Marshall Debate","text":"The New Atheism - 03 November 2007 -- The \"New Atheism\" - Barry Duke and David Marshall Debate As part of the Unbelievable Project , I am taking notes and \"arm-chair\" responding to each of the Unbelievable podcast episodes satisfying a set of simple rules .

Description of Episode Full Title: Unbelievable? 3 Nov 2007 - The New Atheism - 03 November 2007 -- The \"New Atheism\" - Barry Duke and David Marshall Debate Christianity is under attack as never before by a wave of militant atheists, led by Richard Dawkins. Atheist Barry Duke is all in favour of it, while Christian David Marshall's book \"The Truth behind the new Atheism\" rejects it. They join Justin on the show as he asks whether Christianity is really as bad as the New Atheists are making out. Download mp3. Justin Brierley - Christian Moderator David Marshall - Christian Barry Duke - Atheist Gordon Livesey - Atheist Notes Barry - There is nothing new about the atheism. What is new is the response. This is partly because of 9/11. This event made people realize what some people would do for their religion. And partly because of the perception that the US was hijacked by a fundamentalist and given power through the neo-cons. David - Critical of evolution on social development of religion. Dennett believes that if you can explain religion then you can \"explain it away\" . Me - What is the difference between explaining something and explaining it away? I'd say this is just model-comparison with different words. When you have something, like a UFO sighting, and then someone explains it with mundane events, like a trick of the lights, that is typically described as explaining it away - you've replaced an extraordinary explanation with one that is more plausible. This is what Dennett typically does - he demonstrates a more plausible description of how certain religious behaviors and experiences can arise from more mundane phenomena. In this way, explaining it is explaining it \"away\". It's just that people who believe the extraordinary explanation don't like the mundane explanation, so the term \"explaining away\" has negative connotations for them. Justin - Religion more harm than good? That attitude seems to be new. Also, this \"militant atheism \". Is it just against fundamentalism? Me - When I hear the term \"militant atheist\" I can't help but think of this cartoon . If you campare what you think of with the term \"Miltant Islamist\" with \"Militant Atheist\" , it is quite clear there is a double-standard at work. The only \"militant\" part of atheists, even the most dogmatic ones, is that they have forceful arguments. Barry - No. There is a general feeling that enough is enough or we will get railroaded by religion in government, education, etc... The new atheists want to galvanize those people who are effectively non-believers, bring them to the stand and we can then effect political change. David - It's ironic not to have religion in the marketplace of ideas or in education. The university was a religious idea itself. Christianity has informed society mostly for the good. Separation of church and state is a Christian idea. Me - I believe he is referring to Mark 12:17 - \"Then Jesus said to them, \"Give back to Caesar what is Caesar's and to God what is God's.\" And they were amazed at him.\" . There is a long way from that to \"separation of church and state\" . If the separation was truly was a Christian idea, then I'd expect a totally different European history from 0 AD to 1700 AD! What a ridiculous claim. Barry - Slavery was supported by Christians and then brought down by some Christians. David - Slavery is a natural idea and has been part of nearly all civilizations. Christians have undermined slavery from early on, not directly but indirectly. Beginning in the fourth century slaves were set free so that by the eleventh century there were areas of western Europe free of slaves. This was not imposed on the rest of society. Sixty percent of anti-slave organizers were Christian pastors. Me - It is faint praise indeed that the best you can say about the Christian stance on slavery, historically, is that some slaves were freed so that 700 years later (!!!) some small areas in the world, that didn't feel that they needed slaves anymore, didn't have slaves. Again, the Bible is quite clear on its perspective with respect to slavery - it either commands it or condones it, both Old and New Testament. There is never even a hint of condemnation for the practice. Gordon - Concerns about Intelligent Design (ID) in the classroom David - The ID people just want to have an open forum to discuss their ideas and that it is legitimate to question scientific ideas, even parts of evolution. That ID isn't a problem most of the time, the issues often exaggerated. I don't see it as standing in the way of any science or progress currently. Me- David's view of ID is completely at odds with the facts on the ground about the movement. The clearest description of this was the Judges ruling in the Dover PA case . Here ID had a chance to present its best arguments to a jury, and was found wanting at every level. From the Wikipedia page : \"The ruling concluded that intelligent design is not science, and permanently barred the board from \"maintaining the ID Policy in any school within the Dover Area School District, from requiring teachers to denigrate or disparage the scientific theory of evolution, and from requiring teachers to refer to a religious, alternative theory known as ID.\"\" The full ruling showed the ID proponents for what they are: a group of people who do not shirk from lying and distortions to achieve their religious-motivated goals. Justin. Do you believe that raising a child as religious is child abuse? Barry. There are rare cases where this is definitely a problem. In my own case I was beaten in South Africa for not participating in Christian rituals. Gordon. My daughteer is six years old, and was upset one day when she was told off by a teacher. She said \"We all have to say grace, and I didn't say it.\" Then the lady in the lunch room pushed her head down and said \"Say your prayers!\" David. Entirely on Barry and Gordon's side. However, in the US it has been shown that going to church makes people in ghettos less likely in crime. Yes, there are people who use Christianity to abuse people, but this goes against what the gospels say. Me - I certainly would not call all religious education \"child abuse\" . Corporal punishment (Biblically motivated, or otherwise), yes. Psychological torture (Biblically motivated, or otherwise), yes. Raising a child to call themselves Christian, not. As for the benefits, I am interested in the truth. I imagine that the reduced-crime benefits described would come from any kind of group membership, regardless of its religious or secular affiliation. It does not speak to the specific truth of Christianity.","tags":"Unbelievable Project","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Mar/13/unbelievable-project-the-new-atheism-barry-duke-and-david-marshall-debate/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Mar/13/unbelievable-project-the-new-atheism-barry-duke-and-david-marshall-debate/"},{"title":"Unbelievable Project: John Lennox debates science and God - Has science buried God?","text":"10/13/07 - John Lennox debates science and God - Has science buried God?

Fresh from a US TV debate with Richard Dawkins, Oxford Professor Dr. John Lennox engages with atheist scientist Robert Stovold. Lennox, who is a Christian, asserts in his book \"God's Undertaker - Has science buried God?\" that science and philosophy show evidence of a divine designer. Robert Stovold says the methodology of science is incompatible with such belief. Download mp3. Justin Brierley - Christian Moderator John Lennox - Christian Robert Stovold - Atheist Notes Me - this episode was a lot of work, because both debaters were very strong and the density of information in this episode is very high - a lot of information per minute. I had to go back and listen to parts many times. I particularly like Robert's style - he is very calm and straightforward, never sounding angry or aggressive. I highly recommend you listen to the entire debate, because I won't be able to cover everything here. Robert - A common theistic line of argument refers to the appearance of design, and states things like \"the eye cannot occur by chance\". If you think evolution is about randomness, then you don't understand evolution. If you drop a fish and a lion and drop them on the ground, it is not random which one will survive, and it doesn't require design to explain this. Robert - In the Bible \"Love\" is defined, both in the Old and New Testament, in such a way that it always prevails, and always helps. Then, with 99% of the species that ever existed being extinct, this is not consistent with a loving God. All of this suffering happened well before any humans, and Fall, or Noah's flood. John - This is the problem of theodicy. What I would be curious about is where you even get the idea of right and wrong, because under atheism, there can be no objective moral standard. Me - at this point I was jumping up a screaming. Dodge! Dodge! I'd heard this dodge before, and essentially it ignores the force of the argument. Robert followed up well, but then added some comments about where an atheistic morality (as a social construct) comes from. This derailed the conversation and John never addressed the point. The point is that, if we assume the Bible is true, then the problem of suffering, as evidenced by the inefficient and wasteful methods of evolution, leads to a conflict with a loving God. I don't have to even believe that evil and good exist to make this argument - it is a \"spin out the consequences\" of a worldview and show a conflict. Robert describes very well how evolution gives the appearance of design - instead of nudging things in the right direction, evolution nudges things in \"all\" directions and the kills off the directions that don't work. Robert - the war is between naturalism and supernaturalism not between atheism and God. science ascribes natural causes to natural effects (methodological naturalism). It isn't that science assumes God doesn't exist, it simply doesn't include supernatural explanations. John - methodological naturalism is the same as methodological theism. Dawkins says the world is apparently designed, I say it is designed. It is only in certain areas, not 99.5% of science, that it makes any difference. there are good gaps and bad gaps. bad gaps are gaps that science can close. methodological naturalism is ok but it stops you when the evidence points beyond naturalism. Two \"good gaps\" I would say are the origin of the universe and the origin of life. Me - I'd bet real money that the origin of life is a \"bad gap\", from John's perspective. In every case where we had a thorny science problem that seemed insoluble, and we had to resort to \"magic\" (i.e. this lovely cartoon ), eventually we have solved it. The origin of life seems exactly that sort of thing that is amenable to solution. As a problem, it doesn't suffer from the infinite regress issues from which origin of the universe solutions can suffer. John - in science it is often very difficult to prove a negative, although there are cases where (within a reasonable doubt) we can do that. when I receive a paper outlining in 100 pages a design for a perpetual motion machine, I don't need to read it. Not because I'm being an abscurantist, but because the conservation of energy (a \"pro-scriptive law\" ) is a principle that has been demonstrated to be true in all cases, within a reasonably doubt. Now, Sir Peter Meadower has proposed a conservation of information. nature is very good at transmitting information, processing and optimizing as is done in microevolution. where I have difficulty is with the creative process - those natural processes cannot create information. Me - This is one of the cases where John makes a fundamental science mistake [see comment below for correction/clarification on this], and tips his hand to his agenda. In a line, perpetual motion machines do not violate conservation of energy. They violate the second law of thermodynamics. Such a basic science error, in my view, disqualifies his entire scientific credibility - I can't trust that his other scientific claims, even if I may not have time to track them all down. Also, in a fit of irony, he then goes on to talk about information which is intricately linked to the second law. It is absolutely not true that natural processes produce no new information. For example, the natural development of nylonase is a good example within our lifetime - bacteria evolved a new enzyme to specifically break down the completely artificial substance known as nylon. Just as a the formation of ice moves water from a disordered to a more ordered state, the process of natural selection moves species to a ordered state -- more in-line with the environment. Information production, i.e. entropy reduction, happens all of the time in the natural world. John - I believe that the fact that the universe is rationally intelligible is evidence for God. Atheism has no explanation for it, but theism does. Thus, support for God comes from the bits of science that we do know and not the bits we don't. He is amazed that scientists stop short of the most important question, simply calling it a brute fact. Me - What is the alternative? Any universe with sustained structures should be intelligible. A non-intelligible universe would be one with no patterns - completely random, and thus no structure would ever form. There is no way we could be thinking beings in an unintelligible universe. It is also possible that one could not even have an object that one could label a \"universe\" without it being intelligible. ** John - Reductionism undermines the notion of inteligibility. Intelligibility demands an explanation. \"I don't bring god into science, [...] science points to god in its very existence\" John - On the fine tuning argument, the constants of nature have to be within very close tolerances to get carbon based life. An easier example is more local. Taking the Earth, if the Earth were spinning faster we'd all fly off, if slower then we'd all bake to death. If we were too close to the Sun, it'd be too hot, too far and it's too cold. These things have to be in very close tolerances. The standard Find Tuning observation takes this to the Nth degree. This is not an argument from gaps, its from our knowledge. Robert. Theists are trying to have it both ways. On the one hand God's goal is to create life and on the other hand if it had been slightly different then life wouldn't be possible. Life's very rare. Imagine a patio with weeds in the cracks. The weeds would say that the cracks were put there to support them, ignoring the rest of the patio. Robert. As for fine tuning, we don't know if the constants are twiddle-able. Theists will have an explanation either way. If they are twiddle-able then God was so good to twiddle them correctly. If not, then the argument would be that God knew what he wanted and dint need to make a university with changeable constants. Most theistic arguments are like this - you can explain anything, and thus explain nothing. Lennox. Most scientists respond that the fine tuning does require an explanation, and often put forward the multiverse explanation even though there is not a shred of evidence for it. The theistic explanation is the obvious one that everyone admits, but then they try to come up with another explanation. Robert - once you abandon the law of cause and effect, you can't do science. Me - I agree with Robert the whole way here. I would add, however, that it may be the case that these constants are in fact not independent . Many physicists will state that they are independent, because in current theory they are, but they may not be in some future theory. Thus, it might be that not only are they not twiddle-able but they might not be separately twiddle-able, and thus life may be possible in all possible universes. Finally, as an analogy, if we look at pre-Copernican astronomy with all of the epicycles on epicycles, a scientist at that time would find it very difficult to fathom that all of that independent detail could be derived from two equations (Newton's 3rd Law, and the theory of gravitation). Another analogy would be the independent spectral lines of each type of material, used in the 1800's for spectroscopy, being explained by the single Schoedinger equation! We have many examples of so-called independent observations not actually being independent when we have a full understanding.","tags":"Unbelievable Project","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Mar/11/unbelievable-project-john-lennox-debates-science-and-god-has-science-buried-god/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Mar/11/unbelievable-project-john-lennox-debates-science-and-god-has-science-buried-god/"},{"title":"Unbelievable Project: God Delusion debate - Deluded by Dawkins?","text":"8/24/07 - God Delusion debate - Deluded by Dawkins?

Andrew Wilson's new book claims to have debunked Richard Dawkins' arguments against God. He goes head to head with atheist Gordon Livesey as they discuss The God Delusion and whether people are really being deluded by Dawkins' arguments. Download mp3. Justin Brierley - Christian Moderator Andrew Wilson - Christian Gordon Livesey - Atheist Notes Andrew - many things I agree with Dawkins. Religions should debate their points, and not be immune from criticism. I agree with his criticisms of extreme versions of Christianity, although it seems as if Dawkins goes out of his way to find the most extreme and illiterate unconvincing examples of religious conviction. Andrew- problems, 1. implied trajectory of religiosity 2. stridency of the book Me - 35 minutes into the show so far, and there hasn't been an actual challenge to a claim of Dawkins. Only criticisms of tone, and perceived insinuation. I find this is typical of many of the criticisms of the \"New Atheists\" - people complain about the tone, and not the actual content of the arguments. I find it helpful to focus on the actual claims, and not the tone. Everything else is a distraction. Gordon - one of the strong statements of Dawkins is on the subject of theology, which he says really isn't a subject at all. it is not based on science, and is simply based on old texts. Dawkins relates a story where the physics professor, when asked about what started the Big Bang, threw a sop to the theologian and suggested that the chaplain would be better able to answer. Dawkins' response was like, \"Why would the chaplain know anything about this? Surely a physics professor should know more. \" Andrew - that explains a lot. if you don't have any respect for a field, then you will be much less likely to read the actual work, and will make errors (Dawkins mistakes Matthew for Luke when relaying the wise men story, mistaken on a contradiction of the birthplace stated in Matthew and Luke, mistaken on Thomas Jefferson referring to the Dead Sea Scrolls, etc...) Andrew - We can ask questions like, why did the jews of the first century which didn't believe in the two stage resurrection start referring to Jesus' resurrection? There might be secular responses to questions like that, but we have to take them seriously and not simply dismiss them. Me - That's history, not theology. Gordon - theology just doesn't stand up when compared to physics, chemistry, history, etc... Andrew - anti-supernaturalism perspectives, by definition, cannot have any miracles. origins, infinite improbability of god. Me - I don't think that Andrew understands Dawkins' argument for the improbability of God. Essentially, any probability that you assign for the the universe because of its complexity must be greater than the probability you assign for the necessarily more complex creator of the universe. Gordon - I do believe that miracles could not happen, and they never have. Much that was attributed to miracles is explained by science. Andrew - Lack of belief in miracles is not new. Some say in the New Testament, that the people who believed in the Resurrection were mad. Dawkins implies that Hume put the death nail in. Andrew - an atheist friend said \"If I accepted that miracles occur, then I'd have to change the entire way I view the physical world\" (this is in response to a story of a miraculous healing of a women's hearing at a prayer meeting). Dawkins is the same way - he is just unwilling to believe. Gordon - No, Dawkins doesn't say this - he always insists that if you can show him good evidence, then he'd believe. Justin - but whatever evidence you bring forward, that looks just like a miracle, Dawkins will write off that there must be an alternative explanation. Gordon - he's going on previous evidence, making further miracle claims unlikely. Andrew - Some people made some wrong claims about X, therefore X cannot be true. (Gordon - unlikely to be true) Some people made up a ridiculous story of a \"miracle\" of an elephant drinking milk, therefore miracles cannot happen, therefore the Resurrection didn't happen, therefore there is no God - shaky foundation. We should look at at the historical evidence, without prohibition against miracles. Andrew - I don't assume the Resurrection. I don't assume miracles, but I have seen healings, so I believe based on the evidence. We should be open to miracles as an explanation, and not dismiss them entirely \"by definition\" . Me - I think that we have to separate the idea of an observed phenomenon and the cause of that phenomenon, to be clear. When saying \"miracle\" we conflate the two. We can possibly test an effect, even if we can't test a supernatural cause. A number of examples were discussed, mostly faith healings. Now, I believe that Andrew would agree that not all miracle claims are true, and not all faith healings are legitimate. The question then becomes, how can we tell the difference between true and false claims? How are false claims produced? The way we can tell is if we can repeat them, or have some independent verification. Every attempt I have ever seen to carefully study faith healings has come up empty. Now, some diseases can disappear on their own or have completely subjective symptoms. Other diseases cannot - missing limbs, removed/damaged organs, etc... There is not a single case of a regrown limb or organ in all of the faith healing literature. Every case is indistinguishable from no effect. Take, for example, the story of the suddenly hearing woman. How do we know that her hearing didn't come back the previous week, and she only pointed it out at the healing mass? How do we know that she had actually lost her hearing? This could easily be the case of a pious fraud - she interprets an increase in hearing around the time of a prayer meeting to being caused by the prayer meeting. It could easily have been fabricated too. How could we distinguish these explanations? The only way is through objectively obtained evidence, the exact kind that we do not have in any of these cases. Here's a suggestion - I'd be convinced of a miracle if it can pass the JREF test . Since none have, I am well within my rational grounds to immediately dismiss any such claims as miraculous until such time as they pony up the evidence.","tags":"Unbelievable Project","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Mar/08/unbelievable-project-god-delusion-debate-deluded-by-dawkins/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Mar/08/unbelievable-project-god-delusion-debate-deluded-by-dawkins/"},{"title":"Unbelievable Project: Atheist and Christian bloggers discuss","text":"As part of the Unbelievable Project , I am taking notes and \"arm-chair\" responding to each of the Unbelievable podcast episodes satisfying a set of simple rules .

Jenni - Jesus as an icon (like clicking Excel - it leads to you to Excel). It is easier to be good when one is in a community , get support, etc... Also one should take the lesson from Jesus, and not act superior or shun those that are sinful but engage them in dialog and offer help. Me - religions have had hundreds of years of constructing communities and support structures that just aren't there for atheists. humans need community, and you get a lot of those benefits from being in a religious community. Justin - I believe that we have an innate selfishness. Theologically we attribute this to the Fall, and it comes out very early on. Hopefully society helps to inculcate us with some values, but it does seem as if this selfishness is getting worse. What's the solution to that? Can we help ourselves, or do we need someone else? I would say that as a Christian that Jesus Christ is what makes the difference, that's where you have a hope of seeing change. Me - It might turn out that, for some people, they need to believe that there is someone there even when the isn't anyone there. This, however, does not speak to the truth of it. I'd ask, would a Christian have the same positive attitude if you replace Jesus Christ in the above with Allah - would you be supportive of more Islam in your community, because of the positive influence it has on youth, turning them around, because they come to recognize the power of Allah? It seems to me that this is another case of \"if you agree with me, I want more of you, otherwise, no thanks.\" Perhaps, knowing this about human psychology, we could figure out a way of getting the benefits without all of the superstitious nonsense.","tags":"Unbelievable Project","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Mar/06/unbelievable-project-atheist-and-christian-bloggers-discuss/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Mar/06/unbelievable-project-atheist-and-christian-bloggers-discuss/"},{"title":"Unbelievable Project: God's existence, free will and faith - The Big Questions","text":"6/22/07 - God's existence, free will and faith - The Big Questions As part of the Unbelievable Project , I am taking notes and \"arm-chair\" responding to each of the Unbelievable podcast episodes satisfying a set of simple rules .

Justin Brierley - Christian Moderator Jonathan Hill, Jonathan, Tim Mawson, Jim Paul - Christian (none) - Atheist Notes Tim - personal experience can be evidence for God's existence, like the perception of a table is evidence of a table. it's a phenomenon, although it can be tricky to map it to reality. Me - the idea is one of verifiability, which distinguishes these sorts of things. Tim points out that many have had personal experiences to verify other religions. This, in a single stroke, eliminates it as a reasonable form of evidence. Jonathan - three biggies historically. cosmological - God must exist because the Universe must have a cause. , God is by definition uncaused, a necessary being. the universe could have not existed (nothing), or a different one, so it is contingent. this must come from a necessary being. - I'm not very convinced of arguments of this kind - it doesn't really prove God, but some \"first thing\" Me - I agree! however, I am not convinced with this contingent, necessary distinction. can we demonstrate it? Can we find an example? Is it a meaningful distinction? Jonathan - teleological - argument from design. quotes from Marcus Minucius Felix late 2nd century \"hold up your eyes to starry heavens, behold the planets wheeling in their pre-ordained course. look at the turning of the seasons, the rain and the snow, the sun, the planets, everything works together.\" how could you look at that say that there is no God. Me - each of these is described better by physics and biology. this argument from incredulity is not a solid argument. and we easily recognize this now. Jonathan - ontological. there is a God based on a definition of God. God is defined as perfection. one of the perfections is necessary existence. Me (and Justin) - just saying it doesn't make it so. this point was responded to, by asserting that \"we are simply exploring the concept\" .

Justin Brierley - Christian Moderator Paul Clarke - Christian Duncan Rossiter - Atheist Notes My responses in bold , quotes in italic , and the rest is a paraphrase. I may change this formatting convention as I go through the project in the future. Duncan - \"hard to be an atheist - people are shocked when they hear\" . \"Primarily belief based on indoctrination at an early age rather than at an age when you can make decisions for yourself.\" Paul - \"saying you're a Christian, as opposed to Muslim or Hindu, you get the same sort of reaction.\" Question to Duncan - \"why would we be better off without belief in God?\" Justin - \"Do you feel that you've lost something? Does it make one sad that this is all we have?\" Duncan - As a race, why are we better off? Middle East, Ireland, obvious issues. Asking people to pray when they could be doing something themselves. You can, as an atheist, investigate any other truth claims. Paul - the Christian is allowed to investigate anything. \"atheism is an absolute truth claim just as the faith claims.\" Stalin and Mao connected to their atheism? Me - What is clear is that dogmatic thinking, whether religious or atheistic, leads to suffering. however, religion by its very structure celebrates dogmatism, whereas modern scientific (i.e. skeptical) thinking abhors it wherever it is seen. Paul - \"what hitler did was not in accord of Christian beliefs\" Me - The bible is a multiple-choice text. You can find anything in it, so it can be used to justify the worst behavior and the best behavior. Paul - \"the 20th century was an experiment in secularism, and the result was secular evil more virulent than what came before.\" Paul - people take belief systems and use them for evil. Christianity is not inherently evil. there is evil in the human heart. the problem is with selfish people who might come along and use christianity or any other belief systems for there end. Duncan - human beings will do evil. Paul - why haven't we evolved out of that? Me - even asking this question shows a remarkable ignorance about how evolution works. first, we are effectively the same humans now (from an evolution standpoint) as we were when we left africa. so why would we expect to have \"evolved out of that?\" second, it is clear that a balance of selfish tendencies and societal, non-selfish, tendencies leads to success in social creatures like us. therefore, we are still stuck with those selfish tendencies. I am not convinced that if we were able to eliminate this, that this would necessarily be a good thing overall. it could be that this selfish, competitive, aspect gives us the motivation to find creative solutions to problems about which we might otherwise be complacent. Paul - second hand belief and disbelief, from parents, community, needs to be scrutinized and figured out yourself. Paul - atheism has no objective way of determining right from wrong. Duncan - God supposedly created everything, absolutely everything, knows us, and what we are going to do and yet there are people starving that he could have saved. He must be in control of these things but I have not seen any answers out there from Christianity for \"why the evil, why at all?\" Paul - agrees that God knows these things, and that the evil is allowed to happen for a reason. In man-made evil, is not directly caused by God (because of free will). on natural evil, he asks \"do you think there is enough food in the world to feed everyone in the world?\" Me - absolutely yes. it's just not distributed properly. and that doesn't get God off the hook, because he could easily make the soil more fertile, etc... in the places without enough food currently. Duncan - if people prayed a little less and do a little more, then things would be improved. Paul - you can pray and do, as well. Duncan - prayer is a waste of time. Paul - prayer is the sort of activity that makes yourself more into the type of person that could help. if prayer is a waste of time, do you do anything that wastes time? Certainly you could do more. Paul - is there ever a justification for allowing suffering? yes, like a nurse giving a shot, to allow for a higher goal. so, is there a higher goal, to justify the suffering? if there were one, then it would have to be pretty big and pretty important. the christian answer to it is the higher goal in question is the glory of god. somehow, all of these things work together for the glory of god. Duncan - maybe my brain is not wired right, but I don't see how people dying people for the glory of god, even if they do not believe or ever heard of \"your god\" . Paul - we are seeing the back of the tapestry, not the front. the messy side. Paul - to strictly be an atheist and to make the absolute truth claim that there is nowhere anywhere in the universe a god you need complete knowledge and ethical perfection. Me - what a ridiculous straw man. replace \"God\" in this sentence with \"Fairy\" or \"Unicorn\" or \"Zeus\" and you'll immediately see why. Justin - what about the positive impact, when they found christ. Duncan - what about the positive impact of atheism? Me - is there anything that you believe in, strongly, for which the only evidence you have are stories in ancient texts?","tags":"Unbelievable Project","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Mar/01/unbelievable-project-does-christianity-enslave-are-we-better-off-without-belief-in-god/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Mar/01/unbelievable-project-does-christianity-enslave-are-we-better-off-without-belief-in-god/"},{"title":"Unbelievable Project: A Non-Believer's Armchair Perspective on Six Years of Christian Debates","text":"So I've decided to start a project which will be posted here as I go along.

The conditions of the challenge are simple and reasonable. In each of the four Gospels, begin at Easter morning and read to the end of the book: Matthew 28, Mark 16, Luke 24, and John 20-21. Also read Acts 1:3-12 and Paul's tiny version of the story in I Corinthians 15:3-8. These 165 verses can be read in a few moments. Then, without omitting a single detail from these separate accounts, write a simple, chronological narrative of the events between the resurrection and the ascension: what happened first, second, and so on; who said what, when; and where these things happened. Since the gospels do not always give precise times of day, it is permissible to make educated guesses. The narrative does not have to pretend to present a perfect picture--it only needs to give at least one plausible account of all of the facts. Additional explanation of the narrative may be set apart in parentheses. The important condition to the challenge, however, is that not one single biblical detail be omitted. Andy Bannister has this description , which really is consistent with every detail, and supposed contradiction. What is the problem with this method that Andy uses? It is helpful to consider a similar situation that arrises in mathematics, in the process of regression. Regression In linear regression, I might have, say, a handful of data points: X Y 0.0 -12.5 1.0 17.9 2.0 -3.2 3.0 11.4 4.0 10.8 5.0 28.8 6.0 31.8 7.0 28.3 8.0 23.4 9.0 21.9 10.0 32.7 Which is plotted as When we do a linear regression, we fit to a standard \"y=mx+b\" form. For this data, the best fit is y=3.4 x + 0.27, with a mean squared error of 77.9. Overall, not a bad looking fit. However, if we fit to a 10-th power polynomial, we can get even better! 10 9 8 7 6 5 -0.0007039 x + 0.0363 x - 0.8051 x + 10.04 x - 77.13 x + 376.5 x 4 3 2 - 1159 x + 2152 x - 2163 x + 891.8 x - 12.54 with a Mean Squared Error of Zero!!! In the field of statistics, this is referred to as over-fitting, and is the result of fitting the noise. In other words, it is fitting the meaningless differences from one point to another by adding a tunable parameter for each detail in the data. With each new parameter we get a \"better\" fit, by the criterion of mean squared error, but we lose sight of the meaning. This is the mathematical equivalent of losing sight of the forest for the trees. Back to the Resurrection If we look at Andy Bannister's very clever solution, we notice something quite interesting: for every single difference between the Gospel accounts, he adds a detail not found in the story to explain it. One can pretty much do this for any two accounts that don't say logically contradictory things, and can be seen as an example of over-fitting. I think it highlights two things: ​1) The challenge is probably not a very good one. One can Rube-Goldberg a story together to fit any amount of details ​2) People will go to great lengths harmonizing something that they have a vested interest in believing.","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Feb/15/resurrection-linear-regression-and-the-art-of-harmonization/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2013/Feb/15/resurrection-linear-regression-and-the-art-of-harmonization/"},{"title":"There is no population","text":"So I've been following and intro stats class for a project of mine, and came across this curious definition: A statistic is number that describes a sample A parameter is number that describes a population I got to wondering what a population really is, and couldn't find the dividing line between the sample and the population. If you polled everyone in a state, would that data represent population data or sample data? It becomes clear that the population is a theoretical concept only, made-up to make a sampling distribution make sense. More and more I find the Bayesian perspective demonstrably clearer. Sure, a statistic is a property of a sample of data. A parameter is always, however, a property of the model. There is never a dividing line here, and the limits of inference come down to the limits of the model, and the limits of the data in constraining the parameters of the model.

Although I am not a huge fan of Krauss and Shermer, I thought they did a decent job. As I was watching, I nearly jumped out of my seat with some arm-chair quaterbacking...\"ask this next!!!\". D'Sousa claimed that the Bible predicted the Big Bang (i.e. universe from nothing) thousands of years before science. He also admitted that the day and night before the Sun was not true (around 1 hr and 20 minutes in), was refuted by science, and was really the product of a fundamentalist reading of the bible. The next question out of Krauss' mouth should have been, \"by what criterea do you decide what is true in the Bible?\" What D'Sousa was doing was saying that, where we have learned things from science and one can plausibly read the Bible in the same way, then that is true in the Bible. Otherwise, it is false in the Bible. In this case, the Bible is making no predictions, because it has many claims which cannot be demonstrated to be true except through science. It's like you rattle off a whole series of random digits, like (and I did this by computer): 3, 6, 4, 3, 1, 0, 2, 9, 7, 8, 6, 4, 1, 1, 6, 8, 9, 5, 3, 4, 0, 6, 9, 9, 4, 6, 4, 9, 6, 9, 3, 8, 6, 8, 3, 9, 6, 9, 8, 1, 4, 0, 9, ... and then noting, hey, this starts with a \"3\", and look at some of the other digits (in bold): 3 , 6, 4, 3, 1 , 0, 2, 9, 7, 8, 6, 4 , 1 , 1, 6, 8, 9, 5 , 3, 4, 0, 6, 9 , 9, 4, 6 , 4, 9, 6, 9, 3, 8, 6, 8, 3, 9, 6, 9, 8, 1, 4, 0, 9, ... you see the digits of pi!

In this case they were talking about the technical use of terms versus the colloquial use. We see that in physics a lot, with terms like energy, force, and heat, and one has to be very careful when using these terms. In the podcast, they used the example of people using the word \"logical\", as in \"that is the logical thing to do\". The host thought this should really mean \"that is the reasonable thing to do\", given that they aren't generally doing a deductive proof to make the decision. The tone he used was that this should be obvious...however it is not...it is wrong. Why should the word \"logical\" be restricted to deductive logic? Why should it not include inductive logic? Pretty much that pulls in all of probability theory , and it then becomes (nearly) synonymous with \"reasonable\". When I say the two phrases in my head, I do sense a subtle differerence, with \"logical\" being more definititive than \"reasonable\". Perhaps it is more of a difference like \"probable\" and \"plausible\" - still not a deductive distinction, but a distinction of magnitude in inductive reasoning. Still, it is an interesting thing to think about how we use language in science and society.","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2012/Dec/07/logical-vs-reasonable/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2012/Dec/07/logical-vs-reasonable/"},{"title":"God does Not Exist, Clearly","text":"In a facebook conversation , Matthew Bell claimed that \"the evidence for the existence of God has been made so clear that any who do not believe in it are without excuse before him and are in denial of the evidence.\" He then pointed me to a lecture by William Lane Craig (WLC), where this evidence is laid out. Let's look at this supposedly clear evidence. The Argument WLC starts by looking at 7 things that point to something more than naturalism. I interject a few criticisms, but many more can be found online. My main point is stated at the bottom of this post. ​1. \"Why is there something rather than nothing?\" \"Everything that exists has an explanation, either in the necessity of its own being, or in a cause.\" He claims that this point is plausible, at least more than its contradiction, and then proceeds to give a straightforward, everyday-sort of analogy. I think we have learned in the last 100 years that these analogies are completely useless once you move a little bit away from everyday experience - really big, really small, really fast, really old, etc... He continues with \"Some things exist necessarily (say, numbers) without any cause. All other things have an external cause (say, mountains, planets, etc...).\" He then says that it seems plausible that the explanation of the universe is an external cause. Why? No reason is given. He then goes on to state that that cause must be transcendent and personal. The cause must be greater than the uiniverse, and thus cannot be physical or material. Only two kinds of things are non-physical: an abstract object and an intelligent mind (i.e. an unbodied consciousness). Why only these two? No attempt to expand this list is given. Can you claim that the mind could even exist without material? No support for is given. These are simply asserted. ​2. Origin of the universe. Does the universe have a beginning? Here he uses his standard rant against the actual infinite (transfinite arithmetic), then introduces the Big Bang evidence, and then the Borde, Guth, and Vilenkin theorem. A nice treatment of this can be found here , but there are many others online. An appeal is made to the \"out of nothing, nothing comes\" as very successful in science - again, ignoring the uncaused events in quantum physics, to which Vilinkin himself references in his original paper. He continues with, \"the cause must be c hangeless, timeless, spaceless, and personal\". Again, he says that it is \"plausibly\" personal. \"How else could a timeless cause give rise to a temporal effect like a beginning?\" A theme is happening - at each stage of his argument he is appealing to our ordinary sense of things, our incredulity, and our lack of any curiousity. ​3. Fine tuning argument. His only response to the physical necessity of these constants being what they are is \"the physical necessity of the constants being fine tuned is implausible because 'these constants are independent in the theory'\". This is entirely unconvicing, given that the theory is known to be incomplete! True, right now, the constants are indendent but that is simply because they are not derived in any way from a more fundamental understanding. ​4. Argument from objective moral values and duties. I think Sam Harris' arguments for objective morality , based on science, are more convincing than Craig's here. ​5. Argument from the \"greatest possible conceivable being\". This argument is essentially \"If I can imagine it, it must exist\" (yes, I know that's an oversimplification) He claims that this entire argument, except the first point \"God could possible exist\", is uncontentious. He then says that the atheist must demonstrate that the concept of God is incoherent (like a married bachelor) to demonstrate that God could not possibly exist. He then argues from incredulity (again) - \"what do you think?\" \"It seems to me that an all-good, all powerful being is coherent.\", etc... I can't imagine anyone is ever convinced by such wordplay. ​6. Historical details of Jesus. WLC claims that most historials agree with the following three historical points: a) empty tomb b) postmortem appearances c) transformation of the desciples (i.e they were willing to die for them.) My first response, as I was listening to this was, whoa! We just jumped about 13 billion years! Up to this point we were talking about the origins of matter and the universe, and now we jump to a mere 2000 years ago. I really like the response by Robert M Price here , where he deals quite well with the development of legendary material. ​7. Personal experience of God. WLC admits this isn't evidence. The Point It is not my point to criticize WLC arguments for their content. I've sketched some criticisms here, as they appear to me, but my main contention is that this evidence is not clear evidence for God . Matthew Bell claimed that \"the evidence for the existence of God has been made so clear that any who do not believe in it are without excuse before him and are in denial of the evidence.\", and yet this evidence is not at all clear. It relates either to the edge of our understanding on cosmology, 2000 year old texts written decades after the events by people who do not claim to be eyewitnesses, or \"feel-good\" feelings when you do something nice for someone or pray. In each case the evidence is either at our ignorance or our subjectivity, and not clear. So, what would I want? For example, before Darwin, there was clear evidence for design. Any person could easily see it with their eyes, it was demonstrable in, literally, millions of ways. Watching a beaver build a dam, or a parsitic wasp infect a caterpillar, the match of function and form was truly obvious. Of course, once Darwin demonstrated that this could be explained without a designer, it ceased to be evidence for a designer - but it was clear evidence at the time. So-called faith-healings would also provide clear evidence, if they could be repeated and not easily explained with human psychology and the science of placebo, etc... It would be evidence that anyone could approach and deal with, and would point beyond the natural world (perhaps). However, this evidence seems to retreat under the slightest skeptical scrutiny. How about evidence for something else, perhaps not an everyday phenomenon? What about the Big Bang? Is there clear evidence for it? Yes! Of course, it's a little more work to see it, but I can get middle-school students to be able to do the math, measuring red-shifts, and calculate the age of the universe - from real data! This is clear evidence - the very thing that is lacking when we are talking about the supposed creator of the universe who supposedly still acts in the world.","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2012/Nov/26/god-does-not-exist-clearly/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2012/Nov/26/god-does-not-exist-clearly/"},{"title":"A few things about Carl Sagan","text":"It's Carl Sagan day, so it is worth to pause for a moment to remember his contributions.

His argument: \"But as far as I know, no one before me has ever traveled to this dimension (a) while their cortex was completely shut down, and (b) while their body was under minute medical observation, as mine was for the full seven days of my coma.\" Nowhere, however, does he seem to consider that, perhaps, his hallucination could have happened in the brief interval of the cortex shutting down or the interval of him waking up. Even if he experienced days away in paradise doesn't mean that the actual experience lasted at all during the time that his cortex was confirmed to be inactive. Since this possibility took me a whole 10 seconds to think of (and there could be others) it is clear he is not being critical about, what is most likely, a very moving experience for him. I do not begrudge him this experience, and would love to have one myself (if it didn't involved the significant risk of actually dying in the process), but I would be loathe to make universal metaphysical claims from this experience. A nice response to this, as always, comes from Sam Harris. Here Sam Harris says: Alexander asserts that the cessation of cortical activity was \"clear from the severity and duration of my meningitis, and from the global cortical involvement documented by CT scans and neurological examinations....The problem, however, is that \"CT scans and neurological examinations\" can't determine neuronal inactivity—in the cortex or anywhere else. And Alexander makes no reference to functional data that might have been acquired by fMRI, PET, or EEG—nor does he seem to realize that only this sort of evidence could support his case....whatever structural damage appeared on CT could not have been \"global.\"...Coma is not associated with the complete cessation of cortical activity, in any case. And to my knowledge, almost no one thinks that consciousness is purely a matter of cortical activity.

Presupposing Naturalism?","text":"I've heard in a number of debates, especially on the historicity of the Resurrection (like the very interesting 6-parter between Robert M Price and Don Johnson ), that the reason a skeptic doesn't believe the Resurrection of Jesus is that they have a presupposition against miracles, or the supernatural, and simply discount it on principle. There are two mistakes with this idea, which I find illustrative of ignorance of proper scientific thinking. Most of these biases against miracles are learned from evidence , as most miracle claims come up empty. So it is not an irrational bias, but a rational one, based on life experience. It shouldn't matter anyway - if something is true, then one should be able to convince even a skeptic. And it is perfectly natural to distrust extraordinary claims, and it is the job of the claimant to make the case. I thought of two examples from my life where I was skeptical of an extraordinary claim, one where it turned out my perspective was correct and the other not. In the 1990's, the first evidence for the acclerating universe came out. I remember thinking, \"No way this is true.\" At the time, I thought their calibration of the supernovae used as standard candles was somehow incorrect. Did the researchers approach this skepticism with \"oh, you just are biased against theories that propose unknown external forces, or violations of known laws\"? No. Other groups repeated it, they confirmed any calibration, and came up with a theoretical structure (using the Cosmological Constant) to describe it. Then I was convinced. Was I wrong in my skepticism? Absolutely not. The response to skeptics is to bring the evidence to bear on it. If the evidence is not enough to convince a reasonable skeptic, then we can't be particularly confident in it. Recently, there was some data indicating possibly faster-than-light neutrinos. I had a response to this here , where I was skeptical of the result. Again, it was a group of careful scientists who had done the measurments, and had taken into account everything they could think of. I still didn't believe it. Did the researchers approach this skepticism with \"oh, you just are biased against theories that propose unknown external forces, or violations of known laws\"? No. Others tried to analyze the same data and the set up, and the scientists explored other explanations. Turned out to be a loose cable . Here again, my skepticism was well placed. It's not bias to be skeptical. It isn't irrational to demand a higher-than-average standard for extraordinary claims, no matter what. If you make such a claim, and that higher-than-average standard is not met, then you cannot be confident in that claim. It doesn't matter whether the claim is religious or scientific, the same rules apply.","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2012/Sep/25/naturalistic-bias-presupposing-naturalism/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2012/Sep/25/naturalistic-bias-presupposing-naturalism/"},{"title":"Aliens!","text":"Here is an interesting attempt to make the Drake equation more accessible: http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120821-how-many-alien-worlds-exist I like the fact that they have the various standard assumptions, from optimistic to skeptical.

Of course, near the end of the calculation it gets a little dicey, but so are all such problems.","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2012/Sep/07/aliens/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2012/Sep/07/aliens/"},{"title":"Statistics vs Probability","text":"It's been a while since my last post, and I hope to get back into regularly posting, now that the semester is starting. I'm also testing out new posting tools. So, as a beginning, I start with an extract from an introductory statistics class: I had a strong feeling that this was a job for probability, not for statistics, so I thought, how would one do this problem: We observe h1=4, N1=10 What is the probability of h2, N2=100? It seems that the \"probability\" approach would be more fruitful, so I threw together this little calculation, where I simply marginalize over the single \"random coin\" parameter, given data 1 (our initial data) and look at the probability of various h2's: since which also arises in the normalization condition for the beta distribution. This leads to our final solution: which leads to the following plot, for h1=4, N1=10, and N2=100: I can't help but think there is a simplification of the equation, but I don't see anything obvious that cancels. Certainly, for large N's I could approximate it.

If you're impatient, here is one of the arguments: Do you believe that Absolute Truth exists? Possible answers… ​1. yes -> you go on to the next piece 2. no -> is it absolutely true that absolute truth doesn't exist? 1. yes -> then you actually believe that absolute truth exists! 2. no -> you get asked again if you believe that Absolute Truth exists (with the statement \"This is not a glitch (Think about it)\". - essentially implying either that you're making an absolute truth statement, or you can't state anything. A similar point is made about the laws of logic: \"If you believe that laws of logic do not exist, how do you make decisions about the most basic things in life? How do you decide which side of the road to drive on? How do you choose whether to drink water or poison for nourishment? One interesting aspect of denying laws of logic, like the law of non-contradiction, is that since you DO NOT believe in laws of logic, you actually DO believe in laws of logic. If contradictions are allowed in your worldview then so is that one.\" This form of presuppositionalist argument pretty much says that without God there can not be laws of logic, and thus to even have a worldview presupposes the existence of God. Why this is stupid One thing that comes to mind in this type of argument is that there is a serious fallacy of the excluded middle. Do you believe that absolute truth exists? How about \"I don't know\" or \"you haven't defined absolute or truth, so the question doesn't make sense\". I'm not convinced that they can be defined in such a way that I'd be confident in them. What we have at bottom are sensory experiences , and what model of the universe is most consistent with that sensory experience. I have little patience for purely philosophical arguments that aren't tied to what we know from science. Another thing that comes to mind is that this argument, at best, gets you to a deism. The only part that even attempts to get to a Christian god is the moral argument, and that has its own problems. Just a few thoughts on this, mostly silly, line of arguments.

Confidence in a claim should scale with the evidence for that claim Ockham's razor - simpler theories are preferred (i.e. you pay a marginalization penalty for each parameter, across its prior) Simpler means fewer adjustable parameters Simpler means that the predictions are both specific and not overly plastic . For example, a hypothesis which is consistent with the observed data, and also be consistent if the data were the opposite as well would be overly plastic. Arguing for the God hypothesis, saying that a universe fine tuned for life is evidence for design is a hypothesis which is overly plastic. If our universe were not fine tuned for life, and life is exceptional, then that too would be evidence for design - thus the data, and its opposite, are covered by the hypothesis. Your inference is only as good as the hypotheses that you consider. If you consider only randomness and psychic, then nearly every octopus will be psychic. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. It is better to explicitly display your assumptions rather than implicitly hold them.

You get a group of devout people supporting it who claim that the scientific establishment is unfair, is shunning their research, is not allowing them to present at conferences, is suppressing their ideas and they want a level playing field. I've seen the same whining and crying from people supporting Intelligent Design and people supporting UFOs and people supporting psychics. It is true, that the scientific establishment will not publish papers for these people, given the (lack of) evidence they show. It is biased against ideas with little supporting evidence. It is, however, not unfairly biased, and least not typically. Scientists are humans, and so you do get the occasional overzealous skepticism. That's actually not a bad thing. As Carl Sagan said, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. It is incumbent on these people to support their claims with the proper amount of evidence. If, for example, it was absolutely clear that cold fusion worked then it would be trivial to convert even the most hardened skeptic. If one had convincing evidence for psychic phenomena or ufos or intelligent design, it would become mainstream science and be very easy to convince people. The problem is that these topics are on the fringe, their claims extraordinary, are physical implausible, and the evidence for their existence is terrible. When you hear about ideas suppressed by the scientific you should immediately think \"unlikely, unsupported claim\", despite what the claimants are saying. If the evidence is strong enough, it will convince the skeptics. Both quantum mechanics and relativity are totally weird, and those went from nothing to the dominant idea within a decade because of the strength of the evidence.","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2012/May/14/suppression-of-ideas-in-science/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2012/May/14/suppression-of-ideas-in-science/"},{"title":"Free Will and Entropy","text":"In Sam Harris' talk on free will , we have the following comment: \"if we caught a serial killer, we'd assume his responsibility because of his ability to have chosen otherwise. if we then discovered that he had a brain tumor which we could determine resulted in homicidal behavior, we'd determine that he was not responsible - that he was a victim of biology. this, however, is just a special case of any biological brain state - if we could know for certain how brain states generated behavior, we would just as certainly determine that he was not responsible for his actions and is just a victim of biology\" We have two parts of knowledge needed here: know for certain the current state and how (in detail) that state progresses to the macroscopic outcomes. From this we have a sort of determinism that is inconsistent with a simple notion of \"free will\". Now, I happened to be teaching the concept of entropy in my physics class at the same time I watched this, and I was struck by the parallel. I had thought of this before, last year, but never wrote about it. The concept of entropy arises when we don't know the details of every single molecule in a system, knowing only some gross average features like the average energy or pressure. If we knew the current state of the system perfectly, and knew the laws of physics to forecast from that state, then we'd be able to reverse any process. However, given our lack of knowledge, the system moves in the single direction of increasing entropy, where the the energy is spread out the most, and the system has access to the most number of micro states consistent with the macro states we actually measure. The system is described in a non-deterministic way, even if all of the laws of physics underlying the motion of the molecules is entirely deterministic. Perhaps our feeling of \"free will\" is real, in the same sense that entropy is real - it's a non-deterministic description despite the underlying deterministic processes, arising from our practical lack of knowledge of the perfect details of those underlying processes. This idea needs more fleshing out, but it seems to be an interesting perspective to me.","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2012/May/07/free-will-and-entropy/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2012/May/07/free-will-and-entropy/"},{"title":"On Being Wrong","text":"I tell my students that I supremely hope that they have the experience of one of their cherished ideas shown to be wrong. I was recently confronted with a perception mistake on my part which I found to be pretty interesting, even if the consequences are pretty mundane. So, I'm learning how to swim, and I take lessons at the local YMCA. I have recently started practicing a little at the university pool. When I first started swimming at the university pool I noticed that it was significantly longer than the one at the YMCA…at least that is what I thought. I had told a number of people this, particularly how much longer it looked and how much longer it felt swimming to the other side. I was told this past weekend that they are the same length, which I totally didn't believe. The swim instructor insisted that they are both 25 yards long, and that she has swim meets in both pools. Still skeptical, I did some digging. The university pool seemed, to me, to be 1.5 to 2 times longer! No way I could make a mistake of that magnitude! It felt much longer! It took longer to swim across! *sigh* They are the same length. What I find very interesting is how certain I was of a completely physical measurement, that later turned out to be incorrect. There is something about how the pool had very few people at the university or had glass on each end, compared to the crowded YMCA pool which is walled in by cinderblock, combined with my inexperience with swimming which probably gives rise to the illusion. Or perhaps the fact that the YMCA pool is narrower adds to the illusion. Whatever it is, it was a completely obvious, visceral estimate of the length of an object that turned out to be completely wrong. It reminds me of the sort of arguments that people make like \"Air Force pilots will not make mistakes in observing things in the sky, which bolsters the UFO claim\" or \"Doctors will not make mistakes in observing medical effects, which bolsters this miracle claim.\" Arguments from authority fail because authorities can be mistaken, even on basic things.","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2012/Mar/20/on-being-wrong/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2012/Mar/20/on-being-wrong/"},{"title":"Evolution and Rationality","text":"Stephen Law vs Alvin Plantinga on the Unbelievable podcast on the topic of the \"The Evolutionary Argument Against Naturalism\". Basic argument, from Wikipedia on Evolutionary argument against naturalism I haven't read the responses, so that my response will be fresh and untainted. Plantinga defined: N as naturalism, which he defined as \"the idea that there is no such person as God or anything like God; we might think of it as high-octane atheism or perhaps atheism-plus.\"[12] E as the belief that human beings have evolved in conformity with current evolutionary theory R as the proposition that our faculties are \"reliable\", where, roughly, a cognitive faculty is \"reliable\" if the great bulk of its deliverances are true. He specifically cited the example of a thermometer stuck at 72 °F (22 °C) degrees placed in an environment which happened to be at 72 °F as an example of something that is not \"reliable\" in this sense[9] and suggested that the conditional probability of R given N and E, or P(R|N&E), is low or inscrutable.[19] Plantinga's argument began with the observation that our beliefs can only have evolutionary consequences if they affect behaviour. To put this another way, natural selection does not directly select for true beliefs, but rather for advantageous behaviours. Plantinga distinguished the various theories of mind-body interaction into four jointly exhaustive categories: epiphenomenalism, where behaviour is not caused by beliefs. \"if this way of thinking is right, beliefs would be invisible to evolution\" so P(R/N&E) would be low or inscrutable[20] Semantic epiphenomenalism, where beliefs have a causative link to behaviour but not by virtue of their semantic content. Under this theory, a belief would be some form of long-term neuronal event.[21] However, on this view P(R|N&E) would be low because the semantic content of beliefs would be invisible to natural selection, and it is semantic content that determines truth-value. Beliefs are causally efficacious with respect to behaviour, but maladaptive, in which case P(R|N&E) would be low, as R would be selected against. Beliefs are causally efficacious with respect to behaviour and also adaptive, but they may still be false. Since behaviour is caused by both belief and desire, and desire can lead to false belief, natural selection would have no reason for selecting true but non-adaptive beliefs over false but adaptive beliefs. Thus P(R|N&E) in this case would also be low.[22] Plantinga pointed out that innumerable belief-desire pairs could account for a given behaviour; for example, that of a prehistoric hominid fleeing a tiger: Perhaps Paul very much likes the idea of being eaten, but when he sees a tiger, always runs off looking for a better prospect, because he thinks it unlikely the tiger he sees will eat him. This will get his body parts in the right place so far as survival is concerned, without involving much by way of true belief. ... Or perhaps he thinks the tiger is a large, friendly, cuddly pussycat and wants to pet it; but he also believes that the best way to pet it is to run away from it. ... Clearly there are any number of belief-cum-desire systems that equally fit a given bit of behaviour. Thus, Plantinga argued, the probability that our minds are reliable under a conjunction of philosophical naturalism and naturalistic evolution is low or inscrutable. Therefore, to assert that naturalistic evolution is true also asserts that one has a low or unknown probability of being right. This, Plantinga argued, epistemically defeats the belief that naturalistic evolution is true and that ascribing truth to naturalism and evolution is internally dubious or inconsistent.[24] There are certainly several things in this argument that need to be thought out. Point (1) is certainly true: any beliefs that do not affect behavior in any way would be invisible to evolution. I doubt there are many beliefs in this category. Even something vague, like the belief in a deist god, would at some point affect behavior in some way. Point (3) is also uncontroversial. Point (2) I'm not sure I understand entirely, so I'll focus on point (4). There are two parts - \"behaviour is caused by both belief and desire,\" and \"innumerable belief-desire pairs could account for a given behaviour\" with the example of running from tigers because of various false beliefs. The final piece of this, however, is the limited resources of the brain. Our brain takes many computational short-cuts, because of efficiency and limited resources. If you have a number of different belief/desire pairs that lead to behavior, the brain will settle on those belief/desire pairs that generalize to the largest number of things. This will certainly be in cases where the result is closer to reality than not. We run away not only from tigers, but also bears, snakes, and spiders. The desire to pet or the mistaken belief that running away is the best way to get towards an animal would not generalize quite so well to these other creatures. Plantinga uses this argument from rationality to bolster his theism - if rationality is unlikely given naturalism and evolution, then theism is more likely. However, he fails to notice that rationality isn't truly the norm. Yes, we can make some astounding feats of rationality as a collection, but it takes serious work to overcome the natural biases, and failures of reasoning inherent in the human condition. The cognitive short-cuts leads us to make many errors of observation, deduction, and induction. He also fails to point out the many beliefs that people have that are irrational but have a benefit, or the beliefs that people have which are irrational and have no effect and thus can get carried along without being selected against. In fact, the situation is very much like what you'd expect from evolution - some wrong beliefs with adaptive benefits, some wrong beliefs with no penalty, some correct beliefs by accident, etc… Finally, even if our beliefs were 90% wrong, we'd still be able to trust rationality as a collection - which is exactly what science does. It forces fallible people to not believe things until it can be replicated, it downplays anecdotal evidence, arguments from authority, and recognizes the cognitive failures of humans in order to overcome them.","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2012/Mar/06/evolution-and-rationality/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2012/Mar/06/evolution-and-rationality/"},{"title":"What is good in religion","text":"I was asked recently if I thought there was anything good about religion. I felt it was an important enough question to give it a fair amount of thought. Coincidentally, I listened to a podcast that dealt with some of these issues. The podcast is called Unbelievable , and the particular episode is called Should atheists be more religious? Alain de Botton and James Orr . I like this podcast in general, because they pit the religious against the non-religious in an informal discussion for about an hour and a half. This particular episode raised the issue of religions' usefulness, and what can be borrowed by atheists. One of the points was the contrast between the Christian view of humanity and the view of humanity as is often suggested by secularists. In the Christian view, humans are essentially fallen creatures, are naturally evil and need the grace of God to save them from this. The main secular view, which seemingly has been espoused since around the 1960s, asserts that people are naturally good and that culture is the dominant force which turns them bad, and further that through rational analysis one can overcome this cultural influence as science transcends all cultural barriers. This just doesn't gel with basic observations, I feel, and thus there is a benefit to the Christian view as a metaphor. If you've ever been to a daycare, it is quite obvious that children are naturally bad, or at least have more bad than good, and need to be saved from this. Now, we don't need to believe in a magic garden and a talking snake, or assert that this observation of humanity has as a consequence that the Earth is 6000 years old, in order to draw value from it. In the same way that we draw value from Shakespeare, we can draw some value from the Genesis story (although I think there have to be better stories, which place women in a more favorable light!). Honestly, I think one can make a reasonable argument from evolution that reflects the ``fallen being'' idea. Essentially, we have a balance between selfish desires (clearly advantageous) and social desires (also advantageous, in social animals). A proper balance needs to be made, and there is a spectrum of selfish impulses, and the desire to suppress them in various ways. I think some of the rituals of religion help to remind us of this. Even gathering as a group on Sundays is an example of this - one is more likely to reflect on helping others when one is regularly together in a group. It is true that there are things of benefit which, in the past, have only been the purview of religions. Getting together regularly, meditative rituals, ritual individual sacrifice (not human or animal sacrifice! think Lent here...), and traditions of giving (think Christmas) are examples of this sort of thing. Notice, however, that none of these requires the inclusion of superstitious claims, or claims about the cosmos or our role in it. In addition to the benefits, there are a number of costs associated with these same examples that get dragged along with the religion. The blind following of authorities, the dogmatic adherence to invisible ``realities'', and the divisive nature of the practices are a few of these. I believe that there are ways of getting the benefits with minimizing the costs. I also believe that the truth of claims is intricately related to their usefulness . What I mean is if you have a system of belief that does not reflect reality, then reality has a habit of making itself known, even if it might take a while. Finally, I think there is a lot to learn about what is beneficial to human mental well-being and societal well-being, and that some of these benefits currently are most clearly demonstrated in a religious context. I don't think that they need to be exclusively achieved in a religious context.","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2012/Mar/05/what-is-good-in-religion/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2012/Mar/05/what-is-good-in-religion/"},{"title":"Best quote in a while about global warming...","text":"In the article Sixteen Concerned Scientists: No Need to Panic About Global Warming , physicist Ivar Giaever is quotes the American Physical Society policy on global warming: 'The evidence is incontrovertible: Global warming is occurring.

It has a fascinating history, described in detail in \"The theory that would not die\" by McGrayne - a truly wonderful read. A nice summary can be found here . The funny thing is that, upon looking into Bayesian analysis, it all seemed so obvious to me...not trivial, but obvious. It's just a mathematical way of writing: Initial Belief + New Data -> Improved Belief It is a straightforward application of probability theory, has many intuitive examples, and the only competition (so-called orthodox or frequentist stats) can be shown to have serious, obvious flaws. Although in some fields Bayesian analysis is the standard, introductory classes in statistics are still dominated by the frequentist culture. This is an example of a practical working solution being upstaged by something else, something inferior. I often wonder, why isn't everyone a Bayesian? So, then we come to hiccups. One thing about hiccups is that it is likely to be a behavior inherited by our fish ancestors ! How cool is that? Anyway, you ask 10 people and they will give you 10 different solutions to getting rid of hiccups. Usually this involves imbibing a large quantity of liquid, or doing something either annoying or uncomfortable. When I was young, my mother taught be that if you drink a small amount (no more than 2 swallows) of a carbonated beverage it gets rid of the hiccups...instantly. It has worked every time I've tried, but I don't have carbonated beverages at home much, and when I do I don't want to waste a whole can for 2 or 3 swallows. Then, one of our children's preschool teachers taught me this one, which has worked every time, and in every person I've told it to. I have yet to see a counter example. It's bizarrely simple, and I wonder how it works. Here are the steps: take a sip of water say, out loud, the word \"one\" take another sip say, out loud, the word \"two\" ... By the time you're at 9, they're gone. You may not even need to get up to nine, but still, 9 small sips of water is not bad. This is a practical solution, which seems to have no counter example, and is superior to every other solution I've found...just like Bayesian analysis! Well, perhaps the link is a little weak, but it's worth considering.

First, I have to say I am not entirely convinced it is a good idea. I'd be open to evidence (not just opinion!) of the harm, but I haven't actually seen any. Further, there seems to be a need for fantasy play with children below a certain age (somewhere around 10). I am not sure of the developmental role, but the behavior (even without adult help) is ubiquitous. Finally, it is fun and interesting. Here's a little sample story that happened this year, that made me understand that I have no idea how kids are actually perceiving the world. We had gotten an Elf-on-the-Shelf this year for the first time. Our kids had seen them before, at school and at friends houses, so they were familiar with the rules: no touching the elf (or he loses his powers); the elf can't touch the ground at all; you can talk to him all you want (but he won't talk back to you); he goes off each night, and returns in a new place in the house where you need to find him. Now, one morning we hadn't secured our little elf too well...he was sitting on a stuffed Santa, hanging on a door. At one point the kids started shouting because the Elf was leaning way over about to fall. After a little bit of concern, all the kids had something in another room to do, and I managed to adjust him back up, secure him, and go into another room myself. When they returned, they were all abuzz with how he had leaned down all by himself, and gotten up all by himself, etc... I suggested perhaps the Santa had helped him up. Very seriously, they looked at me and said \"Dad, that's just a stuffed Santa\". Now I realize that people see agency in non-living things, but it was amazing to see the same done on such a selective basis.

His response to my criticism of his original posts [here][] and [here][1] shows that he missed the point of my criticism. I'll grant him that I may have come off as \"condescending\", and that my \"stick to law\" comment could be interpreted as more than the strategically exaggerated tone used in a blog. So what about his original post and his reply do I find problematic? In his reply Mr Cicchini directs me to address the specific issues with the authors, and in his original post he says that he's \"only begun exploring the relevant issues\", and that he's \"delving into matters that are way over [his] head\". Then, he makes claims like: we create the concept of dark matter \"to allow us to cling to Einstein's theory of general relativity\" \"physicists seem to try and substantiate, rather than question, his [Einstein's] work.\" physicists should \"abandon Einstein's quest of unifying the quantum with the cosmic\" The problem is at least twofold: Although Mr Cicchini claims to be in over his head, he writes as if he is an authority, or that he understands the authorities when in reality he doesn't He is making many claims about motive with no evidence whatsoever The Motives These are both mixed up with a profound lack of understanding of the methods of science. Let's put it this way: Is it true that physicists will first look for ways in which the anomalous mass measurements of galaxies and the current best theory of gravity, Einstein's general theory of relativity (GR), can be made to be consistent even if it means proposing a never-before-observed quantity \"dark matter\"? Yes! Does this imply that they are are unwilling to question GR, in deference to Einstein or for some other reason? No! If you had a theory that has yet to have an exception, in over 100 years, and has made predictions accurate to many many decimal points, and has been shown to predict other unforeseen objects (such as black holes), then it is entirely rational to proceed as the cosmologists have. It is not dogmatic to assert your confidence in something that has a dedicated track record. It is also never the case in science that we \"start from scratch\" when we have an anomalous observation...we only abandon a theory when we have something better in its place...and we don't in this case. In addition, the \"dark matter\" problem is not just a problem for 100-year-old-Einstein's theory but for 300-year-old-Newton's theory! So, if your advice is for scientists to \"start from scratch\", then you're essentially suggesting that we ignore almost everything we've learned in physics for the past 300 years. I have a big problem with that. The Science So, the motive is wrong, but is the science correct? I'd say, \"no\" to that as well. In the second post, there is a reference to the latest faster than light measurements. Mr Cicchini directs me to writer [Brian Vastag][] concerning the experiment. In that article, there is this: > The physicist, Dario Auterio, made no sweeping claims. > > He did not try to explain what the results might mean for the laws of > physics, let alone the broader world. > > After an hour of technical talk, he simply said, \"Therefore, we > present to you today this discrepancy, this anomaly.\" Notice how the *physicists in this experiment* are not making the claims that Mr Cicchini is making, and they show a humility that is the hallmark of true science. Sure, scientists will put down clearly wrong ideas with a harshness that is not common in regular speech. But when they are dealing with events beyond their understanding the humility exhibited by scientists is far greater than in any other human endeavor. Even Christopher Hitchens, who was not known for his humility, would [demonstrate it][] whenever he dealt with science topics on the outskirts of his understanding. On the authorities Mr Cicchini chooses to represent his case, we have the following problems: - Brian Vastag is a science writer, and makes the correct claim that, *if true*, the faster-than-light measurements *could possibly* overturn relativity. It could also be that *if true*, the measurements would cause only a small modification of relativity, as I outlined in the [previous post][dark matter and the speed of light]. It could also be the case that the experiments, or the analysis, are wrong in some way. That's where my money is. Is that dogmatic? No! It is based on the many preliminary violations of relativity over the last century that were shown to be erroneous either in measurement or in analysis. Could I be wrong? Of course! And that would be pretty cool. But I'm not going to be convinced until the dust settles for a while. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. - Lee Smolin, who wrote a book [The Trouble With Physics: The Rise of String Theory, The Fall of a Science, and What Comes Next][]. I have not read this book, but his claims about string theory (from the quotes) don't seem too bad...he essentially is pointing out that string theory is currently lacking any predictions which differ from quantum chromodynamics and general relativity. Mr Cicchini quotes Smolin \"The dark matter hypothesis is preferred mostly because the only other possibility - that we are wrong about Newton's laws, and by extension general relativity - is too scary to contemplate.\" I would guess that this is exaggerated language, referring to the fact that any theory to replace Newton's laws and Einstein's theory would be formidable indeed! It does not, however, immediately imply a dogmatic \"clinging\" to Einstein's theory, although I'll admit I need to read the book to tell for sure. - Peter Lynds is the third reference from Mr Cicchini. After noting the reference, I read Lynds' paper, [\"Time and Classical and Quantum Mechanics: Indeterminacy vs. Discontinuity\"][]. First of all, I wasn't impressed. It certainly lacks the clarity of [Einstein's 1905 paper][], to which it has been compared. It also makes no predictions, as far as I can tell, and certainly hasn't moved more than a small minority of physicists to even consider it. Is this because of a dogmatic loyalty to Einstein? Not at all. It is due to the usual, and rational, mode of scientific discourse in which new ideas purporting to replace established theories need to demonstrate that they are in fact superior to those theories with actual verifiable predictions before they are considered seriously. Further, Mr Cicchini's advice to \"abandon Einstein's quest of unifying the quantum with the cosmic\" is ill-informed. He continues that \"there is no reason to believe that things on a tiny, subatomic scale would obey the same laws as things on a grand, universal scale.\" Let's put it this way: we have two amazing approximate theories: quantum chromodynamics and general relativity. Each working in their own domains (the really small and the really big, respectively). They look *nothing* like each other. One is probabilistic and discrete while the other is deterministic and continuous. In some limiting cases, it can be shown that medium-sized events (i.e. events on the scale of humans up to planets) can be seen as limiting case of quantum events. In addition, relativity can be shown to work for gravitational effects on medium-sized objects (i.e. the size of planets). What we don't have is a good, unified, set of ideas that link the two domains well. Historically, there is a strong precedent for expecting there to be unifying set of laws. The development of thermodynamics and the connection to atomic theory is one example, the development of electrodynamics and its connection to the microscopic effects of currents and magnets is another. So there is *every reason* to expect that there is a unifying principle. To say \"give up, you'll never find it\" is reminiscent of people saying the same thing for the search for extraterrestrial life, given that we've never found any. ### Silencing the Layperson Finally, I want to address the charge that I am trying to silence laypeople who speak about science, and that this is bad for science. Mr Cicchini writes: > And shutting laypeople out of science, or urging them \"not to speak > about physics\"-which, conveniently, precludes any external > challenges-causes science to take on an even greater dogmatic quality, > which science cannot afford. > For me, this has nothing to do with \"laypeople\" (a phrase I associate more with non-clergy as opposed to non-academic), but with people speaking confidently when their confidence is completely unwarranted. I don't believe you need a PhD to speak about science in a productive way, but you do have to do your homework. The motive claims described above demonstrate a clear ignorance of the true motivations of scientists. If I were trying to confidently tell lawyers what to do or to impugn their motives, I'd be out of line because I know very little about law...and someone would be absolutely correct to call me out on that. Scientists face this all the time, and thus their tone is almost always very conservative, especially when speaking with other scientists. Just look at the language of the scientists doing the faster-than-light experiments. This doesn't mean that scientists are above this kind of misplaced confidence...I could still list many examples of scientists speaking out of their area of expertise, but it is considered a real liability in science. So, the bottom line is that where Mr Cicchini sees a conspiracy, the facts support a rational scientific discourse. Where Mr Cicchini sees an elite academic silencing the criticism by a layperson, the reality is that it is rational to critique *anyone* speaking confidently of things they cannot be confident of. Where Mr Cicchini sees a dogmatic, unswerving, scientific establishment, the facts support the confidence scientists have in centuries old models of the universe that have withstood the hammer blows of criticism during those centuries, all without buckling. It doesn't mean that the new ideas are necessarily *wrong*, but it does mean that we are a lot less confident of them *for good reason*.

It is interesting for the number of science errors, and also the failure of any kind of critical scientific thinking. I will leave it as an exercise for the reader to determine the worst occurrences of these, but I do want to point out two main issues that I see. Metaphorical or Literal? We start with this claim from the page: > Today we take the shape of the earth for granted, but remember that > primitive man had no way to actually know that the earth is spherical. > In fact, without access to exploration and distant observation, the > world most certainly seemed flat, and that is exactly how primitive > men and cultures described it.

That's what > critics would have you believe. But this is simply a cultural > expression (and one that we still use today), and it has little to say > about the truth of the shape of the earth. A similar argument holds for the \"days\" used in Genesis not being literal, 24-hour, days but rather epochs spanning billions of years. The bottom line is: **If it contradicts science, then it is metaphor. If it is consistent with science, then it is prescient.** Or, in other words, **Heads I win. Tails you lose.** Prediction versus Postdiction ----------------------------- The other example I want to look at is one that I hadn't heard before (I've omitted a fair amount of explanatory text, to try to distill it down to the essentials...go read the original if you feel I've done a disservice to the points): > If you've ever read the story of Job in the Bible, [...] he eventually > accused the Lord of being unjust.

One of the ways that you can figure out the issues with claims like this is to play the hypothetical game of \"what if the opposite occurred?\". What would happen to the prescient nature of the quotation? So, say that Pleiades is flying apart, the belt of Orion is fixed, and Arcturus is a star with a more traditional path. What would the quotation mean? All you have to do is reinterpret the *tone* of God's statement, for example God to Job: \"Pleiades is flying apart, could you, Job, bring it together?\" All of the rest of the argument then holds together. Bottom line: **If your statement is consistent with one result, *and its opposite*, then it is meaningless.** But it's worse than that... ### What if it is both? Well, you might claim that the critical thing in the statement which makes it more believable is that God is claiming one effect for Pleiades and the opposite effect for Orion (and a pretty neutral effect for Arcturus). Even if this were flipped, it would still have that contrast. Now, what happens if, for some reason, one could argue that Pleiades was both bound and flying apart, or that the bands of Orion are both loosening and tightening? Pretty much, any statement about them could be made to seem \"prescient\". That's the nature of a post-diction. It is also the reason why pre-dictions are so hard, and why activities like science that make good pre-dictions regularly have the authoritative status that everyone else craves. Pleiades is a young star cluster so, it is a bound system. However, over the course of a couple of orbits around the galaxy, the galactic tidal forces will pull the cluster apart. The Sun was born in such a cluster (as all stars are), and her siblings are far flung by now. So it is easy to see that the Pleiades is currently bound, but not permanently bound. The stars in Orion are moving in various directions. By their own admission, these authors point out that two of the stars are moving closer to each other (in the sky, not in reality) and the other moving away. Thus, part of the belt is tightening. Bottom line: **If your statement is consistent with *any* result, then it is content-free.** or in other words, **Shoot first, and call whatever you hit the target.** Entropy ------- Sorry, I couldn't help but include this example. These Bible quotes are supposedly prescient of the development of the Second Law of Thermodynamics: > *Psalm 102:22-26* In the beginning you laid the foundations of the > earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands. They will perish, > but you remain; they will all wear out like a garment. Like clothing > you will change them and they will be discarded > > *Hebrews 1:10-11* In the beginning, O Lord, you laid the foundations > of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands. They will > perish, but you remain; they will all wear out like a garment. > Enough said.

If you closed to these concepts from the beginning, then no amount of evidence will sway you. I was thinking about this, and what my perspective is, and I came up with a few thoughts. My first reaction is that I don't know what the terms mean. For example, someone says that I am closed to the idea of a \"trogglet\". What does it mean? I am not closed, nor open, to the idea of a \"trogglet\" simply because it is not defined. Ok, so define it! Definition of a transcendent being: Transcendence refers to the aspect of God's nature which is wholly independent of (and removed from) the physical universe. [ wikipedia ] definition of supernatural: The supernatural is that which is not subject to the laws of nature, or more figuratively, that which is said to exist above and beyond nature. [ wikipedia ] definition of miracle A miracle often denotes an event attributed to divine intervention. Alternatively, it may be an event attributed to a miracle worker, saint, or religious leader. A miracle is sometimes thought of as a perceptible interruption of the laws of nature. Others suggest that a god may work with the laws of nature to perform what people perceive as miracles. 1 Theologians say that, with divine providence, God regularly works through created nature yet is free to work without, above, or against it as well. 2 [[wikipedia][2]] I would content that these definitions aren't particularly specific, but let's raise another issue: how would you know that something supernatural exists, or a supernatural event has happened? Since we can only be aware of physical effects, we have three choices: supernatural events occur only supernaturally (i.e. no impact on physical reality) supernatural events have some impact on physical reality and the impact works within physical law supernatural events have some impact on physical reality and the impact goes beyond physical law If you want to claim choice 1, then there is no difference between a supernatural event and no event at all (i.e. it is content-free). If you want to claim choice 2, then there is no way (even in principle!) to tell whether the cause is supernatural, and thus is also content-free. That leaves the final choices, which perhaps is testable (in theory) but you then must rule out any and all possible natural interpretations of those events . Essentially it boils down to a God-of-the-Gaps arguments, because you're simply left with \"I can't think of any way that this event could have happened naturally\". The interesting thing about this is not that we have come to the conclusion that the existence of supernatural events is either content-free or God-of-the-Gaps, but that the purported \"Gaps\" that are often claimed are so trivial, and already filled, that it undermines the entire endeavor. Design in biology is solved by evolution, regardless of the protestations of the creationists. The origin of the universe is systematically being solved by the cosmologists, with no help from the theists. I'd love to see something that really rises to the level of a miracle, like the 10 commandments etched in Pluto or something. Although technically a God-of-the-Gaps argument, it would be very interesting indeed! However, we are given no such evidence. It is reminiscent of the UFO enthusiasts. We'd love to see actual objects from aliens, or actual communication from aliens, or convincing video. Instead, we're given bad evidence after bad evidence.","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2011/Dec/20/closed-to-the-supernatural/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2011/Dec/20/closed-to-the-supernatural/"},{"title":"Presuppositionalism vs evidentialism","text":"These two terms that I had never heard before came up when listening to some Christian apologetic podcasts (specifically Please Convince Me and Stand to Reason ). There seems to be some split between Christian apologists on these two approaches to apology. What is interesting is that the normal course of science uses both, so there really shouldn't be any split for any rational approach to justification of the ideas. Evidentialists argue for the exists of the Christian God through outlining of the evidence of the Christian God, and then follow the logical arguments that come from that. Presuppositionalists seem to assume the existence of the Christian God, but then try demonstrate that the world only makes sense if you do so. In other words, they are \"X is true and here is the evidence or logical argument for X\" and \"if we assume X, then W, Y, and Z that we observe make sense...otherwise W, Y, and Z do not make sense\". Both of these are done in science all the time. Take, Newton's law of gravitation for example. When he proposed the form of the gravitational force, \\( F \\sim 1/r&#94;2\\) , Newton did not provide direct evidence for this form...that was first done only 100 years later by Cavendish . What he did is say was \" if the form of the force is \\( F \\sim 1/r&#94;2\\) , then many other things make sense (i.e. motion of the planets, the tides, the falling of objects near the surface of the Earth, etc...)\". In a way, this is a presuppositionalist argument: if we take X to be true, then our observations of W, Y, and Z make sense. This type of argument is considered evidence in science, and is done all the time. Really, the two ways that scientific theories can be justified are: directly test the assumptions of the theory spin out the consequences, and compare with observation The former is, what the apologists would call, evidentialist while the latter is presuppositionalist. In a fit of irony, I have heard many so-called refutations of atheists on the topic of morality of the form \"atheists claim there is no objective morality, so they can't even state that the actions of the God in the Old Testament are evil\". However, all these atheists are doing are using a preuppositionalist argument: \"If we assume that God is good, and that the 'good' is defined by the statements of Jesus and the ten commandments, then we can demonstrate that the other acts of God in the Bible are evil.\" Personally, I just like to lump both terms into \"rational argument\" and leave it at that. They do little to shed light on the issues, and to me they are a distinction without a difference.","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2011/Dec/19/presuppositionalism-vs-evidentialism/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2011/Dec/19/presuppositionalism-vs-evidentialism/"},{"title":"More fine tuning...NOT","text":"One of the so-called fine-tuned parameters in our solar system (fine-tuned specifically for the development of complex life) is that we have a planet with a large moon (compared to the planet). In his long list of supposed fine tunings, Hugh Ross mentions that we even need a big moon to have life on this planet. Much of the fine tuning argument is a thinly veiled God-of-the-Gaps argument: we can't explain it, therefore God must have done it. One of the things that happens to such arguments is that people finally explain it. So, in that vein, we have the following idea that we may not need such a large moon after all . According to Darren Williams of Pennsylvania State University, \"Large moons are not required for a stable tilt and climate. In some circumstances, large moons can even be detrimental, depending on the arrangement of planets in a given system. Every system is going to be different.\" This is one example of lack of imagination leading to erroneous arguments.

He pointed out that these were not simply gaps, that could possibly be explained in the future, but were logically impossible for science to explain . Here they are: Science can't explain ultimate origins \"If the laws that control the universe started with the universe, then they could not have caused the universe. If not, then the laws would have to have been \"written\" before the universe. Science cannot explain how those laws exist, prior to the universe.\" Science can't justify itself \"Science must be silent on why natural laws take the form that they do. For example, why is the gravitational law of the form \\(F \\sim 1/r&#94;2\\) , and not some other form, like inverse cube? It is precisely, exactly, and eternally an inverse square. Why should that be? Science can never give an answer, because it is only descriptive, not pre-scriptive of nature. Science can't explain the origin of life \"Life depends on code, and information. It is impossible for information to be generated from random chemical combination, or random chance events\" Science can't explain the phenomenon of mind There is something different about man, a biological uniqueness. This includes the capacity of self knowledge, thought, reason, and intelligence. Science is unable to account for mind except as a byproduct of the brain. Evolution acts upon physical organs and organisms. Claiming that the mind is the chance product of the evolution of the brain is without meaning or significance. In addition, the mind matches the universe: the universe is rational, accessible to the mind, and describable by mathematics. I intend to write in more detail about each of these, but I think as a list they are interesting. In general, I am always wary about saying that there will be things that science will never explain. I am reminded of a quote from French positivist, Auguste Compte from 1835. In his Cours de la Philosophie Positive he wrote the following: > On the subject of stars, all investigations which are not ultimately > reducible to simple visual observations are ... necessarily denied to > us. While we can conceive of the possibility of determining their > shapes, their sizes, and their motions, we shall never be able by any > means to study their chemical composition or their mineralogical > structure ...

I regard any notion concerning the true mean > temperature of the various stars as forever denied to us. > He was clearly stating that those objects that were physically inaccessible were inaccessible to our knowledge , at least in detail. It wasn't much after that quote when spectroscopy was first used to determine the contents of stars , from the pattern of spectral lines, and the temperature was determined from the peak in the \"rainbow\" of light emitted from the stars . Further, we can determine the mass of stars from Kepler's laws and thus its density from the mass and the size. Perhaps Compte just didn't have enough imagination! It's a lesson we can all learn when dealing with challenging problems.","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2011/Dec/09/things-science-cant-explain/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2011/Dec/09/things-science-cant-explain/"},{"title":"Conversation with Steve Winsor","text":"From: Steven Winsor Subject: FW: Remember This Guy? - Genius!

My Royal Flush Ace-high scenario?). The one thing that seems to stand out for me re: 'is there a God?' is the organized structure of the Universe...and the ability for it to allow organic 'life' (which may be reasonably spread throughout this galaxies and most others). Was there some type of over-arching intelligence that created the Universe? That's what nags at me...and suggests that to declare there is no 'god' (or vastly superior intelligence capable of affecting the enormous structure of the Universe) because there is no direct proof (and there never can be presumably) is not the end of the story. Think I'll keep hedging my bet. J One other matter bears looking at. Is 'good vs. evil' simply a human-created phenomenon?...or is it circumstantial evidence that there may be that over-arching intelligence somewhere in existence? > > > Is there an intelligence behind the origin of the Universe? Bestsellers by Christopher Hitchins,Richard Dawkins and, Sam Harrishave denounced the evils of religion and proclaimed that science has shown that there is no God. Their angry accusations are partially correct. Religions have been used to justify crimes against humanity: witness the Inquisition of centuries past or the sectarian slaughter in the Mideast today. But the human misuse of religions and the existence of God are very different matters. A remarkable discovery has emerged in astrophysics: that key properties of the Universe have just the right values to make life possible. Most scientists prefer to explain away this uniqueness, insisting that a huge, perhaps infinite, number of unseen universes must therefore exist, each randomly different from the other. That way ours only appears special because we could not exist in any of the other hypothetical universes. I propose the alternative that the special properties of our universe reflect an underlying intelligence, one that is consistent with the Big Bang and Darwinian evolution. Both views are equally logical and beyond proof. However exceptional human experiences and accounts of mystics throughout the ages do suggest that we live in a purposeful universe. In The God Theory and The Purpose-Guided Universe: Believing In Einstein, Darwin, and GodI speculate on what that purpose might be... what that purpose means for our lives... how it might explain the riddle of evil. Other Books on God - Pro and Con Advances are made by answering questions. Discoveries are made by questioning answers. - Bernard Haisch Bernard Haisch, Ph.D., is an astrophysicist and author of over 130 scientific publications.

Further, we can elicit these experiences with chemical and electrical stimulation, which is strong evidence that they are the product of the functioning of the brain.

Are you suggesting that God couldn't provide it if he wanted? Are you suggesting that if God left an imprint into the universe, that it would not be directly observable? if you are, then pretty much you're conceding that there is no difference between an intelligence guiding events and natural laws guiding events, in which case there is no point to the intelligence. also, proof doesn't exist in science (only in math and philosophy). all I'm looking for is evidence, and there sure isn't any, or it's all really terrible. > * > One other matter bears looking at.

One thing that is clear, historically, is that people tend to think they are special, and build descriptions and stories around this specialness. What is also clear historically, in every case where we have been able to determine it, we are not special. Life molecules can arise from non-life - the chemistry is the same. We are on a tiny planet, not in the center of any universe, galaxy or solar system. We are one of many solar systems, probably many with life. \"heavenly matter\" is no different than \"earthly matter\" - the laws of physics are the same here as across the universe and across time. humans are primates, and are directly descended from animals that gave rise to chimps too. Our moral sense is shared, to some extent, in other animals as well. Our brains work like monkey brains and cat brains, and the parts work just like the parts of worm brains. To some, this is discouraging. I, however, find some comfort in the notion that we are all connected. See: We are all connected From: Steven Winsor Subject: RE: Remember This Guy? - Genius!

When they asked it, it was clear that they thought it was a significant argument for the benefits of religion. At the time, I didn't have the time to go into a lengthy response, so I wanted to put it here. If someone, out of a genuine concern for the suffering of other individuals, chooses to forgo research which they felt would lead to the needless suffering of those individuals, then I would support it. I could possibly criticize their assessment of the harm (i.e. would this research definitely cause harm, or at least, more harm than good? what is the cost of not pursuing the research? etc...) This is a perfectly secular rationale for the ethical decision, and we could have a discussion, but as long as their motivation was for the genuine well-being of humans (or even animals), then I don't have a problem. However, if you make the same decision because you felt that the creator of the universe wants you to do it, or you will be punished by the creator if you don't do it, or you will be rewarded by the creator for doing it then I do not support it...it may be the right decision but for the wrong reasons. The problem with making the right decision for the wrong reasons is that you would, next week, make wrong decisions for the same reasons. If you're not held to a legitimate ethical argument, grounded in the well-being of individuals and societies, then you can justify blocking stem cell research and gay marriage for the same \"reasons\" that you use to direct your own \"moral\" choices. Further, if you are allowed to simply say \"my religion tells me this is true\", then that ends all discussion. Too many people assume that just because it comes from someone's religion then is it correct, or moral, or ethical...it doesn't. We establish the evidence supporting arguments for moral actions through discussion, critical thinking, and the application of reason...towards the betterment of the conditions for all conscious creatures. When faith stands in for a reasoned ethical argument, then the result will at some point lead to seriously unethical decisions.","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2011/Dec/06/whats-wrong-with-this/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2011/Dec/06/whats-wrong-with-this/"},{"title":"Best evidence for...","text":"In preparing for a talk on Science and Religion, I came upon this somewhat amusing example.

In any other context, something with as much support as, say, the theory of relativity or the theory of evolution or the germ theory of disease would simple be called \"fact\".

Buddhism doesn't have this, neither does Hinduism, or Paganism, or etc.... not to mention atheists.

Introduction In a prior couple of posts here and here I look into the \"evil\" probability problem of the girl-named-Florida. This problem compares the following two situations: Say you know a family has two children, and further that at least one of them is a girl. What is the probability that they have two girls? and Say you know a family has two children, and further that at least one of them is a girl named Florida. What is the probability that they have two girls? The former is easy to show is \\ \\(latex {p(2g|\\\\{L1g\\\\})=1/3}&fg=000000\\\\) . The latter is shown to be \\ \\(latex {p(2g|\\\\{L1g\\\\},F)=1/2}&fg=000000\\\\) . Intuition firmly insists that knowing the name shouldn't change the probability, but the math and simulations insist otherwise. Thus, it is our duty, to try to get our intuition around the problem. I was motivated to look at this again when a commenter asked Can someone tell me what the relevance of the comparative rarity/commonness of the girl's name is? Suppose instead we knew that the girl's name was \"Mary\". The possibilities would still work out the same: B GM GM b GM GNM GM GM GNM GM After much pondering, I think I have come up with another way to recast the problem that adds to the intuition. I can't say that it makes it completely obvious to me, like the Monty Hall problem is for me now, so I think there still is something missing in my understanding of why the problem is so unintuitive . However, it does seem to push the idea a bit farther forward. In the next section I introduce another problem, with similar properties but is possibly more intuitive. I then describe how it can be used to gain an intuition on the Florida problem, and why the frequency of the name can make a difference. 2. A Card Game Say I play a game with a very small deck (just so that we can work the numbers well). The deck has 8 cards: Ace, two, three, and four of hearts and the five, six, seven, and eight of spades. Two cards are dealt, and you are given some modest information about the two cards, and asked to determine the probability that the two cards are both hearts. Let's look at three types of information given: You're only told that there are two cards. Thus, there the probability for two hearts is simply \\ \\(latex \\\\displaystyle p(2H) = \\\\frac{4}{8} \\\\times {3}{7} = \\\\frac{12}{56} \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ (1)&fg=000000\\\\) This can be seen pictorially by listing every possible two-card hand and looking at those with two hearts, yielding 12 hands out of 56. 2. You're told that at least one of the cards is a heart . Now we need to look at the first and second cards, and eliminate the possibility of two spades \\ \\(latex \\\\displaystyle p(2H|\\\\{L1H\\\\}) = \\\\frac{p(H\\_1,H\\_2)}{p(H\\_1,S\\_2)+p(S\\_1,H\\_2)+p(H\\_1,H\\_2)} \\\\ \\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ (2)&fg=000000\\\\) where \\ \\(latex {p(H\\_1,S\\_2)}&fg=000000\\\\) is that we drew a heart then a spade. We then have \\ \\(latex \\\\displaystyle \\ \\begin{array}{rcl} p(2H|\\\\{L1H\\\\}) &=& \\\\frac{\\\\frac{4}{8}\\\\times\\\\frac{3}{7}}{\\\\frac{4}{8}\\\\times\\\\frac{4}{7}+\\\\frac{4}{8}\\\\times\\\\frac{4}{7}+\\\\frac{4}{8}\\\\times\\\\frac{3}{7}}\\\\\\ &=&\\\\frac{12}{44} \\\\end{array} &fg=000000\\\\) This can be seen pictorially by listing every possible two-card hand with at least one heart and looking at those with two hearts, yielding 12 hands out of 44. You're told that at least one of the cards is an ace of hearts . Notice how this changes things. Now, when we outline the possibilities, we get \\ \\(latex \\\\displaystyle p(2H|\\\\{L1H\\\\},A) = \\\\frac{p(H\\_{1a},H\\_{2n})+p(H\\_{1n},H\\_{2a})}{p(H\\_{1a},H\\_{2n})+p(H\\_{1n},H\\_{2a})+p(S\\_{1},H\\_{2a})+p(H\\_{1a},S\\_2)} \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ (3)&fg=000000\\\\) Let's look at the numerator first. \\ \\(latex \\\\displaystyle p(H\\_{1a},H\\_{2n}) = p(H\\_{2n}|H\\_{1a})p(H\\_{1a}) \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ (4)&fg=000000\\\\) Written like this, it is like turning over card one, seeing it's an ace of hearts, and then turning over card 2. \\ \\(latex {p(H\\_{1a})=1/8}&fg=000000\\\\) , and seeing a heart that is not an ace is really the same as seeing any ol' heart, so it is \\ \\(latex {p(H\\_{2n}|H\\_{1a})=3/7}&fg=000000\\\\) . This is not any different than the previous situation. However, the next term in the numerator \\ \\(latex \\\\displaystyle p(H\\_{1n},H\\_{2a}) = p(H\\_{2a}|H\\_{1n})p(H\\_{1n}) \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ (5)&fg=000000\\\\) is really different, because we are told that there is at least one ace. The probability of drawing a heart that is not an ace on the first card is still \\ \\(latex {p(H\\_{1n})=3/8}&fg=000000\\\\) . However, drawing an ace of hearts on the second card when we drew a non-ace of hearts on the first is certain , because we have knowledge that at least one is an ace. Thus, \\ \\(latex {p(H\\_{2a}|H\\_{1n})=1}&fg=000000\\\\) . This gives, for the numerator, \\ \\(latex \\\\displaystyle p(H\\_{1a},H\\_{2n})+p(H\\_{1n},H\\_{2a})=\\\\frac{3}{7}\\\\cdot\\\\frac{1}{8} + 1\\\\cdot \\\\frac{3}{8} = \\\\frac{24}{56} \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\ (6)&fg=000000\\\\) Notice that if \\ \\(latex {H\\_{2a}}&fg=000000\\\\) had been independent of \\ \\(latex {H\\_{1n}}&fg=000000\\\\) then we would have gotten the same 12/56 term in the numerator as in the previous situation. Essentially, by giving the information that there is at least one ace, you are really making the value of one card dependent on the other, and thus knowledge of one gives you knowledge of the other and the probability for two hearts goes up. The same thing happens with \\ \\(latex {p(H\\_{2a}|S\\_1)}&fg=000000\\\\) , but since we compare to the case where we know there is one heart anyway, this is not a difference. Following through with the rest gives us \\ \\(latex \\\\displaystyle \\ \\begin{array}{rcl} p(2H|\\\\{L1H\\\\},A) &=& \\\\frac{p(H\\_{1a},H\\_{2n})+p(H\\_{1n},H\\_{2a})}{p(H\\_{1a},H\\_{2n})+p(H\\_{1n},H\\_{2a})+p(S\\_{1},H\\_{2a})+p(H\\_{1a},S\\_2)} \\\\\\\\ &=&\\\\frac{\\\\frac{3}{7}\\\\cdot\\\\frac{1}{8}+ 1 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{3}{8}}{\\\\frac{4}{7}\\\\cdot\\\\frac{1}{8}+1\\\\cdot \\\\frac{4}{8}+\\\\frac{24}{56}}\\\\\\\\ &=&\\\\frac{24}{56} = \\\\frac{6}{14} \\\\end{array} &fg=000000\\\\) This can be seen pictorially by listing every possible two-card hand with an ace of hearts and looking at those with two hearts, yielding 6 hands out of 14. 3. Back to the Florida problem The ace-of-hearts problem is exactly like the Florida problem, if you make the deck big enough. The key issue here seems to be that by giving a rare name to one of the girl children, it correlates the two children in a way that the independence assumptions in both the simpler problem and one's intuition break down. If you were to ``draw'' a girl first and not a Florida, then we must have a girl second named Florida. In the same way, the game show host in Monty Hall is forced to give information to the contestant through the rules of the game: 2/3 of the time he is forced to give the contestant the door with the prize. Another thing to notice is that the frequency of the ``aces'' (or Floridas) in the problem definitely has an effect. You can confirm this by changing the information in the card game to You're told that at least one of the cards has a rank less than three . It is easy to see how this would change the probabilities. 3.1. Intuition So why is this problem so unintuitive? I think a lot of it is related to the issues that Jeff J states in the comments. But suppose you learned what you know about this family because you meet the mother walking with her daughter, and asked her how many children she has. When she said \"two,\" this scenario fits the problem statement just as well as what Brian assumed. You know the family has two children, and that at least one is a girl. But, the probability is 1/2 that she has two daughters, not 1/3 (reference: Bar-Hillel and Falk, or look at Grinstead and Snell's on-line textbook). There is a certain ``omniscience'' assumed in the card game (not so unrealistically) and in the Florida problem (probably unrealistically) that changes the scope of the problem. Most people's intuitions are shaped by the cases like Jeff J, where we know of a specific child named Florida, and asked about the chances of having another girl which is 1/2, or even know only that there is at least one girl, but a specific one, so you get the 1/3 when thinking about it. The name, therefore, doesn't affect anything...in most realistic situations. However, in this card game it does affect the chances of having two hearts when you are restricted to the hands with at least one ace of hearts. I find that it doesn't seem to violate my intuition as badly in the card game as it does in the Florida , and much more clearly and it doesn't seem to violate our intuitions quite so badly.","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2011/Oct/30/the-florida-problem-a-new-intuition/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2011/Oct/30/the-florida-problem-a-new-intuition/"},{"title":"Faster than light...a likely solution","text":"A solution to the \"faster-than-light\" neutrinos is likely to have been found.

[...] it appears that such an attempt is doomed to failure because one of the theories they're attempting to unify is wrong. Back to the drawing board. This post is ill-informed for many reasons. Let me try to address a few. Dark Matter The concept of dark matter was not invented to keep Einstein's theory alive, it was invented to keep Newton's theory alive (which Einstein's General Theory of Relativity is consistent with, and extends to new areas). Essentially, given the form of Newton's law, we can estimate the mass of a galaxy from its spinning. It turns out that this method of measuring the mass yields 10 times the mass that we get by estimating it from the directly observed mass (i.e. from counting up the the light emitted by the mass). We then have several choices: the counting up the light method underestimates mass by a factor of 10...this is highly unlikely, because the method has been consistent with many other measurements, and is a direct consequence of fundamental laws of physics Newton's laws are wrong there is more mass than we can actually see...we give it a name, \"dark matter\", just as a place-holder until we could determine what it is. Guess what? Scientists have explored all these possibilities! The most relevant ones to this post have to do with MOND (Modified Newtonian Dynamics) . For example, Newton's law of gravity is of the form $$ F=\\frac{GMm}{r&#94;2} = ma $$ The consequences of this have been checked out many decimal places, and explains things as diverse as the tides, the formation of planetary rings, and the development of galaxies. What would it take to displace this? You'd have to modify it in such a way as to be consistent with all of the things that it predicts well, as accurately as it currently predicts, and have your modifications be consistent with some other set of observations which are inconsistent with the current theory. This is why it took 200 years to significantly modify Newton's Theory of Gravity, with Einsteins General Theory of Relativity. An example of MOND could be something like $$ F=\\frac{GMm}{r&#94;2}\\times \\mu\\left(\\frac{a}{a_o}\\right) $$ where \\(\\mu(a/a_o)\\) is a function that needs to be close to 1 for normal situations (and thus look like Newton's laws), but be different for the case of spinning galaxies. In this case there is a single parameter, \\(a_o\\) , which is a critical acceleration far above which the situation is \"normal\". Typical values are around \\( 10&#94;{-10} {\\rm m/s&#94;2}\\) , and one possible form for \\(\\mu()\\) is $$ \\mu(x) = 1-e&#94;{-x} $$ Near the Earth, this translates to $$ \\mu(x) =0.\\underbrace{99999999\\cdots}_{10&#94;{10} {\\rm nines!}} $$ On the big scale, on the outskirts of galaxies, the accelerations are comparable to \\(a_o\\) and the predictions can lead to consistent mass curves without introducing more mass. The dark matter postulate has also been, and continues to be, explored. There are some theoretical reasons to suggest that dark matter exists in the form of new fundamental particles, and there are attempts now to directly measure them. The point here is that the original post was completely wrong about the motivation to include dark matter. Further, it was wrong in implying that scientists don't examine and try to replace well-established ideas. I tell my students that it is a good day if you can demonstrate that one of your colleagues is wrong. It is an even better day if you can overturn a well-established idea (you get phone calls from Sweden for this). However, the burden is on the scientist trying to overturn a well-established idea to put forward something that is both consistent with all of the observations of the previous theory, and to demonstrate consistency on new tests that yield a different (and thus wrong) result from the old theory. Thus, it gets harder and harder to overturn an idea that is well established in science. The Speed of Light First, let me point out that Einstein doesn't say in his 1905 paper on Special Relativity that the speed of light is the maximum speed (note, this is different than General Relativity, which handles gravity...a distinction that Michael Cicchini doesn't seem to grasp). He merely asserts that the speed of light is measured to be constant in all inertial reference frames (i.e. measurements made in situations of constant speed). The derivation of the maximum speed is a consequence of this, and results in the Lorentz transformation. What we see in these equations is a factor entering in throughout of the form $$ \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v&#94;2/c&#94;2}} $$ where \\(c\\) is the speed of light, and \\(v\\) is the speed of an object. This factor goes to infinity as \\(v\\rightarrow c\\) , which places the speed limit. However, in certain circumstances, it might be that the factor takes a different form and, say, looks like $$ \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v&#94;2/c&#94;2 +10&#94;{-20}}} $$ which would allow speeds greater than the speed of light. This simplistic hack will break other parts of the theory, and so a more subtle modification would be needed, but it could certainly be done...and it wouldn't require overturning Einstein's theory. We must be particularly observant of the following two facts: relativistic quantum mechanics (QED) makes predictions so accurate, it would be like predicting the width of North America to the width of a human hair... any replacement theory would need to do as well one other significant observation of neutrinos comes from supernova explosions, many light years away. It is observed that the neutrinos reaches us at the time, or very slightly below the time that the light from the explosion reaches us. Thus, over far longer spans of space there is no observed violation of the speed of light limit. Although the neutrino story is intriguing, it does not entail the overthrow of Einstein even if it turns out to be true. More likely it will not be true, however. The biggest lesson of this is that lawyers should not speak about physics (although to be fair, Edwin Hubble, the discoverer of the expansion of the universe, was a lawyer before he became an astronomer). My bet is still on Einstein, no matter what the result of the experiment is. This isn't because I am dogmatically attached to Einstein's ideas, but that his ideas have been tested to an astonishing degree, and any replacement will have to do just as well.","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2011/Oct/14/faster-than-light-why-the-lawyer-is-wrong/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2011/Oct/14/faster-than-light-why-the-lawyer-is-wrong/"},{"title":"Mystery, Knowledge, Science and Television","text":"J J Abrams, the creator of the television show \"Lost\", gives a Ted talk where he suggests that sometimes mystery is more important than knowledge. His \"mystery box\" represents infinite possibilities and hope and that mystery is the catalyst for imagination. He sees the \"Lost\" television show as a mystery box, always with the sense of possibility. Now, to be fair, I have not actually seen Lost, so perhaps my comments are unwarranted, but I decided not to watch Lost for the following reason. When Lost was first beginning, several friends said that I would like it. I told them that I would watch it if, and only if, at the end of the series they could tell me that the \"plan\" for the series actually existed. It was claimed that the series was planned from start to finish, but my friends told me afterward that it was clear it wasn't, after watching the finale. Too many loose ends, too many mysteries. I think that J J Abrams learned the wrong lesson about mystery, as represented by his television show \"Lost\". It's not just the mystery, for the sake of mystery, it is the solving of the mystery that yields more mysteries. Scientists are comfortable with not knowing...we are constantly at the edge of what is known and not known. However, what motivates the scientist isn't the mystery, it is the solution to the mystery knowing that will open up more. There is nothing more dissatisfying than a book, movie, or television show that just opens up more and more \"mysteries\" and never resolves them...it seems artificial and disorganized. Most people assume that the mysteries will be solved by the end, so they allow themselves to be taken in by the mysteries. However, once it becomes clear that the mysteries are not going to be solved, most lose their attention and become disenchanted. What made Babylon 5 so engaging was that there was a plan, and you could count on it. You knew that if there was a mystery, that you'd see the resolution of it. I'll admit that the resolution of the main conflict (the Shadow War) was a bit disappointing, once it happened, but I think part of that feeling had to do with pace and not with the resolution itself. Mystery for the sake of mystery is enough to motivate, temporarily, but not forever. In the real world, solving mysteries opens up more...that's the real motivator! ![]","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2011/Aug/03/mystery-knowledge-science-and-television/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2011/Aug/03/mystery-knowledge-science-and-television/"},{"title":"Climate and the Moon","text":"In a prior post I criticize an article on climate which states that current climate models ignore the effect of conduction (i.e. direct contact) and convection, and focus exclusively on the greenhouse gas radiative effect. A comment to that post needs a full response. The comment in full is here: \"I almost bought your discussion until you provided the diagram from Kiehl and Trenberth which is ludicrous. The whole construct here is to create the illusion that the sun cannot heat the earth above minus 18 which is absolute nonsense based on assuming it is valid on geometric grounds to reduce the solar insolation by a factor of 4 then again by the albedo. If this is valid how then does the surface temperature of the moon reach \\~123 C - quoted by NASA. And how do you explain daytime temperatures on Earth in excess of 50 C as has been recorded ?\" I will focus on the Moon part, just because it is the easiest, but it will be natural to see how to approach this for the Earth as well. First, I must point out the irony of the comment. In trying to defend the claim that the climate models ignore conduction and convection, and focus exclusively on radiation, the comment refers to a system (the Moon) where there is no atmosphere and thus no conduction (except within the ground itself) or convection! Second I have to wonder about how stupid the commenter thinks NASA is. Do they really think that scientists would consider models that are flagrantly in conflict with the most basic observation about the Moon's surface (i.e. its temperature extremes)? Do they really think that scientists would come up with a calculation that Moon can't achieve temperatures above, say, -18 C and then stare at 100 C temperature measurements and just leave the calculation as is for decades? Let's consider how one would develop a model of the surface temperature of the Moon, and it will answer the objections raised in the comment, as well as outline how real science actually progresses. The Average Blackbody Model We start with a very simple model of a spherical body out in space receiving input from the Sun to the tune of 1400 W/m 2 . At the same time, the spherical body emits radiation with a power per square meter dependent on T 4 (i.e. the blackbody law). Notice that in this very simple model we are assuming several things: that the conduction within the body is instantaneous, thus the temperature of the body is uniform, and the output energy is uniform. the body is not rotating, so the radiation it is receiving is constant there is no atmosphere, thus no conduction or convection outside of the solid body the albedo is the average albedo of the Moon, or a=0.14. Thus this object absorbs 86% of the radiation coming in I'm not saying this is a good model, but it is a simple one that helps one understand some of the concepts at hand. We will see shortly that it has a number of shortcomings, but for now we'll see how far we can push it. This is a traditional procedure in science. You start with the simplest model you can write down, push out all the consequences you can until the model breaks, and then introduce the needed complexities to address those consequences (and no more!). Thus, you always have the simplest model that is consistent with as many of the observations that you can. The total energy out of the body would be the blackbody term shown, multiplied by the total surface area of the sphere: the radiation is outward in all directions. The incoming radiation, however, strikes only one side. Further, it strikes at different angles. Applying calculus one finds that the effective area is simply the cross-sectional area of the sphere, or the area of a circle the same size as the sphere. We can then write down the change in the temperature, which depends on the material (the mass and specific heat), given the net energy input to the body. I'll call this dependency K...its exact value, although calculable, will not be important in the model except qualitatively. We then have When the \"energy in\" is greater than \"energy out\", the temperature increases. When \"energy in\" is less than \"energy out\" the temperature decreases . Once it reaches equilibrium, temperature remains constant. What constant? That would be when dT/dt=0, or... If we look up the values for the actual Moon we get the following: So our model is not too bad, for the average value, but it could probably be improved. So, now back to the comment which motivated this all: \"If this is valid how then does the surface temperature of the moon reach \\~123 C - quoted by NASA.\" The bottom line here is that, if there is an observation that is in conflict with a model, one of the assumptions of the model is probably incorrect, or perhaps you're comparing the wrong observations to the model. We assumed that the object has a uniform temperature but we know from the 3 data points above (the min, max and mean temperatures) that this is not true! Essentially our model didn't even attempt to describe temperature variations on the surface, so it comes as no surprise that it is not consistent with them. Many times theorists will use a model, with known deficiencies, because they are interested in different questions: perhaps we are only interested in the average value, and what happens from that average value? In that case, it doesn't make a lot of sense to include complexities that will be averaged out anyway when we want to answer our question. To miss this point is to miss the entire process of comparing theory with experiment. It turns out, however, in this case we can make a few simple modifications to explore some of the temperature variation. The Infinitely Slow Surface-Conduction Model We use the same assumptions as before, with one modification (in bold): that the conduction within the body takes an infinite amount of time (i.e. no surface conduction at all) . Thus, each patch of surface acts as its own independent object the body is not rotating, so the radiation it is receiving is constant there is no atmosphere, thus no conduction or convection outside of the solid body the albedo is the average albedo of the Moon, or a=0.14. Thus this object absorbs 86% of the radiation coming in We consider two types of patches: one on the near side and one on the far side. Near-side patch Imagine a patch of surface 1 square meter, with the same albedo as the Moon (i.e. absorbing 86%), and a combined mass and specific heat summarized by a constant K'. The energy equation then becomes at equilibrium we thus have which again, is reasonably close to the real value. Notice that all we had to do is change the conduction assumption to get surface temperature variation. If you're concerned that the maximum temperature predicted is lower than the observed, notice that I am using the average albedo of the Moon. There are parts of the Moon's surface with a lower albedo, and will thus get hotter as a result. Far-side patch Now imagine a patch of surface 1 square meter, with the same albedo as the Moon (i.e. absorbing 86%), and a combined mass and specific heat summarized by a constant K' but with no sunlight at all coming in . The energy equation then becomes The only equilibrium value for this is T=0. If no energy is coming in, and we have energy going out, the object will keep cooling. So in this model we have the near side T=380 K and the far side T=0 K, at equilibrium. Although the model is clearly wrong, it demonstrates one thing: you can easily get temperatures above and below the average-model calculation simply by having not all parts of the surface heated equally, and some non-zero time of energy \"communication\" (i.e. surface conduction or, if you have an atmosphere, conduction and convection with the atmosphere) between the parts. The extreme version calculated here simply demonstrates the effect and is not meant to be realistic. Adding a Few More Complexities - Qualitative Discussion We now modify the assumptions as follows that the conduction within the body takes a finite, non-zero, amount of time the body rotates once every 28 days, like the Moon there is no atmosphere, thus no conduction or convection outside of the solid body the albedo is the average albedo of the Moon, or a=0.14. Thus this object absorbs 86% of the radiation coming in Although one could set up a simple calculation, or numerical model, to handle this case I am not going to go through the exercise. However, there are two effects that will happen when adding these two changes: the maximum temperature predicted will be a bit lower than the no-conduction model. This is primarily because the moon rotates the near-side patch out of the the most direct sunlight relatively quickly. If the surface conduction is on the order of minutes, this will make little or no difference. If it is around hours to days then it will. In fact, one could use this difference to help determine the time constant (related to the constant K') for the surface of the Moon the minimum temperature predicted will be higher than the T=0 predicted from the no-conduction model. This is both because the moon rotates the far-side patch out of the dark, and that energy from the previously warmed surface will conduct to the far-side patch. It is fairly straightforward to get a model that is nearly consistent with the observed temperature range, and is consistent with the thermal properties of the surface of the Moon. One can get even more careful by modifying assumption (4), and use the local albedo of the various patches. In addition, one would need to look at all patches on the near-side, taking into account the varying angle of inclination of the radiation. This will not modify the qualitative results. Conclusions This all started when I criticized someone's commentary on climate models, where they claimed that the models exclude thermal conduction and convection, and thus the focus on greenhouse gasses was entirely inappropriate. A further comment claimed that these models put an explicit maximum temperature achievable when they calculate the surface temperature of an object from blackbody equations. The comment further criticized my use of the average model summary for the Earth for this reason. Notice the procedure we employed to model the system, and address these concerns. We started with a very simple globally averaged model, and got an interesting temperature value similar to the data. We then added a few complexities, such a differential heating, and noticed how this gives a range of temperatures on the surface. We also noticed that the range was half right (half wrong?): the maximum was good, but the minimum was terrible. Adding rotation and non-zero conduction time gives some dynamics and can achieve reasonably close agreement. A more detailed implementation of the local albedo fixes the small errors, especially on the top end. By using this procedure, we can see exactly which parts of our model give which parts of the result. It also shows which parts of the model give the biggest effect, and which are there for small adjustments. All that is needed to go beyond the average model, and achieve temperature well above the average, is to include differential heating of the surface and some non-zero time of energy \"communication\". Once you heat different parts in different ways, and add rotations and time-delays of conductions, you get some interesting dynamics around the average , going both above and below the average. The average calculation is still useful, if you're not interested in short-term dynamics. It is further useful as a pedagogical tool, because it is a lot simpler. Thus it is not \"ludicrous\" to use the diagram from Kiehl and Trenberth, as long as one is aware that this is a globally averaged model . If you attempt to infer things well beyond the point of the model, then do not criticize the model - criticize your comparison, and look for a more detailed model that addresses the questions that you're interested in. !<>","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2011/Jul/28/climate-and-the-moon/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2011/Jul/28/climate-and-the-moon/"},{"title":"Knowledge and Belief","text":"I was just directed to this announcement concerning an NSF survey on science literacy. The bottom line is that the NSF is deciding to change the wording of two questions in the survey. The original wording is \"Human beings, as we know them today, developed from earlier species of animals,\" and \"The universe began with a huge explosion.\" . The new wording is \" According to evolutionary theory, human beings, as we know them today, developed from earlier species of animals\" and \" According to astronomers, the universe began with a huge explosion.\" (emphasis mine). It is noted that there will be a transition period with the questions, with half of the surveys containing the new questions and half the old, to determine its effect. The stated goal for this change, from the NSF, is to separate knowledge from belief. You might believe that humans are created in their present form, 6000 years ago, but the new questions try to ascertain whether you know that \"evolutionary theory\" says something different. Is this an important distinction? Is this what we really want to measure? Which is more important for a society? What is the difference between knowledge and belief? It is quite clear that there will be at least one effect for this rewording: given that the US falls way behind other countries on science literacy, especially with these particular questions, the rewording will most likely increase these numbers with no other work done. Definitions and Concepts Beliefs are representations of the world. Specifically, they are representations that we hold to be correct for the real world...as opposed to hopes, which are also representations of the world by not ones that we hold to be necessarily correct. Along with beliefs we always have a confidence in the belief, specified as a probability (either explicitly or implicitly). Knowledge is simply that collection of beliefs that we hold with such high probability or, in other words, with such confidence that we do not significantly doubt them. The belief that the sun rises in the east each morning is considered knowledge for the reason that we hold it with an extremely high probability. This is not just as a result of an inductive reasoning process (i.e. it always has, in our experience, risen in the east each morning) but because it is part of a larger body of knowledge (i.e. astrophysics) for which it is just one consequence within a whole host of other well-established predictions. Now, on to scientific literacy. The NSF defines scientific literacy as [\"knowing basic facts and concepts about science and having an understanding of how science works.\"] Why is it important? Again, [the NSF][\"knowing basic facts and concepts about science and having an understanding of how science works.\"]: \"It is valuable not only in keeping up with important science-related issues, but also in evaluating and assessing the validity of any type of information and participating meaningfully in the political process.\" The question we must ask is, does the new wording measure scientific literacy better than the old wording? To do this, we need to outline the four possible types of people answering the two forms of the questions: people who answer \"yes\" to the old and \"yes\" to the new people who answer \"no\" to the old and \"no\" to the new people who answer \"no\" to the old and \"yes\" to the new people who answer \"yes\" to the old and \"no\" to the new The wording change doesn't change cases 1 and 2, adds case 3 to the \"yes\" category and it introduces the erroneous case 4. The cases can be summarized in another way, like people who know both that, say, the universe began with a big explosion and that astronomers claim that this is true. This is indicative of scientific literacy. people who don't know, or do not believe, that the universe began with a big explosion and that don't know that astronomers claim that this is true. This is indicative of scientific illiteracy . people who don't believe that the universe began with a big explosion but know that astronomers claim that this is true. (more on this below) people who know that the universe began with a big explosion, but do not believe that astronomers claim that this is true. This might at first seem to be a totally unreasonable and marginal case, but I think it is more significant than perhaps is generally appreciated. These people might think that the new wording is a trick question (e.g. they might think that physicists , as opposed to astronomers, claim that it is true). I've had students answer questions in this way, so it is not quite as uncommon as one might think. These students overthink the problem: they know the fact, but are distracted by the extra complexity of the question, thinking that the test is trying to trick them. Case 3: The Religious Believer The only reason these particular questions were modified was because of the prevalence of religious belief. How do we know this? We don't see a proposal to change \"The Earth orbits around the Sun and takes a year to do it\" to \"According to astronomers, the Earth orbits around the Sun and takes a year to do it.\" Why? Because no religion (now) has a stake in the answer to that question, and thus have no objection to the claim. Of course, if you go back to the days of Copernicus this was a different story and people were severely punished for too strongly making such a claim. The two questions that are proposed to be changed in this way are precisely the two concepts that crop up in every creationist tract, and are clearly the two major stumbling blocks for a literalist reading of the Bible or the Quran. Aside from the motivation for the change, we can ask the question whether it is accomplishing something important anyway. Are these Case 3 people, who would answer \"no\" to the old question but \"yes\" to the new question, demonstrating scientific literacy? I don't think so. What they've confirmed is that they know that some scientists claim that the universe began with an explosion, but they don't believe it. This means that they don't accept the data, or the methods, or both. If the question were about something on the fringes of science, then perhaps this is fine, but it isn't the case with these two questions. Evolution theory, for example, is as well established as the Round Earth theory and the Germ theory of disease. To deny it is to deny all of the independent work in molecular biology, embryology, ecology, etc... which support it. Even though they may know that fact that biologists support Evolution theory, they have not demonstrated any scientific literacy in terms of \"evaluating and assessing the validity of any type of information and participating meaningfully in the political process.\" The same can be said of the Big Bang theory, to a slightly lesser degree (i.e. there isn't quite the volume of completely independent fields of study supporting it, as there is for Evolution, but the data is nearly incontrovertible anyway). To deny either idea is akin to denying the Germ theory of disease. Bottom line Imagine someone answering \"no\" to the question \"The world is round\" but answers \"yes\" to \"According to geographers, the world is round\". Would they be demonstrating scientific literacy? I don't think so. Do we want to pander to the religious-motivated ignorance in this country, for the sake of increasing the appearance of scientific literacy? I don't think so. ![]","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2011/Jul/27/knowledge-and-belief/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2011/Jul/27/knowledge-and-belief/"},{"title":"Science and Attitudes Toward Criticism","text":"So this morning I got a strong criticism of my post, \"The Not-so-Hidden Flaw in this Climate Argument\" , which itself is a criticism of someone else's criticism of a climate model (got all that?). I only had a very brief moment to look at the comment, but it put me in a good mood...a mood that I don't think would be held by a similar-type criticism in a non-science arena. I think there is a very big difference between the way a scientist, through training, perceives and handles criticism which was exemplified with my mood this morning. Let me try to explain. It is a very good day for a scientist to go in to work, and to demonstrate that one of his colleagues is wrong. It's even better if the wrong idea/theory/model is one that is popular! For those scientists to adequately demonstrate that a popular idea is wrong, we have for them the Nobel Prize. Of course, it is very hard to demonstrate that a well-established idea is wrong because, by definition, a well-established idea in science is one where many many smart people have tried to show it is wrong and have failed. For those people who claim that scientists have a conspiracy to uphold popular scientific ideas (a criticism creationists level against the support of evolution), they completely miss the goals of every scientist. It is also a good day when someone criticizes your idea. In the comment on my post, the criticism took the form of \"if your idea is correct, how do you explain the following observation...\". Awesome! Why? First, someone bothered to read my post, and found it important/interesting enough to comment...that always makes me happy. Secondly, I'm now in a win-win situation. There are 3 possibilities: the criticism is flat out wrong, and I get a chance to both teach something, and to bolster my idea...I can be a bit more confident in my idea. the criticism is partly correct, and I get a chance to add a bit of nuance, or explore a part of my idea that I hadn't fully considered the criticism is correct, and I have learned something about the world and have to modify my thinking (at the expense of scrapping my idea). Each of these 3 possibilities is wonderful, and it put me in a good mood! In contrast, most people when criticized (think politics, sports, religion, etc...) get defensive. They don't look forward to the possibility that they might be wrong, and may need to modify their thinking. I prefer the scientific perspective!

He starts with examples like \"alien visitations to the healing power of eskimo rituals\", and states that there is \"no price for them to pay for believing\" in these ridiculous things. \"They still enjoy the fruits of science, from iPads to modern medicine, even as they profess belief in ideas without any sound basis.\" Further, \"Science is not a lunch buffet. Yes, the individual results on small, focused issues like the coffee-bad/coffee-good debate may flip back and forth.

I am never completely serious, but it is frustrating to see the dichotomy.

I am not entirely convinced by the climate data that the situation is as dire as is claimed. I am not sure whether the climate scientists have provided a clear enough picture, without distortion, cherry-picking, and exaggeration. I don't have to deny all of physics, chemistry, and biology to hold this position as creationists have to do.

I am not happier because of that knowledge. My life is no better, nor my parents or my future children.[...] For me, in the end I don't see how it benefits humanity. I would much rather see that time and intellect spent on pursuing ways to improve global living standards, protect the environment, create a better education system, etc...\" My response: There are several things I could say about this. People are notoriously horrible at predicting which lines of intellectual pursuits will yield real practical results (i.e. direct benefits to humanity). For example, in the late 1800's there was some work done on some pretty obscure mathematical concepts in wave mechanics. At the time there were very few practical results foreseen from this work, if any. However, it later became the foundation for telecommunications, which arguably makes up the bulk of the global economy today. There are many examples like this. That's why it's always good to have basic research funded well, even if it seems frivolous at the time. Knowledge matters, no matter what it is. Your example about how you don't care how big the universe is, for instance. Let's look at a couple of contrasting beliefs, and their consequences to things like protecting the environment, something you state is important. Person A believes that the world was created specifically for humans, 6000 years ago, and that this creator is making sure things are going along well for his followers (i.e. granting miracles, giving guidance, etc...) Person B believes that the Jesus is going to come again in this lifetime, and the world will end in glory. Person C knows how big the universe really is. This means that person C realizes that 1) the Earth is a relatively small place and 2) there isn't anywhere else we can go if things get messed up here. Which person do you think would be most willing to make difficult decisions to protect the environment for the next, say, 200-300 years? There are benefits to \"frivolous\" science. One benefit is in critical thinking, no matter what the topic. Another benefit is the philosophical placement of humans in the grander scheme of things. This can have direct *practical* effects on humanity, and its future. On any topic, truth beats untruth. !<>","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2011/May/28/frivolous-research-in-science/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2011/May/28/frivolous-research-in-science/"},{"title":"Energy Bracelet Experience","text":"I've spoken before about the energy balance bracelets and how they don't work. I just had an experience at a local flower show where I ran into a vendor of the bracelets. He enthusiastically invited me to a demonstration, exactly like the demos I'd seen before. He was even cooperative when I asked to do the demonstration on him. When I proceeded to knock him over while he was wearing the bracelet (he claimed that I was pushing outward) and failed to knock him over when he wasn't (he claimed I was pushing inward), he didn't look too happy. When I pointed out that that was how it worked, he started trying to quote studies, and I amiably walked away. I am not sure what the best thing to do with these people. I thought about doing what Richard Saunders does, and wear 10 of them (buying them in bulk) and handing them out with a demonstration. That might get me thrown out. Someone suggested I contact the media, a month or so ahead of time for the flower show, and get them to do an investigative piece. Another thing I may do is, if they are willing, is to suggest a very simple blinded experiments. The nice thing about the balance bracelets is that they claim some very simple, reproducible effects. As a result, it is pretty easy to test it in the confines of a vendor booth at a flower show. I will need to come prepared with two identical little bags, and a fake bracelet, in order to do the test. Also, if they claim improved balance, it'd be nice to have a balance test where the the seller is not involved...something like a balance beam, perhaps. I feel confident that I can be a real pain, yet not involve lawyers, in a case like this. !<>","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2011/Mar/09/energy-bracelet-experience/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2011/Mar/09/energy-bracelet-experience/"},{"title":"Religion, Scripture, and the Source of Morality","text":"It is a common argument now from the so-called new atheists that we don't get our morality from scripture. I am not sure that many religious people, even biblical literalists, would defend such a claim...so in a way it really is a strawman. Francis Collins, following CS Lewis, place morality front and center in their justification for their belief in God, but at no time do they say that it comes from scripture . They claim that morality is, in essence, programmed into us as a gift from the divine creator. The universality of altruism is used in an argument from Collins for a behavior that cannot be selected for, and is thus an indication of a supernatural, moral creator. He never once says that the morality comes from scripture. Seen in this way, then scripture forms a guide which may need to be interpreted for the changing times, even if you are a literalist. I think it would be wiser for the new atheists to ask if scripture can even be a good guide for behavior, without hammering the (strawman) point that scripture is not the source of morality. Perhaps they should poll their audience on the question of where they believe morality comes from. If a significant fraction states that it comes from scripture, then it no longer is a strawman.

One article on CNN says \"Watson doesn't really ‘think' anything, and it struggles with simple questions that most humans can answer without a second thought.\" They continue, \"a question like ‘If a snowman melts and later refreezes, does it turn back into a snowman?' would be nearly impossible for a statistical reasoning program to tackle.\" Another article on NPR compares Watson to a plant. \"Watson, biologically speaking, if you get my drift, is a plant. Watson is big and it is rooted. Like all plants, it is deaf, blind, and immobile; it is basically incapable of directing action of any kind on the world around it.\" Continuing, \"Giving a plant a camera won't make it see, and giving it language won't let it think. Which is just a way of reminding us that Watson understands no language. Unlike the ant, who acts as though it has reasons for its actions, Watson acts like a plant that talks.\" I think both authors are pretty glib at stating that Watson doesn't think like us. I am not entirely convinced. When Deep Blue defeated Kasparov in chess, it was stated that Deep Blue doesn't play chess like a person plays chess. This is true. Deep Blue simply tries all of the possibilities, good, bad, and stupid. Chess masters don't even see bad moves. Watson is another matter. Sure it compares the words in the question to a big database, but it is doing probabilistic reasoning at its core. This is exactly what people do. So Watson can't handle very abstract questions, like the concept of melting snowmen, but could a child who has never experienced snow make this leap? We make this leap because we've been presented, throughout our life, with a regular universe and our brain has made an internal model of that universe. Watson, too, has an internal model for its universe but the difference is that Watson's universe is sensory impoverished and conceptually limited. Watson certainly cannot think as well as we humans, but that is a limitation more of its hardware and the training environment that it is in. But in many ways, Watson thinks just like us. ![]","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2011/Feb/23/does-watson-think/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2011/Feb/23/does-watson-think/"},{"title":"Creationism and Strawmen","text":"I can't tell you how much I cringe when I hear people say, \"I just can't imagine how we developed our complexity through random chance\" and similar things, referring (incorrectly) to the \"random\" process of evolution. This is a strawman argument that is put forward: either total random chance or God. Creationists often do this, but it is also done on the other side. Take, for example, a recent post I saw on Facebook from one of my friends: ...poses a direct challenge to all creationists. Provide an explanation for vestigial features of living organisms without inadvertently proving evolution. He was surprised to learn that Answers in Genesis, the go-to place for all things creationist, had a position on vestigial features . That description made use of arguments from molecular biology, and so-called microevolution. It seems as if it is a common misunderstanding that creationists reject all of the apparatus of evolution and microbiology, and a simple, strawman statements like \"creationists reject evolution\" don't hold. It really does help to look at the best arguments from each side, to really see the limits of the analysis. Going back and forth between Talk Origins and Answers in Genesis is a good way to explore the arguments. For example, in transitional fossils we look in Answers in Genesis and find articles like this one and this one which steep of arguments from authority, claims without evidence, and cherry-picking. Many of the arguments rest on criticizing small details on a small number of fossils. In the talk origins article on transitional fossils , we get a very detailed, and seemingly complete, list of transitions from all major animal types. It comes in many parts, and details the characteristics on each transition. Try it yourself! Pick a topic, go through and find the best arguments each has. It's a very good exercise.

Since I became an atheist 20 years ago, I never once regretted the decision. There hasn't been anything at all that has moved me from that perspective, until this week. I've seen the light, and I've realized that in some ways it was the wrong decision to become an atheist. I think it was what I needed at the time, and now it is not. I even changed my Facebook profile! So, what changed my mind? Sam Harris did, in his lecture on the \"Problem with Atheism\". Essentially, it boils down to the fact that we don't need a word for not believing in something, and that to attach a charged word to it undermines the position. We don't need, as he says, a name for \"non-astrologer\". We just need to espouse the positive virtues of believing with sufficient evidence, for the quantification of uncertainty, of intellectual honesty and consistency. So, in an effort to be more positive about my beliefs in evidence, rationality, and science, from now on I am not going to consider myself an atheist. If someone asks me if I believe in God, I will say I don't believe in Zeus, Thor or Yahweh (or any of the other gods we've heaped on that pile we call mythology).

When Deep Blue defeated Kasparov , and the computer became (unofficially) the world chess champion, I remember having mixed feelings. We like our icons, I suppose, and hate to get rid of them. It's like growing up, and losing Santa Claus, perhaps. The history of science has been to deflate human arrogance, and yet successes like Deep Blue and Watson are not quite the same because it is our own ingenuity which created them. On some level, Watson feels like a different accomplishment than Deep Blue. Chess is deterministic, well formulated, and complex. It's complexity is the only thing that challenges an easy computer solution, which was accomplished finally by brute force: get enough fast hardware attacking a well-described problem and you win....always. Watson isn't nearly as well defined as chess, or at least it doesn't appear to be as well defined. Watching Watson , there is a creepy sort of feeling, probably due to too many evil AI movies (2001, Terminator, Matrix, etc...). Kids growing up today will have this sort of technology as the norm.

You can't explain that.\". I think, however, David is completely ineffectual at conveying his point and looks like a jerk. As a followup, Bill responds to a letter in this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyHzhtARf8M Here he concedes that the Moon causes the tides, but then adds a number of other questions: Where did the Moon come from? Where did the Sun come from? There is order in the universe. Where did we, in all of our intricacies come from? Why life on this planet and not on the other planets? He states that, given this observed order in the universe, that it takes more faith to believe this was all luck, rather than in God. Although many scientists would laugh at these questions, that is the wrong response. These are reasonable questions! They are ignorant and (because Bill should have done a bit of research before asking them), uninformed questions but they are reasonable first-questions one asks. If one is honest about getting answers (which I don't think Bill is), there are ready answers to these direct questions but it seems to me that the intent of the questions is a bit different. First he says we can't explain the tides. So we explain the tides, with gravity and the Moon. Then he asks \"where did the Moon come from?\" He could have just as easily asked \"where did gravity come from?\". It is clear from this line of questioning that there will never be a final answer to satisfy him. Each time we answer one, there will be concepts that that one builds on, etc... This is classic God-of-the-Gaps , but it is something that I think needs to be dealt with in a more subtle way than David Silverman and many other atheists seem to do. I think most people, rightly, have a sense of wonder about the amazing order in the universe. I think most people immediately attach this order to a creator, the nearest cultural deity, because they don't have any alternative: they are not informed. In order to dissuade them, I don't think that insulting their deity is effective because they take that as insulting their sense of wonder, and then science seems like a sterile, arrogant, unimaginative bully. We need to find a way to enhance their sense of wonder, and yet dismantle the notion that this requires some external deity. We need to keep the spirituality, as a secular notion espoused by Carl Sagan, Sam Harris and others, because that is what is really driving the issues for most people and we need to push the use of the deity farther and farther away from daily life.

Sure, the climate change folks think that denying it is like denying the holocaust or denying evolution, but it really isn't nearly at that level. There are not the number of independent investigations and data supporting man-influenced climate change as there are for either evolution or the holocaust, even if the science were completely unambiguous on the topic (which it isn't).

He stated that, on a flat Earth, with the light from a far-away object like the Sun all shadows would be the same length. Seeing different-length shadows, as Eratosthenes did in his famous Summer Solstice observation, allows you to infer curvature. But the big assumption here is that the light is coming from very far away. If we had a flat Earth, it is easy to set up a situation where the Sun, directly overhead in some place, casts a 7 degree angle 800 km away as Eratosthenes observed. This simple arrangement results in a distance to the Sun of about 6500 km. The world is flat! So, we have two different explanations of the observations. How do we distinguish between them? Answer: the way it is always done in science - spin out the consequences of each, and make predictions where they disagree. It is easy to show that continuing this calculation would result in some striking predictions. First, given this distance, and the fact that shadows change over the day, the apparent size of the Sun would be very different from one location and another...and it is never observed to be different, even across years. This suggests a very distant Sun. Further, you'd have to make sure that the Moon was closer than the Sun (inferred from eclipses) in both models. Once you do this, then you have two objects with the apparent size problem in the flat-Earth model, again not supported by observation. There are probably many other predictions this model makes which could easily have been verified by the ancients, so it is no surprise that they did not consider it in their calculations. It is useful, however, to think about the consequences of models beyond the data they agree with. !<>","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2011/Feb/11/the-world-is-flat/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2011/Feb/11/the-world-is-flat/"},{"title":"A modest proposal about uncertainty","text":"Joan Roughgarden in Beyond Belief made a very astute observation of a problem, and then proposed a lousy solution to it. The problem she was addressing had to do with the public perception of evolution as something quite uncertain scientifically (\"theory vs fact\"). She observed that the public sees science changing its stance on many things, especially in medicine. One day, you should eat bran. The next, bran is bad for you. The next, bran is good for you again. As a result the public observes that some sciences are uncertain, and can't distinguish one field from another or one type of claim from another, so they apply doubt to all of science even when it is not warranted by the science. Her solution involves using religious analogies, interpreting phrases in the Bible to explain things like natural selection and mutations, in order to communicate it to a group of people who share and value that vocabulary. Dawkins rightly chews her out for this approach, pointing out how far she is stretching the meaning of the phrases just to fit her philosophy. The problem she is stating, however, is quite real. How can we expect the public to make decisions about medicine, global warming, evolution, the big bang, etc... when they (somewhat rightly, somewhat wrongly) observe that the scientists themselves are arguing about it? The Intelligent Design folks are currently using this observation to sow doubt with the public in their efforts to \"teach the controversy\" of evolution to inject creationism into the schools. It is a failure of the scientists, and the media that covers them, to communicate with the public. Can we do better? I have a proposal, which I'll sketch out in a toy example. The problem is not the communication of facts, or even of the procedures of science. The problem is with the communication of uncertainties . In day to day life, we easily handle claims with different levels of uncertainties. The sun rises in the east each morning has low uncertainty. The claims of the auto salesman or the politician have higher uncertainty. Quantifying it is, of course, more challenging but the qualitative features of uncertainty are known to nearly everyone. So scientists and journalists really need to take efforts to communicate the uncertainty of every claim, not just the fact of the claim or how the new observations differ from the old observations. How could this be done? I think, at least roughly, one should include a plot of the probability distribution with any claim. One doesn't need to know advanced math to see the picture. If every claim is accompanied by a plot of the uncertainties, the public will get used to reading them. Let me demonstrate with a toy example. Say, I am trying to determine the origin year of homo sapiens. I realize there isn't just one year, and there is a process, but it is not much harder to include those in this simple analysis. I have several homo sapiens fossils where I've measured the age, which allows me to calculate my best guess of the age, and the distribution of my uncertainty shown here. I've used a normal, Gaussian, distribution here although in fact it probably should be something skewed left and probably a lot flatter to reflect our greater uncertainty with age, and that we have other observations that put confident lower limits on the origin of homo sapiens. Again, the details aren't important because all attempts at clarifying the distribution only further help with communicating the uncertainty to the public. A few observations are in order here: there are many possible values for the origin that lie well outside of our data yet have non-zero probability Our \"best guess\" is around the middle of this distribution, but it really can't be interpreted as \"homo sapiens originated 250,000 years ago\" as it might read in a newspaper Now, we have a new paper that adds another fossil much older than than the previous ones, around 340000 years ago. Newspapers may claim \"origin of homo sapiens 150% older than originally thought\", or \"estimates of the origin of humans overthrown by new data\". How might it look with the uncertainties plotted? There are a number of lessons that can be read from this. the new data updates our \"best estimate\" by only a little - the old data, combined with the new data, are used for the estimate our uncertainties have widened - by having a larger range of data, our uncertainties may have increased with new data. In reality, estimating an origin (first event) will update a bit differently than this example shows. For example, the uncertainties in the right-half of the distribution may not be affected at all by an older observation. If this data were in medicine, however, and we were estimating the effect of some new treatment, then the update would be very similar. A single result of a strong effect may not increase our best estimate for that effect by a huge amount. The uncertainties in many medical treatments, or dietary recommendations, straddle the origin: there is significant probability for no effect . It would be fruitful to see the plot of uncertainties, pushed a little this way and that, updated in perhaps a wiki style by scientists as new data come in. There would be many lessons, all of which would help the public understanding of science. observations rarely overturn well-supported scientific understanding not all topics have equal uncertainties - doubting everything the same amount is not rational certainty is never an option, but sometimes the uncertainty is so low that there is a practical certainty nature itself, not authority, determines our best guess and some of our uncertainty if the thing you are measuring has a small effect, then you should expect a series of measurements of the effect to change sign: bran is good, bran is bad, bran is good, etc.... This doesn't mean that the scientists are waffling, it only means that the effect is small and difficult to detect - and probably meaningless. I think the public could learn to, at least qualitatively, understand and use plots like these. Perhaps there is a better way to display it that does not do violence to the truth, and I'd be open to that. I think getting in the habit of making plots like this would be good for the scientist as well, forcing them to address and communicate the actual uncertainties in their claims. !<>","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2011/Jan/29/a-modest-proposal-about-uncertainty/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2011/Jan/29/a-modest-proposal-about-uncertainty/"},{"title":"The Economics of Religion: More good than harm?","text":"There are some that argue that religion should be eliminated because of all of the harm it does, such as the suicide bombings, honor killings, the Inquisition, etc... This includes the \"New Atheists\", like Sam Harris and Richard Dawkins. Others counter that this one-sided perspective ignores all of the good that religion does, such as support for people when they are ill, the donations to natural disaster funds, etc... They argue that religion does more good than harm. This sort of argument is used in economics, and is similar (although not identical to) a cost-benefit analysis. One can focus on, for example, the harm that cars bring in pollution and pavement like environmentalists do or one can focus on the benefits of cars like the access to better health care, the allowance of critical population densities to support significant industries like the industry reps would do. An economist would then weigh both sides, benefits minus costs, and see which to prefer. In order to do this with religion one cannot simply take the good of religion subtract the bad, come up with a positive number, and say that religion is a benefit to society. It's like saying that the treatment for the measles is two aspirin and some juice resulting in more cases of recovery than death and saying that we shouldn't replace this treatment with something else. As is turns out, for the measles, a vaccine will prevent nearly all contractions of the disease, and virtually all deaths. If we replace religion with a rational perspective (as Sam Harris proposes), which includes a respect for spiritual experiences but not the supernatural explanations of them, then it may be that we essentially vaccinate people against such behavior as suicide bombings, honor killings and inquisitions. !<>","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2011/Jan/29/the-economics-of-religion-more-good-than-harm/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2011/Jan/29/the-economics-of-religion-more-good-than-harm/"},{"title":"Rounds in Australian Open","text":"In a previous post , I included predictions for Round 1 of the Australian Open.

I need to go back and re-listen to some of them, but I was struck by the attached clip from the very end of Session 4 . In this 5-minute audio clip, Darren Schreiber , UCSD Political Science, make the point that science shows little humility. He continues to claim that his religion is what motivates him for humility, to face the unknown with a humble, searching perspective. His comments are followed up by Ann Druyan , the wife of the late Carl Sagan, in which she essentially says that science and its methods promote the utmost humility. We are not afforded absolute truths, and if whatever knowledge that we are most confident in gets disproved then science will give its highest honor to the person disproving it. She points out that science brings us out of a childish narcissism, a key part of nearly all religions, which demands that we are central to the universe. http://www.google.com/reader/ui/3523697345-audio-player.swf?audioUrl=https://sites.google.com/site/bblais/AnnDruyanResponds.mp3?attredirects=0&d=1 ![]","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2011/Jan/14/religion-science-and-humility/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2011/Jan/14/religion-science-and-humility/"},{"title":"Francis Collins, Science and Religion: How Religion Halts Science","text":"In reading Francis Collins ' book, \" The Language of God \", I was struck by the way in which the religious claims enter into the scientific discussion. There were three main arguments that he used: The parameters of the universe (e.g. speed of light, gravitational constant, etc...) are extremely finely tuned for the support of living beings, and is unexplainable through science Our sense of morality (especially pure altruism) is unexplainable from the perspective of evolution Our universal longing for God is unexplainable from the perspective of evolution and rational thought Each of the arguments has the same form: \"I don't know how to currently explain something, therefore it is unexplainable in principle, therefore there must be a God.\" Taken to its extreme, we can find Colbert's summary \"There must be a God, because I don't know how things work.\" particularly appropriate. It's really a bold religious statement, ironically full of the arrogance that religious people often attribute to scientists. By saying that our current knowledge cannot explain something, therefore it can never be explained, is stating that you know better than all other future generations of people. The problem with the statements, however, is not the arrogance. It is that they are show-stoppers: once you make the claim that something is unexplainable, then you stop looking. So-called Intelligence Design suffers from the same problem: by saying that a designer is needed to create the stated irreducibly complex mechanisms, then there is no use in searching for an explanation. It stops science, stops curiosity, stops investigation. These types of arguments, then, are not just wrong they are dangerous because they stop the types of inquiry that could possibly show that they are wrong. In this way, they have a tendency to protect themselves in the world of memes. I am not saying that we have answers to points 1-3 above (although I think we have some very good ideas at least for 2 and 3), but to go from ignorance to \"God must have done it\" is extremely sloppy logic, if it can be called logic at all. ![]","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2011/Jan/10/francis-collins-science-and-religion-how-religion-halts-science/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2011/Jan/10/francis-collins-science-and-religion-how-religion-halts-science/"},{"title":"A Moral Argument for God","text":"I recently listened to an interview with Francis Collins on Point of Inquiry, concerning his book The Language of God: A Scientist Presents Evidence for Belief . Francis Collins is an icon of the \"scientist who is also Christian\" (along with Ken Miller ). He's a converted atheist, now evangelical Christian, but is pro-evolution, director of the NIH, and the former director of the Human Genome Project. I was immediately struck by two things: he was converted to Christianity primarily by the arguments in Mere Christianity , by C.S.Lewis. In this book, one of the main arguments centers around the Moral Law, it's universality and internal (to the human) nature of it. I'll go into that more later. he is obviously a very smart guy, so his opinions (especially on evolution) need to be taken seriously (at least once). So when he claims that the Moral Law cannot be the product of evolution, one had to at least not write that comment off immediately. So, I went back and read Mere Christianity, which I had done in college some years back. I had an immediate visceral reaction against it, as he laid out these philosophical arguments that seemed much more like word games and bald assertions than anything approaching truth. I admit that I am steeped in the methods of science, and find arguments that claim surety yet are not testable to be empty. In reading Francis Collins' book, I have found that his arguments are essentially identical to Lewis', but couched in more modern scientific language. (As a footnote, I was, pleasantly surprised to see that Lewis lumped evolution with gravitation in describing laws of nature.) Moral Law and the Argument for God The definition of Moral Law here is: \"denunciations of oppression, murder, treachery and falsehood; the same injunctions of kindness to the aged, the young, and the weak, of almsgiving and impartiality and honesty\" [pg 24, Collins quoting from Lewis) The argument for God based on the Moral Law takes on three components. The three components of the argument are the following: Moral Law is universal to all human cultures. Moral Law includes pure altruistic behavior (think Mother Theresa or Oskar Shindler here), which cannot be explained by evolution Moral Law is internal to humans. (There is a fourth point, which Lewis ties specifically to Christianity, which is that we often choose not to obey this Moral Law. This sets up the idea of free will, and the idea of sin.) Why is altruism a problem for evolution? Collins writes: Agape, or selfless altruism, presents a major challenge for the evolutionist. It is quite frankly a scandal to reductionist reasoning. It cannot be accounted for by the drive of individual selfish genes to perpetuate themselves. Quite the contrary: it may lead humans to make sacrifices that lead to great personal suffering, injury, or death, without any evidence of benefit. And yet, if we carefully examine that inner voice we sometimes call conscience, the motivation to practice this kind of love exists within all of us, despite our frequent efforts to ignore it. He outlines three common evolutionary arguments for the origin of Moral Law: One proposal is that repeated altruistic behavior of the individual is recognized as a positive attribute in mate selection. But this hypothesis is in direct conflict with observations in nonhuman primates that often reveal just the opposite—such as the practice of infanticide by a newly dominant male monkey, in order to clear the way for his own future offspring. Another argument is that there are indirect reciprocal benefits from altruism that have provided advantages to the practitioner over evolutionary time; but this explanation cannot account for human motivation to practice small acts of con- science that no one else knows about. A third argument is that altruistic behavior by members of a group provides benefits to the whole group. Examples are offered of ant colonies, where sterile workers toil incessantly to create an environment where their mothers can have more children. But this kind of \"ant altruism\" is readily explained in evolutionary terms by the fact that the genes motivating the sterile worker ants are exactlythe same ones that will be passed on by their mother to the siblings they are helping to create. [pg 27-28] So, if you accept these points, then Collins writes: If the Law of Human Nature cannot be explained away as cultural artifact or evolutionary by-product, then how can we account for its presence? There is truly something unusual going on here. To quote Lewis, \"If there was a controlling power outside the universe, it could not show itself to us as one of the facts inside the universe—no more than the architect of a house could actually be a wall or staircase or fireplace in that house. The only way in which we could expect it to show itself would be inside ourselves as an influence or a command trying to get us to behave in a certain way. And that is just what we do find inside ourselves. Surely this ought to arouse our suspicions?\" Encountering this argument at age twenty-six, I was stunned by its logic. Here, hiding in my own heart as familiar as anything in daily experience, but now emerging for the first time as a clarifying principle, this Moral Law shone its bright white light into the recesses of my childish atheism, and de- manded a serious consideration of its origin. Was this God looking back at me? [pg 29] An Analogy When I read arguments of this sort, especially the last quote from Lewis, I am offended by the confidence of the language from a totally flimsy and untestable statement: \"The only way in which we could expect [a controlling power] to show itself would be inside ourselves as an influence or a command trying to get us to behave in a certain way\" [emphasis mine]. Really? How do you get that? How can you test that claim? How do you know what options are open for a controlling power? Aren't you already assuming that there is something inside us, beyond natural law (i.e. dualism), in order for this to be true? I'd like to propose an analogy. I am not sure how far this will go, and where it will break down (as all analogies do), but I think it makes a point. There is a universal law, which I will call the Eating Law. According to this law we as humans have an internal voice telling us that we want to eat fatty foods. The Eating Law is universal to all human cultures. We differ on the specifics, but we all have the voice telling us what we want to eat (i.e. pringles, Big Macs, etc...) Eating Law includes pure gluttony as a behavior (think people who eat themselves to obesity and death) which cannot be explained by evolution. how could behavior that reduces life expectancy, mating probability, and health possibly be selected for? There are people who eat so much they can't even move! Eating Law is internal to humans. We can look at the eating behavior, but we'll never be able to observe the actual urge to eat fatty foods. We often choose not to follow this law (i.e. we choose to eat salad instead of Big Macs) This is not simply hunger, which we can see in other animals. It is an urge to eat, even when you're not hungry, fatty foods. Now, re-read Lewis: \"If there was a controlling power outside the universe, it could not show itself to us as one of the facts inside the universe—no more than the architect of a house could actually be a wall or staircase or fireplace in that house. The only way in which we could expect it to show itself would be inside ourselves as an influence or a command trying to get us to behave in a certain way. And that is just what we do find inside ourselves. Surely this ought to arouse our suspicions?\" Now, we have two such laws, the Eating Law and the Morality Law. Which one is the message from the creator? How could we test this? I could probably come up with more examples of universal tendencies which take the form of internal messages to humans, but I don't need to. Coming up with just one is enough to show how this argument is completely empty. I am perplexed that someone as smart as Francis Collins can't see this. I am further perplexed that someone would be \"shocked by the logic of this argument\". ![]","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2010/Dec/30/a-moral-argument-for-god/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2010/Dec/30/a-moral-argument-for-god/"},{"title":"Are Science and Religion Incompatible?","text":"I've recently found pointofinquiry.org , which has a lot of very interesting talks about science and religion, so it got me thinking again. Some of the more interesting talks are: http://www.pointofinquiry.org/richard_dawkins_science_and_the_new_atheism/ http://www.pointofinquiry.org/ann_druyan_carl_sagan_and_the_varieties_of_scientific_experience/ http://www.pointofinquiry.org/pz_myers_jennifer_michael_hecht_chris_mooney_new_atheism_or_accommodation/ First off, I need to point out that I am an atheist as well as a scientist. Did my learning of science undermine my religion (I was raised Roman Catholic)? Was I jaded about religion before learning science? Does science promote atheism? These are some of the questions one needs to consider with respect to these ideas. Given my one data point, I can only state a correlation, not a cause-and-effect: that as I got older, and learned more science, I got less religious. However, I can point out several observations I've made about the interplay between religion and science. I think some of the hard-line atheists, in their own personal zeal, make claims about science that are overreaching and not entirely correct. I also think that the accommodationist perspective, stating that science is perfectly compatible with religion is also not correct. Here are my main thoughts. Science is in conflict with some religions If you believe that the world is 8000 years old, then you are wrong. Almost all branches of science, from physics, chemistry, biology and geology, agree that the Earth is billions of years old. There really is extremely little wiggle room there. Of course, one can always say that God made the world appear billions of years old, but in fact it really is only 8000 years old. If you do that, then you could just as easily state that the world was made yesterday. Further, it is a challenge to think of a reason why this deception would be need to be done. Finally, from a scientific point of view, it is content-free (CF): it makes no measurable predictions, does not suggest the next measurements to be done, nor is it testable in any way. Science has demonstrated, historically, that CF statements have always turned out to be the equivalent of nothing. If your religion depends on insisting that the world is 8000 years old, then science is in direct conflict with it. Those religions that have put themselves in the cross-hairs of science, by making specific statements about the universe, are making the error of making the religion able to be falsified. Historically speaking, this is exactly what has always happened with testable religious claims: science shows them to be wrong. The religion then has two choices reject science (usually hypocritically at the same time reaping all the benefits of science, such as longer life, better health, and increased technology) call those statements metaphorical, and remove the testable part of the religion that was rejected by science Most liberal religious faiths have tended to choose (2). The Catholic Church, for instance, has a pro-evolutiuon stance and is in-line with science on many things (a departure from historical behavior). In choice (2), the Genesis creation story is allegorical and not literal, and thus not in conflict with modern biology, especially evolution. They merely state that God had a hand in the process, perhaps, for example, injecting souls into humans some million years ago. The conservative religious faiths which believe in the literal Genesis story, with creation in 7 days about 8000 years ago, try to replace evolution with creationism (in the form of, so-called, intelligent design). They are just plain wrong. Further, because they've stated that their religions depend on evolution being false, they have thus made it possible for science to demonstrate they are wrong. They have then created the conflict between their religion and science. Other religious claims that are testable, and shown to be false, include: faith healing intercessory prayer special creation Science is not in conflict with some other religions...but with a caveat There are many scientists who are religious. Some relatively famous modern ones include Ken Miller , a Catholic biologist from Brown University who testified in the Dover Evolution vs Intelligent Design trial, Francis Collins , the geneticist, and the physicist Freeman Dyson . In each of these cases, we have to be careful in defining their belief. Conservative Christians will often point to highly prominent scientists (such as Albert Einsten) who are religious as evidence of no conflict between science and religion. However none of these people support the anti-science agenda of the conservative Christians, and most believe in a vague, impersonal \"God\", such as \"God\" representing the mystery in the universe. A far cry from the person-like entity described in the Bible, but by using the same word (God), these scientists have inadvertently played into the hands of people who would like to misuse the belief for their own purposes. What is comes down to, as you look at religious scientists (which represent a very small minority) , there are two types: scientists that are in fields far away from the \"big-picture\" questions (like, say, material science) and can thus maintain two opposite viewpoints at the same time. People are very good at compartmentalizing their thinking. scientists who have scientifically untestable religious beliefs. this includes the \"God=universe\" belief, or some vague spiritual belief. Ken Miller falls into this category too...when asked whether Jesus had a Y chromosome (which could test for the virgin birth, for example), he says that he just doesn't have any data on that. Even though some of his tests are, in theory, testable they aren't testable right now and perhaps, practically, never. But shouldn't science stay out of religious issues? Don't they speak about different things? Stephen J. Gould (the great) used to refer to \"non-overlapping magisteria\" when speaking about science and religion. Freeman Dyson refers to science and religion as \"two windows that people look through, trying to understand the big universe outside, trying to understand why we are here.\" I have already touched on part of the problem with this: where religion is testable , it has been shown to be false . All that is left are the untestable parts. To me, this content-free religion is the same as not believing in anything. Perhaps it gives someone comfort to believe in a vague, impersonal spirit \"out there\", but I dislike using the word \"God\" when referring to the mystery and wonder of the universe itself. Using this word communicates something very different to different people, and implies something that I believe is unwarranted. Richard Dawkins, in one of the point of inquiry interviews, shows that this non-overlapping magisteria is really a farce. He puts it this way...imagine if, at some point, we uncover archeological evidence with some molecular biology that gave you evidence for, say, the virgin birth of Jesus. Do you think that the Christian religions in the world would say, \"Oh no! Non-overlaping magisteria! We can't use science to speak about religious issues!\". Of course not! They'd be screaming it from every church. It's only because there is no evidence for any religious claims that we posit the non-overlap of religion and science. So, in a nut-shell, where religion and science meet, religion either directly agrees with science (in which case it is redundant) or it is wrong. Most of the testable religious claims have been shown to be wrong. Where they don't meet, religion is content-free. If someone decides to find comfort in that, then that is their issue, and science can't really speak to it. I just don't find any value in it. Religious vs Scientific Thinking At its core, however, religious thinking and scientific thinking are nearly opposites. Religious thinking relies on anecdotes, statements from authority, faith without evidence, and mistakes of causation from correlation. Each of these mistakes arise from common human failings of reason and perception, for which the scientific methods have been developed to avoid. To do proper science one does not rely on anecdotes or authority, other than nature as the final arbiter. Evidence is everything, and certain knowledge is never achieved in science (as opposed to religion). So it is no wonder that the more scientific you are, the less appeal religion tends to have. But it also makes you less susceptible to the various guises of pseudoscience and less susceptible to being hoodwinked by cranks and quacks. It is my opinion, then, that the best remedy for religion is simply to teach as much science as possible and let the religion problem work itself out as a result. I don't think that the in-your-face strategies of the new atheists, such as Dawkins, are particularly effective at reducing religion. It has a purpose for rallying the troops, bringing closeted atheists out, so I wouldn't dissuade him from this approach if he feels that that is the primary outcome he wants. I also don't think we should compromise and say there is no conflict between science and religion, which leads to pandering for political reasons with the truth as a casualty. There are fundamental conflicts between many religions and science, and those should be pointed out even if it is uncomfortable for those believers. Science isn't in the business of making people feel comfortable with their beliefs. Thats the role of religion. ![]","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2010/Dec/01/are-science-and-religion-incompatible/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2010/Dec/01/are-science-and-religion-incompatible/"},{"title":"Is -x&#94;2 positive or negative?","text":"So, is -x&#94;2&#94; a positive, negative, or undefined quantity for real-valued x?

After taking quite a while debugging a student problem calculating the normal distribution in Excel, it got me on a quest (and an argument with a colleague) to figure out who else thought this way.

To do otherwise, I believe, is perverse for any application that is doing mathematical applications. I was directed to this page , which outlines many languages. Pretty much just Excel, COBOL, Chipmunk BASIC and a few small scripting languages take the \"unary minus\" approach, which makes \"unary minus\" have precedence over exponentiation.

Of course one could add parentheses, but which is clearer: y=exp(-x\\&#94;2) or y=exp(-(x\\&#94;2)) The second is obviously not ambiguous, but less clear.

Although he demonstrates incredible ignonance of evolution in this clip, he makes some good points...they just aren't the points he thinks he's making. http://cloudfront.mediamatters.org/static/flash/player.swf His main points are the following: \"I don't know why it is unreasonable to say this...I'm not God, so I don't know how God creates...I don't think we came from monkeys...I think that's ridiculous...I haven't seen a half-monkey-half-person yet...did evolution just stop?\" \"They have to force [the idea of evolution] down your throat...when anybody has to force it, it's a problem...you didn't have to force that the world is round...[...]...you don't have to force the truth..you just keep adding evidence and evidence until it becomes self-evident.\" Now, point (1) demonstrates a profound ignorance, willful or otherwise, of the claims of evolution. First, no biologist says we came from monkeys...monkeys and people are just as \"evolved\" as each other, and that they share a common ancestor which would have both features of monkey and human. We have many of these transitional fossils (for a very nice summary see the Transitional Fossil FAQ ). It's really such an elementary error, that he should be thrown off the air just for spreading such ignorance. However, I would like to focus on point (2) which perhaps seems reasonable: that truth should be self evident, and not have to be forced. In a way, one might think that science works this way because everything should be repeatable, and we don't take arguments from authority. However, there is a problem. Although it is true that the fact that the world is round did not have to be forced (in contrast to the bogus propaganda story about Columbus demonstrating it), one does need to actually look at the facts in order to be able to judge...truth can be self evident but it requires one to actually look at the evidence. Take evolution, for example. If you look at the genetic data showing the differences in base-pair counts between animals, this single number mapped out for all animals demonstrates a tree structure ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_descent and http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/section1.html ). Now recall that Darwin did not know anything about genetics, so this is a prediction made 50+ years before the measurements. When you actually look at the evidence for evolution it is absolutely self evident. The problem is several-fold: people refuse to even look at the evidence, choosing instead to willfully remain ignorant thinking they understand it. There is a certain amount of technical information necessary to understand any science, and that takes work. If you don't want to do that work then you'll remain ignorant of it. As an extreme example, quantum mechanics is definitely true, but it neither self evident nor intuitive (and I don't see conservative talking heads railing against it) What's the solution? I'm not sure, but challenging people to learn is a start. ![]","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2010/Nov/22/glenn-beck-on-science/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2010/Nov/22/glenn-beck-on-science/"},{"title":"A walk down memory lane","text":"I just found a page on \"How to Find a Formula for a Set of Numbers\" .

It turns out to be much clearer just using the posterior probabilities. The ψ-measure has a nice intuitive feel for the two-hypothesis case, but becomes convoluted in the multiple hyptheses case. Further, when introducing the application of Bayes theorem for students, I have found it to be clearer to follow the following procedure. We first look at Bayes theorem directly, for N hypotheses: ﻿ We then calculate the numerator only, for every possible hypothesis: ﻿ calculate the sum of all of these values, ￼and then normalize ﻿The Octopus, Again From the Wikipedia article , we have the following data:, which gave us correct=12 out of N=14: ￼ ￼ ￼ The hypotheses that we consider are the following: H = \"Octopus is psychic, and can predict future (sports) events with 90% accuracy\" R = \"Octopus makes random choices\" Y = \"chooses flags with big yellow stripes 90% of the time\" G = \"chooses Germany 90% of the time\" Notice that both models Y and G, give us correct=12 for N=14 (if the \"choosing Germany\" chooses Spain in the Netherlands match, because of the similarity). The prior for the psychic octopus is, again, the very generous p(H) = 1/100. The two other non-random models should be more likely, before any data, so I take them to be p(Y)=p(G)=1/20. The random model, being the most likely, has the rest of the prior probability, p(R)=0.89. Now we calculate the numerators: ﻿￼ Sum the values, ￼ and divide. achieving ￼ Thus, the two flag models went from being rare compared to random to being much more likely than random, and certainly much more likely than psychic. Bayes theorem, properly applied, is a quantitative embodiment of Carl Sagan's famous quote \"extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence\". It is not just that the evidence must be extraordinary (like 999 correct out of 1000), but the evidence must be extraordinary to address all of the, somewhat rare but possible, hypotheses that would come up as much more likely given the initial result. The process of science is to perform experiments to address these alternative hypotheses. !<>","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2010/Sep/25/multiple-model-comparisons-revisited/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2010/Sep/25/multiple-model-comparisons-revisited/"},{"title":"God and Hawking","text":"From the book \"The Grand Design\" By STEPHEN HAWKING And LEONARD MLODINOW .... Newton believed that our strangely habitable solar system did not \"arise out of chaos by the mere laws of nature.\" Instead, he maintained that the order in the universe was \"created by God at first and conserved by him to this Day in the same state and condition.\" .... The press is pitching this book as a denial of God, claiming that Hawking has said that God does not exist. The media never seem to get the nuances of logical thinking, and its consequences. What Hawking and Mlodinow are doing is a modernization of an approach used by Laplace (1749-1827). He worked on many things, including the dynamics of the solar system. When Newton published his laws of dynamics 100 years earlier, he demonstrated that the speeds of the planets could be derived from a simple law of gravity. In this way, Newton connected the Earthly things with the \"Heavenly\" things. However, it was unclear to Newton whether the orbits of the planets would remain constant (as his religious philosophy would state), or if they would be unstable, change, and possibly fly apart given enough time. He posited that one of the roles of God would be to nudge the planets, here and there, to keep their orbits stable. Laplace, performing his calculations more precisely than his predecessors, was able to determine that the orbits would in fact be stable, without any extra tinkering. Napoleon, when presented with the work of Laplace, asked him: \"M. Laplace, they tell me you have written this large book on the system of the universe, and have never even mentioned its Creator.\" Laplace replied, \"I had no need of that hypothesis.\" He did not say that there was no God (although that is what he believed), but that the concept of God was not necessary to explain the things that he was explaining using physics. This included the formation of the solar system from a compressing ball of gas (due to gravity), which then forms the Sun in the center and the planets orbiting around. This is essentially the model still in use today! What Hawking is doing is basically the same thing, but with the origin of the universe. Essentially the current model allows for the possibility of many universes to simultaneously exist and that, like a lottery winner, our universe supports life. It may seem that the universe is \"fine-tuned\" to support human life, and that this would support the notion of an intelligent designer, Hawking is making the argument that a designer is not needed with our current understanding. Like a lottery winner stating that the odds of winning are astronomical, and yet they won, and then reasoning that there was some design in this choice even when there wasn't. As long as you have enough people playing (or enough universes) you'll eventually observe the unlikely, and that unlikely winner will feel singled out. Hawking argues that the lottery winner (the life on Earth), is arguing the same way when it invokes a designer when it doesn't need to. Hawking doesn't state \"God doesn't exist\", because that statement cannot be proven, but he simply states that it is an unnecessary hypothesis for the understanding of the origin of the universe. Of course, *specific* Gods can be disproven. For example, it is clear from many lines of evidence that the Earth is more the 6000 years old and that there never was a global flood. However, you cannot disprove the notion of a God that creates the universe and is then hands-off, like deists commonly believe. It is completely untestable. It is also unnecessary, according to Hawking. This doesn't make it wrong, it is just unnecessary in the same way that we don't need to invoke the divine when understanding how an apple falls from a tree. ![]","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2010/Sep/12/god-and-hawking/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2010/Sep/12/god-and-hawking/"},{"title":"Why pseudoscientists like the chi-square test (and why it shouldn't be taught)","text":"In a prior post I outlined how orthodox statistics can lead to the either-or logical fallacies common in pseudoscience, like astrology and ufo-ology. In this post I focus on the &chi&#94;2&#94; test, it's pathologies, and why it is so useful for a pseudoscientist. The example is lifted from E. T. Jaynes' book \"Probability Theory\" The two problems with &chi&#94;2&#94; are: it violates your strong intuition in some simple cases it can lead to different results with the exact same data, binned in a different way Both of these properties are useful to the pseudoscientist. Intuition and Chi-square: The Three-sided coin In each of this case we will have some data, and two models to compare which try to explain the data. Intuition strongly favors one, and &chi&#94;2&#94; favors the other. One of my favorite problems is the three-sided coin : where the coin can fall heads, tails, or on the edge. Imagine we have two models for a relatively thick coin: Model A: p~heads~=p~tails~=0.499, p~edge~=0.002 Model B: p~heads~=p~tails~=p~edge~=1/3 And we have the following data: N=29: n~heads~=14, n~tails~=14, n~edge~=1 Which model are you more confident in? Model A of course! If we use the &psi-measure for goodness of fit with these two models, as defined in my prior post , then we have (remember: smaller &psi means more confident in the fit, just like smaller &chi&#94;2&#94;): with &psi~B~-&psi~A~=26.85 which makes model A more then 100 times more likely than model B (a &psi difference of 20 would be exactly 100 times). Perfectly reasonable. What about &chi&#94;2&#94;? which makes model B slightly preferable to model A! Amazing! Where is this coming from? Apparently it is coming from the somewhat rare event of an edge-landing. If our data had been instead N=29: n~heads~=15, n~tails~=14, n~edge~=0 then we'd have &psi~A~=0.3 &psi~B~=51.2 and &chi&#94;2&#94;~A~=0.093 &chi&#94;2&#94;~B~=14.55 where now both measures agree that model A is superior. **Why do pseudoscientists love the χ&#94;2&#94; test?** *Answer 1: Because all they need to do is wait for that inevitable, somewhat rare but still possible, data point and χ&#94;2&#94; yields a pathologically high value* The &psi-measure and log-likelihood To understand the other problem with the &chi&#94;2&#94; test we need to understand what the &psi-measure is doing. As above, imagine we have a set of observations O~i~. We define the total number of observed points and the relative frequency of each observation, The maximum likelihood solution for the probabilities of observing O~i~ for each class, i, is just the relative frequency of each observation. This is the \"just-so\" solution, where we estimate the probability of seeing 14 heads in 29 flips as p=14/29. This \"just-so\" solution will have the closest match, and the highest likelihood (by definition). If we have a model which specifies a different set of probabilities for each class, then it's likelihood is simply The &psi measure can be rewritten as So you can think of the &psi-measure as comparing a model with the \"just-so\" solution (which has maximum likelihood). Further, subtracting one value of &psi with another (for different models) performs the log-likelihood ratio between the models. A proper analysis should include prior information, which can be done almost as easily . An almost equivalent problem Imagine that we have a coin with 6 faces, and we are comparing the following models: Model A: p = [0.499/2, 0.499/2, 0.499/2, 0.499/2, 0.002/2,0.002/2] Model B: p = [1/6,1/6,1/6,1/6,1/6,1/6] And we have the following data: N=29: O=[7,7,7,7,0,1] where I have listed the probabilities and the outcomes for each face. Notice that, grouping them together in pairs we retrieve the same as the first example. Thus when comparing the two models, with this equivalent problem, we should get the same value. Because the size of the problem changed, the individual &psi values will be different (larger) because there are more terms in the \"just-so\" solution. However, the difference between the models should be the same. The results are: &psi~A~=11.35 (old value 8.34) &psi~B~=38.2 (old value 35.19) with &psi~B~-&psi~A~=26.85 (old value 26.85...the same!), and &chi&#94;2&#94;~A~=32.6 (old value 15.33) &chi&#94;2&#94;~B~=11.76 (old value 11.66) The &chi&#94;2&#94; for one of the models (Model A) has been inflated quite a lot relative to the other model. This means that, depending on how you bin the data, you can make whichever model that you are looking at more or less significantly different, without changing the data at all. **Why do pseudoscientists love the χ&#94;2&#94; test?** *Answer 2: Because all they need to do is bin their data in different ways to affect the level of significance of their model over the model to which they are comparing* Still taught? So, why is the &chi&#94;2&#94; test still taught? I don't know. It has pathological behavior in simple systems, where somewhat rare events artificially inflate its value, and it can be easily used to prop up an unreasonable model simply by rearranging the data. Why not teach something, like the &psi-measure, which is grounded theoretically in the likelihood principle and does not have such pathological behavior? If you prefer to use the log-likelihood instead, then that would be fine (and equivalent). I think it is about time to purge the &chi&#94;2&#94; test from our textbooks, and replace it with something correct. ![]","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2010/Sep/01/why-pseudoscientists-like-the-chi-square-test-and-why-it-shouldnt-be-taught/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2010/Sep/01/why-pseudoscientists-like-the-chi-square-test-and-why-it-shouldnt-be-taught/"},{"title":"Orthodox Statistics Conducive to Pseudo-Science","text":"I have just realized that the thought process used in orthodox statistics is conducive to pseudo-science. It adds, in my opinion, to the long list of reasons why Bayesian inference is demonstrably superior (also see here ). Let me show with a couple of simple examples. Astrology From this skeptical analysis of some astrology data , listing the numbers of famous rich people in each sign, we see the use of the chi-squared goodness of fit test. The data are: Sign Number of People Aries 95 Taurus 104 Gemini 110 Cancer 80 Leo 84 Virgo 88 Libra 87 Scorpio 79 Sagittarius 84 Capricorn 92 Aquarius 91 Pisces 73 Total 1067 To apply the chi-squared test, we simply compare the above numbers to the expected numbers if completely random, which is 1067 people/12=88.9 people according to: where O are the observed data and E are the expected counts. Once we have the chi-square value and the degrees of freedom (11 in this case), we can look up in tables to get the p-value: Normally, this might be the end of the story, given that there is not even close to a significant value (usual cut-off around p=0.05). Subset of the Data So, if we only take the extreme values, say: Sign Number of People Gemini 110 Pisces 73 Total 183 then we calculate a different chi-squared, with 1 degree of freedom, and get Now this is pretty silly: of course, if you take the extreme values of 12 numbers, and pretend that they came from a 2-category situation, then it'll appear more significant. What about lumping 6 points together, say Capricorn to Gemini (the first part of the year) and the second part. In this case we aren't cherry picking, and the sums should be less significant than the individual data. We then have: Sign Number of People Capricorn-Gemini 565 Cancer-Sagittarius 502 Total 1067 And we expect 533.5 people in each category. Notice that we went from (the most extreme) 20 person difference from expected in about 100 to a 30 person difference in 500...closer to the expected. What do we get from our chi-squared test? The test says that this is significantly different from random, more than the individual data! At least the goodness of fit measure, chi-squared value, went down to denote a closer fit to expected but the reduction in the number of data points changes the test quite a lot. A different measure E.T. Jaynes suggests in his book to use a different measure of goodness of fit, the &psi measure closely related to the log-likelihood Using this measure on the above examples, we get All data: &psi = 28.9 Extreme data: &psi = 39.1 Lumped data: &psi = 8.1 which is completely in agreement with our intuition. The chi-squared test does not match our intuition, and seems to give significance to things that we know shouldn't be.But what about the test with the &psi-measure? How can we tell whether it is a significant difference? One could, in theory, give an arbitrary threshold but that would not be particularly useful, and would not be what a Bayesian would do. What a Bayesian would do is compare values of the goodness-of-fit measure to different models on the same data . It makes no sense, if you have only one model, to reject it by a statistical test...reject it in favor of what? If you have only one model, say Newton's Laws, and you have data that are extremely unlikely given that model, say the odd orbit of Mercury, you don't simply reject Newton's Laws until you have something else to put on the table.The either-or thinking of orthodox statistical tests is very similar to the either-or thinking of the pseudoscientist: either it is random, or it is due to some spiritual, metaphysical, astrological effect. You reject random, and thus you are forced to accept the only alternative put forward. I am not implying that all statisticians are supportive of pseudo-science, and they are often the first to say that you can only reject hypotheses not confirm them. However, since the method of using statistical tests does not stress the searching for alternatives, or better, the necessity for alternatives, it is conducive to these kinds of either-or logical fallacies.An example of a model comparison, from a Bayesian perspective, on a problem suffering from either-or fallacies can be found in the non-psychic octopus post I did earlier . ![]","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2010/Aug/31/orthodox-statistics-conducive-to-pseudo-science/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2010/Aug/31/orthodox-statistics-conducive-to-pseudo-science/"},{"title":"The Non-Psychic Octopus","text":"Introduction I saw in the newspaper an article about a supposedly psychic octopus , which predicts world cup matches by making a choice between two different foods labeled by the team flags. Paul the Octopus has an impressive record of 12 correct out of 14. Or is it impressive? How can we determine whether this performance is evidence for psychic behavior, or something else. A typical statistical analysis might start with the null hypothesis that the octopus was random, so was choosing the teams with probability p=0.5. The likelihood of getting 12 right in 14 is which is fantastically strong against the null! Even if you do the p-value test for the the correct data being more extreme, you get p-val=0.00646. So, we reject the null, and the octopus must be psychic!...(or not) Bayesian Analysis Against Random Let's look at this another way, and perhaps we can gain some insight. It will be convenient to talk about odds, rather then probability, and further to use the log of the odds so that this becomes an arithmetic problem. The odds is defined as the ratio of the probability for a hypothesis, H, and the probability for the inverse, not H. We define the log-odds, or evidence as defined by E. T. Jayes, A few comments before we commence with more calculation. The prior evidence reflects our state of knowledge before we see the data. How likely is it that an octopus is psychic? Most reasonable people would say highly unlikely. Generous odds would be 100:1 against, although personally I'd probably put it at least a million to 1 against. Let's be generous. That gives us a prior evidence of If we had been naive, and set equal odds, then this evidence would be e=0. So we start with evidence e=-20 for a psychic octopus (which is strong evidence against it, because e\\<0), and then we observe the data. If we assume that a psychic octopus is right 90% of the time, and that the only alternative is a random octopus correct 50% of the time, then we have added evidence for each correct answer: Each incorrect answer gives: The evidence gets pushed up from the prior with each correct answer, and down for each wrong answer. Notice how wrong answers are penalized more than right answers. This is because the psychic octopus is pretty good (p=0.9). We get a final (posterior) evidence for 12 correct and 2 wrong: which is about 2:1 odds against the psychic octopus. More to the Story Most pseudoscience gets propagated by people who reason naively. They will say that there are two possibilities, say random and psychic, and they they must both be equally likely before the data. So, when rare data is found, they reject random and claim this is evidence for psychic phenomena. This line of reasoning is incorrect for two reasons: random and psychic are not equally probable a priori - random is much more likely in cases like this there are more possibilities We already saw how point (1) can be handled by proper prior information. Point (2), with multiple hypotheses gets mathematically a bit trickier (there are more terms to carry around) and is thus messier, but conceptually is fairly straightforward. We have two hypotheses so far: H =\"Octopus sees the correct future 90% of the time, and is psychic\" R =\"Octopus chooses randomly.\" Let me introduce two more hypotheses. Y =\"Octopus chooses flags with big yellow stripes 90% of the time\" G =\"Octopus chooses Germany 90% of the time\" How would you choose the prior probabilities for these hypotheses? Personally, as I said before, I'd have p(H) way below p(R) by about a factor of a million, but being generous, let's put it about a factor of 100. What about p(Y) and p(G)? I'd say that these might be comparable to random or, if I knew something about the vision of octopi or how the person feeding the octopus might rig the food in the direction of his favorite team, I might even have p(Y)>p(R) or p(G)>p(R). Certainly p(Y)>p(H) and p(G)>p(H). So what happens with the data? For hypothesis Y, there are N=14 games of which the octopus chooses 12 with bright yellow stripes (there is one where it chose Germany over Ghana and should have chosen Ghana which has a bigger strips, and another with Germany and Spain where Spain should have been chosen). For hypothesis G there are N=14 games and the octopus chooses 12 for Germany (2 teams are chosen that are not Germany, and one match where Germany wasn't a choice and it chose Spain, which has the closest flag). Thus, the data support both of these hypotheses exactly as much as the p=0.9 psychic hypothesis. Therefore, the evidence will push these hypotheses up by as much as the psychic, over the random, and will make the psychic octopus even less likely. So, when you hear fantastic claims supported with a comparison to random, the two things you must do are: Ask yourself what the prior probability of the fantastic claim is. Even if a random explanation is very rare, it will probably still be favored against the fantastic claim. Ask yourself what other possibilities, even if unlikely, could explain the data. Since the fantastic claim is exceedingly unlikely, even somewhat unlikely explanations may be supported by the data more than the original fantastic claim. !<>","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2010/Aug/28/the-non-psychic-octopus/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2010/Aug/28/the-non-psychic-octopus/"},{"title":"A new and content-free model","text":"In his article \"A New and Effective Climate Model\" , Stephen Wilde (guest posting on Anthony Watts' blog) states his dissatisfaction with current climate models, and proposes another \"model\" for climate which he hopes will improve the state of climate modeling in general. In the article he has items like: Solar surface turbulence increases causing an expansion of the Earth's atmosphere. Resistance to outgoing longwave radiation reduces, energy is lost to space faster. The stratosphere cools. Possibly also the number of chemical reactions in the upper atmosphere increases due to the increased solar effects with faster destruction of ozone. The tropopause rises. etc... This list continues for 26 points, not an equation in the mix. So why am I so hooked on equations? Take the first item, and call \"Solar surface turbulence\" T, and the size of the atmosphere, A. Saying T goes up, so A goes up, could be like: ![A2673E80-F8DF-4075-9854-7A956B9CE989.jpg][] which would predict a nice linear response.

You can't build a proper scientific model in words alone. Words are not precise, and there are many different ways to translate them into something that is precise, that can actually make meaningful predictions. A model of just words is not really a model, in the scientific sense. Lord Kelvin said it best: \"In physical science the first essential step in the direction of learning any subject is to find principles of numerical reckoning and practicable methods for measuring some quality connected with it. I often say that when you can measure what you are speaking about, and express it in numbers, you know something about it; but when you cannot measure it, when you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge is of a meagre and unsatisfactory kind; it may be the beginning of knowledge, but you have scarcely in your thoughts advanced to the state of Science, whatever the matter may be.\" !<>","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2010/Jul/11/a-new-and-content-free-model/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2010/Jul/11/a-new-and-content-free-model/"},{"title":"Pascal's Global Warming","text":"I was just alerted to the following video supporting strong action for climate change: [![ssp_temp_capture.png][]] The argument is a little dated, actually, most famously presented in the 1600's well before global warming was a concern. The video uses a rehash of Pascal's wager, replacing personal salvation with policy to deal with climate change. Essentially it states that, if the worst case scenario is very bad, then it is better to deal with that worst case scenario with the possibility of it being a waste of resources, because the alternative (not doing anything and being wrong) is much worse. In Pascal's case, he was arguing for a belief in God. If you believe in God and he doesn't exist, then things aren't that bad (some wasted time and effort). If you don't believe in God and he does exist, then you're in big trouble. The expected value of your reward definitely is maximized by avoiding the worst-case scenario. There are several problems with this argument, as it applies to global warming, many of which apply to the original argument as well. First, one has to look at the probabilities of the events, and not just their existence. It is true that one of the following two statements is correct: there is global warming, and humans are causing it there is not global warming or humans are not causing it If we assign probabilities to the individual events, then the correct policy may not be to address point (1), if it is sufficiently unlikely. Further, even if we assume there is global warming, and humans are causing it, both the amount of the warming and impact of the warming are needed for making policy. So, if the warming is most likely 0.5 deg in 100 years, versus 2 deg in 100 years, then the policy choices should be modified accordingly. Even though there may be a slight chance of a catastrophic warming, we do not need to plan for it if the chance is slight enough. Finally, dumping resources into a non-problem is not just a \"waste of money\", but of lives. The amount of money being discussed here is in the trillions, which can go a long way to fighting problems that we know are here and are a problem (hunger, corruption, extreme poverty, religious extremism, etc...). We have to look at where we need to place resources in the most efficient way to address the many, and serious, problems that we know exist in the world. Now a similar, but more persuasive motivation for climate change regulation is simple: we are dependent on unstable governments for our energy and our energy sources have serious environmental impacts. These facts are currently costing us two unwinnable wars and an oil spill that will take decades to clean up. If we could divert the costs that go into those wars and industries, and put them into non-fossil fuel alternatives (i.e. nuclear fission and fusion), then we have a chance of significantly improving our national security, environment, and future. So, in dealing with a known, significant problem we can solve another (possible) problem (i.e. global warming) as a bonus. ![] [![ssp_temp_capture.png][]]: http://www.break.com/index/tough-to-argue.html","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2010/Jun/25/pascals-global-warming/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2010/Jun/25/pascals-global-warming/"},{"title":"Religion and Scientists","text":"A friend of mine posted this Slashdot brief on Facebook, which also links to this summary . The articles both imply a much stronger religiosity among scientists than is traditionally assumed, quoting the work of Elaine Ecklund. Some key quotes from these two short summaries are: \"Fully half of these top scientists are religious. Only five of the 275 interviewees actively oppose religion\" Even among the third who are atheists, many consider themselves \"spiritual.\" The study reveals that scientists often practice a closeted faith, worrying about how their peers would react to learning about their religious views. The '\"insurmountable hostility\" between science and religion is a caricature, a thought-cliche, perhaps useful as a satire on groupthink, but hardly representative of reality,' writes Ecklund. So, when I read this, I thought \"Wow! Half of these scientists are religious? Spiritual atheists? Closeted faith? That's amazing stuff!\". So, as a scientist myself, I decided to look at the study itself . I confirmed what another blogger stated : essentially the conclusions come from some \"new math\", and vague statements. The study included these results: 34% chose \"I don't believe in God,\" 30% chose \"I do not know if there is a God, and there is no way to find out.\" which equals 64%. So \"fully half\" must mean \"less than 36%\". That's some good arithmetic! Oh, and 8% chose \"I believe in a higher power, but it is not God.\" So I guess religious doesn't imply belief in God, so it goes in the very vague category. If religious includes a belief in God (and I guess in her book she uses \"traditionally religious\"), then \"fully half\" must mean \"less than 28%\". So about 25% of all scientists profess a belief in God, compared to a public of about 80%. That's a pretty stark contrast! I'd wager that there must be something (or somethings) that makes this negative correlation between science and religion. I think it is difficult to argue that there is not some inherent conflict between the two given this contrast. What about the closeted religious scientists? Those shouldn't appear in these anonymous polls, and thus do not affect any of these numbers. If a scientist doesn't want to bring up their religion with their peers, then 1) what does that say about the strength of their beliefs and 2) perhaps the religious aspects of their life are irrelevant to their scientific work. The closeted religious were not mentioned at all in the study, by the way. Spirituality In another monograph , Ecklund discusses her work. In it she states: For many of the natural scientists, in particular, knowledge of the spiritual comes directly from their work. For example, according to one physicist, When I travel to observatories...and when I finally just have enough time to try to think of my place in the world and the universe and its vastness, it's then that I feel the connection to the world more than I do, say, sitting here in my office. And so that for me, that's the closest I can come to a spiritual experience. This excerpt and the many others like it show that, for some scientists, rather than science replacing religion, spirituality may be replacing religion. In this way, it is possible for atheists to be \"spiritual\". To me, I think this is really bad terminology and easily misused. For most people, \"spiritual\" implies some some \"spirit\", or an existence separate from the body. These scientists are making no claim like that, they simply mean a feeling still bound to the biology of our bodies. Unfortunately, by using the term \"spiritual\" it can be used (as here) to enhance the notion that these scientists are religious, or leaning toward religion, which is misleading at best. A religious friend of mine once recently said that she thought I was spiritual. I thought the term was basically meaningless and ill-defined, and still do. Religious Scientists Is it surprising that there are religious scientists? Not at all. Because most of the public is religious, most scientists are raised with some religion. It is also human nature to separate different, conflicting, modes of thinking in different contexts. It is very easy for someone to study superconductivity and not have it interfere or conflict with any of their views of the divine. I've written about religion in other posts , and will only add that I believe that much of religion comes from the skills we have to help our survival: it is better to see a tiger when there isn't one than to not see a tiger when there is one. From there, combine with cultural structures, it is easy to see how religious ideas propagate. The great thing about science is that its methods allow us to transcend these false-positives, and arrive at ways to discern truth from fiction. Because we're human, it doesn't work 100% of the time, but in the long run it has been our most successful human creation. It is no surprise to me that some scientists are religious. It would have been a surprise to me to hear that \"fully half\" are religious, and as it turns out that isn't true. ![]","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2010/Jun/08/religion-and-scientists/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2010/Jun/08/religion-and-scientists/"},{"title":"One last TV post, about Battlestar Galactica","text":"No TV posts for a while after this one...just trying to clear my desk. There are a number of things that bother me about BSG. This list is here for anyone who wants to challenge me on any of this, comment please! It's in the form of loose-fitting notes, written over the course of watching the series. There are spoilers, etc... ​1) Once they find out that Cylons look like us, and they consider a Cylon detector, they seem to hand the entire problem over to Dr. Baltar. There seems to be no consideration about whether he is a Cylon, or in league with the Cylons. What could they do differently? Have the Dr make something that is independently testable, perhaps by Gaita or others. They don't even consider it. ​2) I find it straining in the extreme to believe that there is no straightforward test to tell a Cylon from non-Cylon, given the actions and words of the various people. Cylons: 1) are stronger than people 2) do not tire 3) are able to be uploaded, at least at death 4) have backs that glow under certain conditions 5) have fiber optic interfaces in their arms! points 1 and 2 would almost certainly leave indicators in the muscle cells, as well as brain waves. point 3 on brain waves, and point 4 certainly should be detectable. point 5 should be obvious! At other points, they say that they are basically indistiguishable, which to my mind means that they have organic processes (even if artificially made), and even their brain activity is the same, to the point of being indistinguishable from a person. If that is the case, then it seems weird to talk about them having \"software, not emotions\". It's a looks like a duck, acts like a duck, every possible measurement confirms it's a duck, but it's not a duck? Sorry, that's just too hard to swallow. So you have the problem that, either, they are very different in which case they should be detectable, or they are identical, in which case they are no different than humans. The writers seem to want it both ways. What would my solution be? If these models were designed for the express purpose of infiltratration into the fleet, then there would have been a lot of work to make them undetectable. I would say that the innards would be clearly mechanical/organic, with an organic outside. The inside would broadcast signals to fool scans, like MRI and CAT scans, while the outside would have blood, sweat, etc... to fool observation there. It wouldn't be too hard to imagine that the only way to test for such a thing would entail tests that would be lethal to a person, which might solve some of the writers' problems. Whenever someone said \"they aren't human, they are machines\" I cringed, and wanted to reply: what do you mean by machines? In which ways are they machines and humans aren't? throughout the series, the cylons were humans when convenient, and machines when convenient. I don't think the writers had a consistent vision of what the cylons were, or wanted. ​3) WTF is the cylon plan. They want all humanity destroyed, but then they seem to want humans for procreation and love. They say they want to protect Sharon's baby, and then the next episode (!) they launch an all-out attack on the fleet. They have well hidden spies in the Galactica who could have done damage to the ship, that was going to be a museum anyway, and they were unable to destroy it? How hard would it have been to put one of those Cylon viruses in the computer, dormant, and then when the fleet was assembled have it relay random jump points to all of the fleet, and then send the Galactica into a star? The writers seem to use Cylon attacks, and then Cylon pleasantness or incompleteness, for convenience. It's back to the \"not like us, just like us\" problem above which leads to inconsistent behavior. I think there was no plan, so these inconsistencies keep compounding over time. ​4) In flight of the Phoenix, when they disabled a huge number of cylon raiders, why didn't they capture some of them for use later? Seems like a major tactical failure. ​5) In the 1st season episode when they were looking for Starbuck, who had crashed on a planet with a cylon, Com. Adama said to his son that if it were his son that was lost, that he'd never stop searching. That family was most important. Why, then, in the last episode, is Com. Adama quick to leave his son, knowing that Roslin was only going to be around for a short while, and that both would now be alone. ​6) In Pegasus, why is Baltar's angel surprised at seeing a beat-up number 6? Why does she say \"it's me\", when it really isn't? ​7) if ressurection ships are so important, why not guard them better? why not have 2 ressurection hubs? why not a more distributed system? ​8) how far away really is the Cylon homeworld? ​9) in E16 2nd season, Sacrifice, we have people who claim the fleet are cylon sympathizers and hold hostages. Not 2 episodes before, it was all about cylon sympathizer groups trying to force gallactica to try to get peace with the cylons. Each lasts 1 episode, and no more. so much of this would have been better with a plan, built up over several episodes. ​10) at the beginning of each episode they have a 1-minute \"what has gone before\", and then after the credits they have a 30-second flash of images from the episode. it is as if they don't trust the extended storyline structure, and they feel that a gimic is needed to entise viewers to stay. ​11) in Season 3 episode 8, Bulldog returns in a cylon raider after being gone for 3 years. Doc Cottle does a quick DNA test to match it against his military record, and concludes he's not a cylon. Wow! They couldn't do that in Season 1? It certainly would have made a huge difference. As plot holes go, that one is pretty darn big. ​12) I find it mindboggling that a race that has mastered organic technology cannot a) do a proper quarrantine b) diagnose a simple virus, that Doc Cottle can in a short while ​13) why do the cylons want a new home? why Earth? ​14) the incessant use of flashbacks I think is because there isn't a plan, and this makes it look like there is a consistent backstory ​15) the episodes with the coup, ending in the execution of Zarek and Gaeta...some of the best that the show has had. I'd say, that the best episodes have been: Miniseries Pegasus - Resurrection New Caprica rescue Coup (S4ep 13-14) Notice that these are all the human stories. the cylon stories are not nearly as good. ​16) Episode 15, when Tyrol tells Adama that the ship is slowly breaking up, and there is cylon tech that can help suddenly Adama is anti-cylon tech? he changes his mind later, but still, this is inconsistent with the previous episodes when he was immediately fine upgrading jump drives. why the sudden change of heart? ​17) when the BG makes it's final jump, Adama says: \"whereever we are, that's where we're going to stay\" ...of course, until the rest of the fleet gets there, and we continue with the original plan. Why did Adama say this? ​18) don't build a city at the end? don't use the technology? that seems like an idea from an idealist but not very practical - a sure way to reduce life expectancy in your new home ​19) Adama is a cylon. Kara is the harbinger of death. Baltar and Six will be the mother and father of the human race. prophecies that don't pan out. ​20) from someone else, but exactly what I was thinking: \"\"\" When the season 1 [of Babylon 5] was aired JMS knew why Babylon 4 had appeared and what meant the visions saw there... when the first Shadow cruiser appeared in season 1 he fully knew what it was and who was behind it.. when in season 1 they talked about why Sinclair was so important and what secret he had.. All was shorted out in advance.. he even writed \"scape doors\" in case some actor stepped out of the series.. like happened with Michael O'Haire (Sinclair) left at the end of season 1.. he used a scape door introducing Sheridan..JMS has said he had scape doors for Delen, Garibaldi, etc.. You think BSG writers knew there was going to be 2 earths? Or who the remaining 8 models were going to be? Or even that Tigh and Tyrol were Cylons?... you think they really knew what the Opera house visions really meant? Or what the plan was? \"\"\" ​21) It seems to me that there would be a fool-proof way of killing a cylon without it able to download: instantly drop it in the engine. unless the download is able to be done in nanoseconds, there wouldn't be anything left to download from. !<>","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2010/Jun/08/one-last-tv-post-about-battlestar-galactica/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2010/Jun/08/one-last-tv-post-about-battlestar-galactica/"},{"title":"Battlestar Galactica, Lost, and Babylon 5: To Plan or not to Plan","text":"I'll get back to more academic things shortly, but I wanted to get this one off my chest. I just finished watching the entire series of Battlestar Galactica, which I did in little bits over the course of a year or so (I don't watch much TV, so I catch it when I exercise, and an occasional lunch time). I've always liked science fiction, was a big Trek fan, and followed Star Trek Next Generation from the beginning through all 7 years. I am a huge fan of Babylon 5, which I still believe to be the best Sci Fi ever to be on television ( see full episodes here ). Battlestar Galactica could have been that, but failed in one very particular way which I'll get to. Other people said that I'd like Lost, but I refused to watch it until it was done, so I could be told whether it failed as well, which I've been told it did in the same way as Battlestar Galactica (BG). How did it fail? BG failed, not because of budget (which was probably 10 times that of Babylon 5 (B5)), or acting, cast changes, director problems, or writing (which is some of the best I've ever seen), but because they didn't have a plan . BG and Lost claimed they had a plan, but didn't. On the other hand, the creator of B5 shorted out all of the episodes for 5 years, so he knew where things were going from day 1. B5 is the only show that I know of that has done that, and it is (in my opinion) the only way to do long-running shows like these. Why does this make such a difference? Inconsistencies. When you have a plan, you don't have nearly as many inconsistencies. You're not trying to hack together a concluding episode, trying to make all of the lose ends tie together in some haphazard way, because you knew how they tied together at the beginning. Star Trek Next Generation solved this problem, mostly, by not having any long-running plot lines. Each episode ends with the characters in exactly the same condition as they started. BG had some good ideas, but its resolution seemed like a hack. Foreshadowing. When you have a plan, you can have foreshadowing. Not just vague, unexplained claims, but real references to future events. In the first episode of B5, a character refers to a prophetic dream they have about their death 20 years from then. At the time the viewer thinks they understand the dream, or think that it is a toss-off comment, but late 3rd season we see some of the details, and late 5th (and last) season we see the lead-up to those events. The flashback method is the poor-man's (or poor planners) way of doing this, basically saying \"we need these events to have happened in the past, to make sense of what we want to show now, but we didn't think of it before so we'll show it now\". BG used this a lot. Larger Story Arc. Even at its weakest points, B5 benefited from its plan. A weak single episode was lifted up if it contributed to the larger story arc. In this way, weak episodes were improved because there was a plan, and the entire series seemed more consistent. Rewatchability. From a marketing point of view, this seems to me to be a no-brainer, although it is almost never done. Once B5 finished, I wanted to go back and watch it again to pick up on all of those things that were planned, but I missed. How much foreshadowing did I miss? How many little details in the background were there that became important, but I didn't realize? How many decisions of the characters contributed to their final roles? How many seemingly throw-away lines were really important? Now that I've finished watching BG, I don't have any urge to watch it ever again. There's nothing new to see. Finding out in season 3 that Tigh is a Cylon doesn't modify your perspective on any of his actions in season 1. None of the fates of the characters can be seen in the early parts of the series. The so-called prophecies are each stated and resolved in a couple episodes, or so vague as to be meaningless. I've heard that Lost suffers from this same problem: no plan leads to inconsistent storylines, convenient flashbacks, and an unsatisfying conclusion with loose ends. Now, B5 wasn't perfect. It could have used more money, better actors, better dialog. It's writing can be corny at times, and there was a studio snafu that condensed some of the plot in Season 4, and made Season 5 a bit thinner than one would like. However, the universe is entirely original, and the 5-year plan was just amazing and makes the series hold up well over time. I now won't watch much of anything without a plan...it's just not worth the ride. ![]","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2010/Jun/08/battlestar-galactica-lost-and-babylon-5-to-plan-or-not-to-plan/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2010/Jun/08/battlestar-galactica-lost-and-babylon-5-to-plan-or-not-to-plan/"},{"title":"Lord of the Rings","text":"I have a backlog of blog posts that I wanted to get caught up on.

I am skeptical of conclusions based entirely on models, and I am really skeptical of anything where I perceive less-than-open information exchange combined with vested interests and a lot of money. Given all of that, I feel free to rip apart anyone's argument regardless of which side they happen to be on. :) That's how science works! So I was pointed to an article called \"The Hidden Flaw in Greenhouse Theory\" which has such flawed logic itself that I am surprised someone wrote it. Introduction To summarize the article, I quote the last paragraph: > An idea has been drummed into our heads for decades: that roughly 1% > of the atmosphere's content is responsible for shifting the earth's > surface temperature from inimical to benign. This conjecture has > mistakenly focused on specifically light-absorbing gases, however, > ignoring heat-absorbing gases altogether. Any heated atmospheric gas > radiates infrared energy back toward the earth, meaning that the > dreadful power we've attributed to light-absorbing molecules up to now > has been wildly exaggerated and must be radically adjusted -- indeed, > pared down perhaps a hundred times. Because all gases radiate the heat > they acquire, trace-gas heating theory is an untenable concept, a > long-held illusion we'd be wise to abandon. > How does he come to such a grand conclusion? He starts with a quote of a NASA elementary school guide, which has: Question: Do all gases absorb heat? • Answer: No. Only some gases have the unique property of being able to absorb heat. Then he (correctly) criticizes this guide saying > So how does NASA go wrong? By consistently confusing light and heat, > as you see in the illustration below, where infrared light is depicted > as heat. > Clearly NASA should have said that greenhouse gases absorb infrared light, or radiation. Then the author continues with this: > Why does NASA go wrong? Because it has a flimsy yet lucrative theory > to foist on the taxpaying public, that's why. As the space agency > explains in the Main Lesson Concept, the core idea of greenhouse > theory is that downward radiation from greenhouse gases raises the > earth's surface temperature higher than solar heating can. > This is amazing. Regardless of ones stance on global warming, the greenhouse effect (badly named) is a well known, well established consequence of the basic laws of thermodynamics. Without it, Earth would be far less habitable! Conduction, Convection, Radiation, Oh My! He continues: > To make this idea seem plausible, therefore, it's crucial to fix > people's attention on the 1% of the atmosphere that can be heated by > radiant transfer instead of the 99% and more that is heated by direct > contact with the earth's surface and then by convection. > As a nitpick, it would actually be more like 5 percent or so, because water vapor is the most abundant greenhouse gas. Even so, his argument is fallacious, that a trace gas cannot cause significant warming. Let's take another example of a trace gas that increases atmospheric warming: ozone. In the stratosphere, at the \"ozone layer\", the concentration of ozone is about 2 to 8 parts per million. That is 0.0002%! Despite this trace amount, we get significant warming of the stratosphere as shown here . His reasoning on this issue is > Consider too that since most air molecules are infrared-transparent, > they can't be heated by the infrared that CO2 and water vapor emit. > This means that downward radiation from \"greenhouse gases\" can only > explain how the earth's surface might get warmer, not the rest of the > atmosphere. > No one is suggesting that the non-greenhouse gases are being heated by the re-radiation of the greenhouse gasses. They are heated by the collisions with greenhouse gasses, thus raising the overall atmospheric temperature. This feedback loop continues until the new balance, with the surface, is established. It's strictly conservation of energy. Some is radiated, some is lost in collisions, and the gasses in the atmosphere as well as the surface adjust until an equilibrium temperature is reached. A simple process, really. At the crux of his argument is this: For meteorologists acknowledge that our atmosphere is principally heated by surface contact and convective circulation. This is just wrong. What physicist do is follow the money, or the energy in this case. A very simple balance can be shown, quantified, and verified by numerous types of measurements. A very simple picture of it is here. ![5ADD81CC-8005-4BA1-915D-5294F80A36C5.jpg][] (From http://oceanworld.tamu.edu/resources/oceanography-book/radiationbalance.htm , which cites Houghton et al., (1996: 58), which using data from Kiehl and Trenberth (1996).) As a fraction of the 342 units of solar energy coming in, about 168 is absorbed directly but about 324 is absorbed from the atmospheric radiation! The fraction of conduction and convection comes only to about 30%. It is true that the atmosphere gets some energy from conduction, but not most of its energy. Scientific-sounding Junk It is a real challenge for people without science background to sift through things like this. It sounds like science, but it is incredibly wrong. One way to help tell the difference is to observe how the author responds to criticism. Concerning the errors, do they offer an errata or do they ignore them, or worse, inject ad-hominem attacks on the critic? Saying that NASA \"has a flimsy yet lucrative theory to foist on the taxpaying public\" is playing into people's distrust of government, and trying to use that to bolster an argument, without actually strengthening the argument itself. It is implying motive without substantiation. I could do that too by suggesting that the author is starting with an anti-global warming position, and wants to prop it up with whatever emotional verbiage he can get away with to hide spurious arguments. Instead, I simply show how elementary and spurious his arguments are, and predict that he will not submit any corrections. I can point out the ad-hominem attacks on NASA as unbecoming of a scientific argument, and is useful only in a propaganda piece. Another way that someone might tell if the argument is sound, is what sorts of errors are being raised. If the errors are of a technical nature, like the benefits of particular statistical tests, then it can be hard for a non-expert to tell. However, if the arguments have basic errors that can be confirmed in encyclopedias then it is much easier to tell. If the arguments include non-scientific, emotional, exaggerated language then it is much easier to tell that it is a propaganda piece and not a scientific piece. Are there other ways that non-experts in a field can decide the merits of arguments? Perhaps someone will comment and add some more, and perhaps I'll think of some more. Mostly, being able to skeptically think like a scientist, regardless of your personal belief in something, is the most important skill to use in cases like this. I think it is an important thing to consider, in order to better win over the public to science. ![]","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2010/Feb/26/the-not-so-hidden-flaw-in-this-climate-argument/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2010/Feb/26/the-not-so-hidden-flaw-in-this-climate-argument/"},{"title":"A bit of must-read economics","text":"In the face of Obama's new healthcare initiative, which includes provisions to cap the increases in insurance costs , you can [read here a nice description of the problems of fixing maximum prices] .

This term is easily calculated as ![97AB81E4-08B6-4C53-8129-5432094EE211.jpg][] which I used in the analysis. Someone raised the question, \"What would happen if (as we know) people don't tend to name two children the same (unless you're George Foreman)?\" At first, this seems exactly like a coin flip problem: what is the probability of, in two coin flips, flipping heads on the first flip or flipping heads on the second but not both? It turns out that this is a different problem, and the result is surprising (at least to me). We have to be very careful what information we condition on, knowing that the English language is a little more fluid than we like when dealing with such problems. In the coin flip case we define ![5AA78167-FEF6-4DBE-BA47-8CE19D8CC0F4.jpg][] : and it follows, given the probability of flipping heads is h , ![B305BC0D-48EB-4BCB-929F-0C7BE8F53B21.jpg][] which is just the standard result, subtracting off the possibility of having both heads. For h=0.5, this yields the standard result of P(h) = 0.5. As h gets close to 1, the probability of a heads goes way up, and thus the probability of both being heads goes way up . As a result, the probability of just having 1 heads goes to zero. The situation with names is nearly the opposite: as the frequency of a name increases, the name is much more common. This makes it more and more likely that you will have someone with that name. The difference is in the conditioning information: ![EBA08560-A8CA-4B0A-94FB-3279139A9848.jpg][] The analysis then goes: ![B10C9CE9-BECE-42D9-A17E-5214D5134406.jpg][] which is exactly the same result as the case where one can name both of the children Florida!

It's a nice time, seeing flowers in the middle of February, snacking on the pretzel and dip samples, and seeing all of the house and garden related vendors. It's tainted, however, by a particular vendor selling magnetic therapy items, such as bracelets, braces, and necklaces. The company is called Palmer's Global Magnetic Therapy, and I am bothered even writing their name here, giving them more exposure. The Science Their pamphlet has more science errors per square inch than any text I have ever read. For example, ![screen-capture.png][] Given that light is electromagnetic radiation, and I believe that light has been around a bit longer than people (even by creationist standards!), this definition is flat-out wrong. Saying that low-levels are \"fought off\" by the body, yet \"higher levels are proving to cause gradual break down in health\" is at best misleading: high levels of radiation, such as high-energy x-rays, break down organic molecules, but you aren't generally exposed to this in such high dosages. Either way, it is irrelevant to magnetic therapy where the magnets used are of such low intensity that no significant effect would be expected anyway. On the medical side, this pamphlet is just as bad. ![screen-capture-1.png][] Let's take the last point first: \"cancer cannot exist in a strong magnetic field\". This is a true statement. What they left out is that, at that strength of magnetic field, non-cancerous cells also can't survive. It'd be like the statement: \"cancer cells cannot exist is molten lava\", which would be true...but useless and misleading. The previous points, about the medical effectiveness of magnets, is also not correct. Although it seems to be challenging to have a blinded study of magnetic therapy, because people can easily test to see if the magnetics attract keys or other household items, careful studies have not found any effect of magnetic therapy. You can see some of them here , here , a nice wikipedia summary , and [another very good summary of some other arguments against magnetic therapy] . I could go on and on with this, but I want to highlight a few things directly related to pseudo-scientific thinking. The following statement is indicative of the sort of thing, not limited just to magnetic therapy but to all forms of sham-medical treatments and much of pseudo-science as well. ![screen-capture-2.png][] Rephrased, a bit bluntly, this reads: \"if you do our treatment for your ailment, and your ailment improves, then that is proof of the effectiveness of our treatment. if it doesn't improve, then you did something wrong, and it says nothing about our treatment\". It's like the psychics who complain that the room isn't right, or their abilities are hampered by skeptical treatment, but otherwise they are perfect. Heads, I win. Tails, you lose. James Randi has pointed this out many times, with the people trying for his million dollar challenge . It is the type of thinking that protects you from ever being wrong, and thus places your statements outside of the realm of science. Unfortunately, it also generally means you're wrong, and are simply trying to avoid critique to keep the comfort of your misguided ideas. Avoiding the FDA In order to avoid the FDA, they have to put a disclaimer in, which reads: ![screen-capture-4.png][] However, does this disclaimer allow them to state the things above (about cancer), or these claims: ![screen-capture-3.png][] or these? ![screen-capture-5.png][] or these? ![screen-capture-6.png][] I'm no legal expert, but it seems to me that this is filled with medical claims, and simply stating \"we are not making medical claims\" should not be enough. What to do? I see these people every year, and every year I wonder what should I do. What is my moral obligation, what are my legal limits, what are my options? Sometimes I ignore them, but always feel bad afterward. I have a gut feeling that I have a responsibility to help save as many people from this scam as I can, especially since it is right in my backyard. I see people at the booth, and it drives me nuts. I try to educate my students, and anyone around me who will listen, but that doesn't feel like enough. One suggestion that someone had was to set up a booth of my own, an anti-magenetic therapy booth. I'm not sure if this would either be allowed, or might be taken as libelous or something else that involves lawyers. There is the distinct possibility that it would simply make me look like a jerk, and work against the message that I would want to achieve. A few years ago, I did approach them, and as gently as I could asked if they ever thought to consult a physicist concerning some of the claims in the pamphlet. It's a husband and wife team, and the wife was reasonably conversational. The husband was immediately aggressive and hostile. He questioned the need for such a thing, and when I pointed out a couple of straight-forward errors (not even the efficacy errors) he did not take it well. He even admitted to me, to my amazement, that he didn't care whether the claims were correct! Another year I gave them a folder I'd prepared about magnetism, and some of the magnetic therapy studies. I even created an email address (brianthephysicist) for any questions they had...I never heard from them. This year I submitted their website to the FDA website on \"Reporting Unlawful Sales of Medical Products on the Internet\" . I have to admit that that felt good, but I doubt that in reality it will affect very much, if anything at all. So I am still left with the questions: what should I do with this case? What is my moral obligation, what are my legal limits, what are my options? Unfortunately, I don't really know. ![]","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2010/Feb/21/magnetic-therapy-getting-under-my-skin/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2010/Feb/21/magnetic-therapy-getting-under-my-skin/"},{"title":"Economics","text":"In a post about Ten Principles of Economics , Harvard Professor Greg Mankiw writes a little acrostic device about economics. In addition to things like \" E verything has a cost. There is no free lunch. There is always a trade-off.\" for the \"E\" in economics, I found this one caught my eye: \" O ne More. Rational people make decisions on the basis of the cost of one more unit (of consumption, of investment, of labor hour, etc.).\" My first thought was, is this really true? Perhaps a real economist will correct me, but I disagree with this statement. From my limited economics knowledge, a rational person makes a decision to maximize the net benefit resulting from that decision, given the information that the person has. This is maximizing the benefits minus the costs, or ![0F362209-06FA-46F3-9B58-0EE7A9BD0F98.jpg][] Where B(q) is the benefit and C(q) is the cost, and q is a label for the different possible decisions, usually representing the quantity of a particular good that is purchased. To find the maximum (or minimum) we take the derivative and set it to zero: ![962BDC01-F9A1-4FF8-A7FD-694A1D810921.jpg][] The decision on the \"basis of the cost of one more unit\" is referring to dC(q)/dq , or the marginal cost. When the marginal cost equals the marginal benefit, then we are at an optimum (which could be a minimum of the net benefit!). What I disagree with is that I don't think that people make a decision based on dC(q)/dq , but rather that they make decisions on B(q)-C(q) . You might say, \"But, hey, those are the same thing!\". The distinction I think is found in the correspondence between a model and the real-world. Quantities like the cost of a good, or the benefit of the good, are directly observable and measurable. The marginals, or derivatives, of those same quantities are not directly observable but are inferred from the values of the non-marginal quantities at various values of q . To make an analogy with physics, think of position and speed. Speed is change of position with time, or the \"marginal position\" if you will. You measure speed by taking different positions and different times of some object, and calculating speed. You don't measure speed directly. The analogy breaks a bit, because there are ways of inferring speed without position, using the doppler effect , which is how we can measure the speeds of very distant objects without knowing their position. The question I have is, \"Is there a similar way to directly measure the marginal cost, without first knowing the cost of the good?\" I don't think that this is possible. First, I think it quite likely that there are cases where B(q)-C(q) is not differentiable, so it makes no sense to think of \"just one more\" but you can still maximize the quantity. The differentiation is a simplification, a model. Second, the equality of dC(q)/dq to dB(q)/dq occurs at both a minimum and a maximum, and needs to be confirmed if it is truly a maximum by going back to the values of B(q) and C(q) . Thus knowledge of \"one more\" is incomplete. Finally, as stated above, I don't think that the marginals are directly observable, whereas the direct quantities are. Hopefully an economist will comment and correct, or confirm, what I am saying! ![]","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2010/Jan/31/economics/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2010/Jan/31/economics/"},{"title":"Faith and Science","text":"I was listening to a very nice talk by Ken Miller , from Brown University. He's the Biology professor who testified in the Dover Evolution Trial . The reason that he is involved in cases involving the attack on evolution from the religious right is several-fold, including his knowledge of evolution (even though that is not his main area of expertise) and his widely-used textbook (which was the target of the warning labels in Georgia). Ken Miller keeps a page on evolution and his own webpage with many links, presentation slides, and talk videos. I think the most important reason for his involvement is that he is a self-acknowledged Christian (a Catholic, to be specific). Rather than inviting an expert like Richard Dawkins (who is decidedly anti-religious) to testify, it is much better to invite someone who claims there is no conflict between religion and science. Thus the case can't be cast as a battle between science and religion, and can be seen only as what is appropriate science education. So in his talk, Ken Miller makes the point that science should inform faith and faith should inform science. He cites Paul Davies, a physicist who has an interest in theism, and whose article \"Taking Science on Faith\" takes the position that science itself is a faith-based activity. Ken Miller points out, and you can confirm in Paul Davies' article, that there are two tenets in science that are taken on faith: the universe is ultimately knowable and understandable knowledge is better than ignorance At first I thought that one perhaps should call these axioms, more like mathematics, and not \"faith\" because something in me felt that these two ideas were different somehow than the belief in God. Then, I realized, that they are different fundamentally and faith, or even axioms, is entirely wrong. The first idea, that the universe is knowable, needs to be a bit more specific: what does it mean to be knowable? Prior to 1900, it was believed that the pieces of a physical model, such as the force of gravity, or the electric and magnetic fields of Maxwell were \"real\": there was one-to-one correspondence between the model components and things in the real world. Thus, it was believed, that knowing the model you would know nature. After 1900, with the advent of quantum mechanics, physical models were evaluated based on their predictive value: those models that predicted well were good models. It was not believed that there was necessarily a correspondence between the model components and the real components in nature. Aspects of the model, such as the wave function, were not believed to be real but simply useful in making predictions. To know the world is to be able to predict what would happen. Let's say we replace \"understandable\" with \"predictable\", a replacement which I think makes practical sense (how else would you determine that you understand something?), and is directly in line with modern physical thinking. Doing this, then tenet (1) ceases to be an axiom, or something we take on faith, but is observable. If the universe is unpredictable, then all attempts at making prediction will fail. This is not what we observe at all. Surely there are still things that are unpredictable, such as the simultaneous value of the position and momentum of the electron, or the positions of every molecule of air in this room, but even there we can make specific predictions about average quantities or the values of other variables of interest. Practically, the universe has demonstrated itself to be understandable, on the whole. This is not a matter of faith! The second tenet (2) I would wager is too vague. What does \"better\" mean? Better for whom, or for what? Psychologically, one might argue something akin to \"ignorance is bliss\", and there might be something to that. If we define, however, \"better\" to be higher standard of living (longer, healthier, more free life) then knowledge can be argued to have a demonstrable benefit over ignorance. The results of science has doubled the life expectancy in the past 100 years, and has allowed us to live more free and healthy lives. The thousands of years of faith before that cannot say as much. As Carl Sagan says, science delivers the goods. Is there any convincing argument that ignorance is better, or that we really can't decide which is better? Is there a preferable definition of \"better\"? ![]","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2010/Jan/31/faith-and-science/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2010/Jan/31/faith-and-science/"},{"title":"A couple of interesting videos","text":"With the advent of computer technology, it can be challenging to distinguish fact from fiction.

After re-listening to it, I find my position is a bit more nuanced. I'd still like to look more closely at the experiments he cites to see if there is anything there that addresses my concerns, like the difference between believing in an external essence of an object versus experiencing the memories that an object elicits. In this post I want to address something that both Bruce and Tom dance around during the interview: the positive aspects of superstition. Tom tries to tie Bruce down concerning the bad aspects of superstition, citing witch burning and crusades. Bruce refuses to acknowledge superstition as a bad thing, and simply states that superstitious thinking, combined with economic factors and political motivation, can lead to such bad consequences. He further states that intuitive thinking is essential for science. Science doesn't just creep forward in small steps, but is also driven by the intuitive leaps of the scientists. Our ability to see patterns leads us to the patterns we have accumulated in scientific knowledge, and this ability is a consequence of natural selection . Bruce Hood further talks about unconscious reasoning, such as the dream of Friedrich Kekulé and the structure of benzene , and solving problems while you sleep or are taking a break. I myself have solved some problems this way, and many of the interesting physics problems that I have used in my teaching have come, seemingly randomly, while doing mundane things like raking leaves or taking a shower. Although he states that he is an atheist, and is a scientist, I don't think he goes far enough in supporting science. In this way, his omission leads to the sense that he is a bit too supportive of the poor thinking associated with superstition. He points out that much of it is not factually correct, but I think he misses a big point in his exposition (one that I am quite confident he'd agree with). Carl Sagan put it this way: > At the heart of science is an essential balance between two seemingly > contradictory attitudes—an openness to new ideas, no matter how > bizarre or counterintuitive they may be, and the most ruthless > skeptical scrutiny of all ideas, old and new. This is how deep truths > are winnowed from deep nonsense. > It is this sentiment that is missing from the interview, and would have cleared up many of the questions. Yes, we are all programmed (via natural selection) to be superstitious, to see patterns that may or may not really exist, to attribute properties to objects that may or may not be real. Science works by starting with that, and skeptically testing every pattern to see if it is real. It is only the ones that can stand up to skeptical scrutiny that we can trust. Thus, Bruce's \"super-sense\" is the starting point, the intuition which leads to \"crazy\" ideas, out-of-the-box solutions. Skepticism, open information, and honesty reduce the many possible ideas down to the ones that are true. In some way, this is like the process of natural selection: the \"random\" element in evolution (mutation, crossover, etc...) leads to variation, and natural selection works on that variation to produce the (far fewer) solutions that are optimal for the various ecological niches. In science, intuition gives us the variation, and skepticism and careful observation work on that variation to produce the (far fewer) solutions that are true. Finally, in the fine words of Carl Sagan from his book \"A Demon Haunted World\" (the best science book for the public I have ever read!): A physicist has an idea. The more he thinks it through, the more sense it seems to make. He consults the scientific literature. The more he reads, the more promising the idea becomes. Thus prepared, he goes to the laboratory and devises an experiment to test it. The experiment is painstaking. Many possibilities are checked. The accuracy of the measurement is refined, the error bars reduced. He lets the chips fall where they may. He is devoted only to what the experiment teaches. At the end of all this work, through careful experimentation, the idea is found to be worthless. So the physicist discards it, frees his mind from the clutter of error, and moves on to something else. ![]","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2010/Jan/12/creativity-science-and-the-brain/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2010/Jan/12/creativity-science-and-the-brain/"},{"title":"Believing the unbelieveable","text":"Have a listen to this excellent interview of neuroscientist Bruce Hood .

They do two things: a miniature version and full-scale recreation. In their miniature version they scale down the bus by a factor of 12, very carefully building the model bus as closely as possible. Then they scale down the bridge by the same factor. They then point out that they can't scale down gravity without going to the moon. Technically, that would scale gravity by 1/6, not the required 1/12. You wouldn't even have to go nearly as far as the Moon to achieve this. Since force gravity decreases as the square of the distance away from the Earth (starting at 4000mi, the radius of the Earth), you would only have to go up this high: compared to the 240,000 mi, that's a real bargain! But this is about 10,000 mi above the Earth, whereas the Hubble is less than 600 mi above the Earth, just to give some perspective. So, without leaving the Earth, the NASA experts say that one can compensate by going faster. Mythbusters scrawls the analysis on the side of the buss and says \"basically, what these hieroglyphics mean is to compensate for the physical impossibility of scaling gravity, the speed of our 1/12 scale bus has to be just over 20 miles per hour\". What bothers me most about this is not that they don't really go through the analysis, but that they refer to basic math as hieroglyphics and they give no sense for why going a bit faster would compensate for gravity. I am going to include the full analysis here, but below I will also give a simpler explanation that they could have used, which only includes a small amount of math that would have easily fit on the side of the bus. Analysis Their analysis is equivalent to the following: the components of the speed off of a ramped angle are and the x and y positions versus time are given by the standard motion equations Here is the critical step. We solve for time, t , and get rid of it in the second equation. This way we have the shape of the entire trajectory in space, without any dependance on time. or: Now, what happens to this equation when we scale the distances down by a certain amount? which is almost the same, except for one factor of gamma over the v &#94;2&#94; term. Thus, if we replace the speed with the trajectory of the new version is identical to the old version. Now, remember, that this doesn't include time: the scaled version, going a faster, will reach the destination sooner. A Clearer Way I certainly wouldn't expect the television audience to follow that analysis, although I wouldn't mind them showing it anyway (but more explicitly). It's the sort of thing where many would ignore it, but the ones who could understand it would get more out of the show. So let's see if we can put it a bit more clearly. I'd start, first, by scaling down the sizes by a factor of 16 not 12. That way I can take the square root more easily. Then there'd be two more facts about gravity that I would mention gravity doesn't affect motion horizontally vertically, if I throw something up at three times the speed, it will go up nine times the height (the square of the speed increase) Scaling down just the size, but not the speed, by a factor of 16 would decrease the time by the same factor of 16. If we scale the speed down by a factor of 4, then three things happen: the height of the trajectory reduces by 16 (item 2 above), the time of flight reduces by a factor of 4, and thus the horizontal distance covered (speed times time) is reduced by a factor of 4x4=16. Notice that in doing so, the object trajectory is scaled in both the vertical and horizontal directions by 16, which is the goal of the scaling. I think that this is clearer than the way presented by Mythbusters, and should have been covered in this way, or some similar way. It could have have been a good teaching moment! !<>","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2010/Jan/07/a-teachable-moment-lost/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2010/Jan/07/a-teachable-moment-lost/"},{"title":"There once was a girl named Florida (a.k.a Evil problems in probability)","text":"In a [previous post][] I described the Monty Hall problem, and noted that a simulation can often lead to clarity of thinking on tough probability problems. I take another example here, in two steps, and throw analysis and simulation at it and possibly a bit of intuition. I was first introduced to this problem from Leonard Mlodinow's \"The Drunkard's Walk: How Randomness Rules Our Lives\" and immediately \"fell for the trap\". The problem exists in two parts, the first (easy) part followed by the second (hard) part. The easy part is as follows: Say you know a family has two children, and further that at least one of them is a girl. What is the probability that they have two girls? An easy way to do this is to list out the possibilities: Boy-Girl Girl-Boy Girl-Girl so you end up with 1 chance out of 3, or p=0.33. The hard part is the following: > Say you know a family has two children, and further that at least one > of them is a girl named Florida. What is the probability that they > have two girls? > At first I didn't think it would make any difference. How could knowing the name of the child change the chances for two girls? So I didn't believe the author (at first) that the chances were even, p=0.5, for the family to have two girls. Again we can list off the possibilities: Boy-Girl (Florida) Girl (Florida)-Boy Girl (Not Florida)-Girl (Florida) Girl (Florida)-Girl (Not Florida) Girl (Florida)-Girl (Florida) Since the last point is very rare (two girls named the same rare name?) we can ignore it, and we can also see that there are now two Girl-Girl possibilities with one named Florida, rather than just one, so it essentially gets two votes. Thus, we get p=0.5. Now, when I see something like this I worry. Yes, it's intuitive (once you see it) but I've seen slight-of-hand counting of the possibilities before. I don't trust it unless I can do two things: write a simulation which reproduces it show that a formal analysis works for the problem As for the simulation (I post the code below) I get: Probability for a girl to be named Florida: 0.01Total number of families with two children: 1000000999862 girls (0.499931 of children)249745 both girls (0.249745)750117 families with girls (0.750117)249745 both girls (0.332941) given families with girls10084 families with a girls named florida4997 both girls (0.495537) given families with girl named florida The formal analysis gets interesting, because I want to understand how the frequency, *f*, of the name affects the probability of having two girls. If it is a rare name (*f* \\~ 0) then I should get p=0.5. For a common name (*f* \\~ 1) then I should get p=1/3. Not that with *f*=1 then the word \"name\" is a little odd because all girls have it, so one might think of it as a label (like \"has a nose\"). First some notation: ![8C429ED4-C97A-42F4-B427-4FCE878E249D.jpg][] Applying Bayes theorem to the easy problem, we get: ![EA082732-B226-4D70-B9B0-5B88943EA579.jpg][] The hard problem is set up like: ![D99FFC2B-0B77-4F3A-8B6D-C8640CA94738.jpg][] It is clear that *p({L1g}|2g)=1* whereas *p({L1g},F|2g)=1* is not: given that we have 2 girls, we definitely have at least one girl, but we need not have at least one girl named Florida. Breaking the second term up we get ![5B40FEDB-02C8-4803-93E3-E05B4D8E42A5.jpg][] Now we have ![BB5BFD58-9E43-44C4-B3F1-B075AC680225.jpg][] It is easy to check that it has the right limits: ![A4B10902-407C-4BDE-9AC4-A565F17E0FB6.jpg][] I'm not sure if there is a better way to address this problem, but the analysis and simulation agree, and further we have a very simple form for how the probability depends on the frequency of the known label (e.g. Florida).

In one of the statements, I had claimed that there were more polar bears now than there were 20-30 years ago. In another statement, another professor claimed that the polar bears were dying off due to arctic ice retreat due to global warming. This is actually a nice case of \"follow the data\", where the problem is defined in a relatively concrete way. Another example of this is the question \"is it warmer now than 1000 years ago?\". On the second question, www.realclimate.org would say \"yes, it is warmer than 1000 years ago\" and cite the proxy data, etc... w ww.climateaudit.org would say (I believe) \"maybe, maybe not\" and cite the issues with the analysis of the proxy data. Now, back to the polar bears. From the polarbearsinternational it is confirmed that the population of polar bears from the 1960's was very low, in the few thousands, and in the early 2000s was up to between 22000-25000. These are also reflected in the usgs site on polar bears where you can actually get some of the data. If you go to the polar bear specialist group which advises for the IPCC, you can find a table of the status of the polar bear in various regions .

Anyway, there is a document here which has an explanation of the projections, and possibly some data, although I haven't read the 200 pages of the document to see if it is buried in the text (there is no figure with the data...just model predictions). I'd love to find a straightforward presentation of the estimates of the current numbers of polar bears, complete with error-bars to denote uncertainty. It seems reasonable that with the decline of the arctic ice that the polar bear populations can be affected, some more than others, but the role of hunting (the regulation of which caused the surge in the bear numbers from the 1970s) still plays a role can is difficult to disentangle...I've seen unsubstantiated claims that the areas with the decrease are primarily hunting areas. I haven't confirmed this, but this could also be the fact that ice retreat will be more substantial in the more habitable areas, where there would be more people. Correlation does not equal cause and effect. So, it is a fact that there are many more polar bears now than, say 30-40 years ago. It can also be true, although I have difficulty tracking the data down in a readable form, that arctic ice retreat could impact polar bear numbers adversely. One question that I have now is, if it was warmer 1000 years ago, is there evidence that there was a significant retreat of the ice back then? If that is the case, then the polar bear scare is just that...a scare. Again, many of global warming consequences that are being reported are tied to the question of the size, extent, and effects of the Medieval Warming Period. That's why, in my opinion, that is the most important question of all. ![]","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2009/Dec/22/polar-bears-data-opinions-and-global-warming/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2009/Dec/22/polar-bears-data-opinions-and-global-warming/"},{"title":"Open Information, Reproducible Research, and Climategate","text":"David Donoho , the creator of Wavelab is featured in an article about [reproducible research in the journal CISE (Computing in Science and Engineering)] . I am struck by the resonance of a couple quotes, as they apply to Climategate and Climate Modeling: The scientific method's central motivation is the ubiquity of error--the awareness that mistakes and self-delusion can creep in absolutely anywhere and that the scientist's effort is primarily expended in recognizing and rooting out error. [...] In stark contrast to the sciences relying on deduction and empiricism, computational science is far less visibly concerned with the ubiquity of error. At conferences and in publications, it's now completely acceptable for a researcher to simply say \"here is what I did, and here are my results.\" Presenters devote almost no time to explaining why the audience should believe that they found and corrected errors in their computations. The presenter's core isn't about the struggle to root out error--as it would be in mature fields--but is instead a sales pitch... [...] Many users of scientific computing aren't even trying to follow a systematic, rigorous discipline that would in principle allow others to verify the claims they make. How dare we imagine that computational science, as routinely practiced, is reliable! On ClimateAudit, there is an older article (2005) about the Hockey Stick plot. Ross McKitrick makes the suggestion of an audit panel, A group of experts fully independent of the IPCC should be assembled immediately after the release of any future IPCC Reports to prepare an audit report which will be released under the imprimatur of the IPCC itself. The audit will identify the key studies on which the Report's conclusions have been based, and scrutinize those studies, with a view to verifying that, at a minimum: data are publicly available, The statistical methods were fully described, correctly implemented and the computer code is published If the findings given maximum prominence are at odds with other published evidence, good reason is provided in the text as to why these findings have been given prominence. Any competent scientist can assess these things. My strong recommendation is that such a panel be drawn from the ranks of competent mathematicians, statisticians, physicists and computer scientists outside the climatology profession, to prevent the conflict of interest that arises because climatologists face career repercussions from publicly criticizing the IPCC. Also, participation should exclude officials from environment ministries, because of the conflict of interest entailed in the fact that environment ministries are the main financial beneficiaries of the promotion of global warming fears. The second recommendation is for a \"counter-weight panel\", whose job would be to actively try to find holes in the analysis, assumptions, etc... I'm not sure how I feel about the second one (I'll have to think about it), but the audit panel to me makes total sense. Why don't the scientific journals do this as a matter of policy? ![]","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2009/Dec/15/open-information-reproducible-research-and-climategate/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2009/Dec/15/open-information-reproducible-research-and-climategate/"},{"title":"Word of the Day: Micromort","text":"I'm not starting a new \"word of the day\" series, but I did learn this work today from the following video on risk analysis: youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1PtQ67urG4 It's an entertaining introduction to risk analysis, and they use the word micromort, referring to a measurement of the quantity of an action which gives you a 1 in a million chance of dying.

Personally, I find these comparisons misleading and dangerous. It is true that there are some who believe that climate is not changing at all, and that flies in the face of all of our knowledge of climate, weather, and the Earth system. Then there are those, like in climateaudit.org , that criticize the statistics of the data, and the possible false conclusions that can arise from that, and the lack of transparency on such an important topic. Lumping them in with the ID crowd is just ridiculous. Why is the scientific consensus on Anthropomorphic Global Warming (AGW) different than the scientific consensus on Evolution? Let me list some of the ways: Evolution has many independent, very different, lines of evidence (fossils, embryology, immunology, molecular biology, paleontology, etc...). AGW has at best 50-100 different data sets, from the dozen or so tree rings, to the dozen or so ice cores, satellite and surface temperature records. Much of our inference comes from computer simulations, that a very few completely understand. Much of global warming consensus comes from a small minority that are directly involved with the data or the simulations. We can control aspects of evolution. With knowledge of DNA, we can make genetically modified foods, we can change the course of diseases, and breed bacteria to eat nylon. Our understanding of AGW is at such a low level that we can only possibly control the climate at the grossest level. Our lack of understanding of feedback loops prevents even the most basic possible control of the system. Although evolution occurs on long time scales, we can see its action on the small scale. AGW also occurs on longish time scales, but there is no short-term equivalent. This adds to our level of control (with evolution), or lack of it with AGW. Those that are denying evolution want to replace it with something that violates not just evolution, but all of physics, chemistry, astronomy...pretty much all of science. Although the extremists in the anti-global warming camp can seem pretty anti-science, they aren't trying to replace global warming with something that violates all of science (they still might be wrong!). There is also a much more nuanced camp that admits that the planet is warmer, but perhaps it is not as special as the AGW theory would suggest, and that draconian CO2 policies are unwarranted given the uncertainties. This puts it on a very different scale than the anti-evolution group. It is dangerous to make the comparison. One is partly the demonizing of your opponent and, at the same time, angelizing (is that a word? :) ) ones own perspective: by saying that the AGW deniers are just like the evolution deniers, both makes the deniers seem unreasonable, but by association, implies that AGW is as solid as evolution. This latter claim, despite the claims of its proponents, is definitely hyperbole. ![]","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2009/Dec/11/climate-change-denial-is-not-the-same-as-evolution-denial/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2009/Dec/11/climate-change-denial-is-not-the-same-as-evolution-denial/"},{"title":"Climategate, oh my!","text":"I've been reading a lot about Climategate , and have a few comments now, and hopefully more to come. What sparked this current thread of thinking for me was this post over in the Statistical Modeling blog . He summarized the physicists perspective on the \"settled science\" in a nice way: The evidence for anthropogenic (that is, human-caused) global warming is strong, comes from many sources, and has been subject to much scientific scrutiny. Plenty of data are freely available. The basic principles can be understood by just about anyone, and first- and second-order calculations can be perfomed by any physics grad student. Given these facts, questioning the occurrence of anthropogenic global warming seems crazy. (Predicting the details is much, much more complicated). And yet, I have seen discussions, articles, and blog posts from smart, educated people who seem to think that anthropogenic climate change is somehow called into question by the facts that (1) some scientists really, deeply believe that global warming skeptics are wrong in their analyses and should be shut out of the scientific discussion of global warming, and (2) one scientist may have fiddled with some of the numbers in making one of his plots. This is enough to make you skeptical of the whole scientific basis of global warming? Really? I would love to go point by point in this quote and show the calculations, and I'd imagine that it would get stymied once I tried to put in the water vapor feedback. I need to read more about this, because from what I've read we don't understand the magnitude, or sign, of the cloud feedback and that it could easily wipe out any warming caused by CO~2~ increases. Some of the comments are very good too, like: > A. zarkov: I'm really disappointed to see you engage in the usual > group think about global warming. Have you read the Wegman report? How > come you don't refer people to ClimateAudit for the other side of the > debate? Did you know that Michael Mann had to be forced by Congress to > provide the data and codes behind the hockey stick calculation? > ClimateAudit give you everything, the data and the R code they use. > The other side stonewalls, and no wonder-- their results are a fraud. > The blog he refers to, climateaudit.org , is very interesting and is exactly the way the commenter says: they are all for open information. They post the data, the code, everything right up front and simply ask everyone else to do the same. Why this isn't required for all scientific publications, I don't know. Why it is not required for all high-stakes publications (ones that could result in very high-stakes policy) I don't know either. It's a travesty. If everyone were as open about the data and the code, Climategate couldn't have happened. One final comment on this thread: Radford, Neal: Few people ever disputed that the current temperatures are higher than those of earlier times back to four hundred years ago. The big issue has always been whether the Medieval Warm Period (usually seen as occuring around a thousand years ago) was warmer than at present, since if it was, that makes the present warming seem not so unusal and perhaps due to natural causes. This is my point too: if it was warmer 1000 years ago, then the hysterical language of the global warming media is completely unjustified. From [RealClimate.org][]: > Phil Jones in discussing the presentation of temperature > reconstructions stated that \"I've just completed Mike's Nature trick > of adding in the real temps to each series for the last 20 years (ie > from 1981 onwards) and from 1961 for Keith's to hide the decline.\" The > paper in question is the Mann, Bradley and Hughes (1998) Nature paper > on the original multiproxy temperature reconstruction, and the ‘trick' > is just to plot the instrumental records along with reconstruction so > that the context of the recent warming is clear.

First, in the blog post he mentions: It assumes that all things we call religion or religious impulses are essentially the same or have some common core. This faces the philosophical problem of properties and propositions in general. For example, take the property of redness. Is there something that all objects we call red have in common? And if there is, is this the same kind of thing we call religious belief? In fact there is something common to all things red: the wavelengths of light that are absorbed. I think what he is asking is whether we experience red in the same way as our friend. In fact, it is quite likely, and it is not a philosophical idea at all. It seems to me more and more that philosophy tries to handle questions that are out of reach for science (for the moment) but the solutions found in philosophy evaporate or are insubstantial once we really understand what is going on. Tom Mitchell has done some very interesting work with looking at fMRI data in his \"Brains, Meaning, and Corpus Statistics\" talk (talk slides on his home page ). In the work, he compares fMRI data from different individuals, and finds that he can correctly identify images and words from brain activity of one person, using the associations between the images and words derived from the brain activity of other people . This strongly suggests that the internal representations of words and concepts may be very similar between individuals. Not only that, but that we have the possibility of determining what those are and not just leave it up to philosophical ruminations. Dawkins mentions belief in authorities as a psychological tendency that may lead to religious thinking under the right circumstances. I would further add the brain's tendency for seeing patterns where there are none as the other piece of the religious-thinking puzzle. It is evolutionary advantageous to see tigers where there are none as opposed to not seeing tigers where there are some. Not all errors are equally costly. Religious interpretation of experience seems to me to easily follow from these sorts of errors. ![]","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2009/Dec/06/universality-of-religion/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2009/Dec/06/universality-of-religion/"},{"title":"A great observation","text":"So [this post][] from Laura Wattenberg's \"Baby Name Wizard\" blog has a wonderful observation: > Here's a little pet peeve of mine: nothing rhymes with orange.

It almost comes out and says that the brain is frequentist and not Bayesian, and it certainly implies it. He outlines how badly people do on the classic rare disease problem: \"frequency of a disease is 0.01%, you take a test that is 99.99% accurate (false positives at 0.01%), you test positive. What is your chance of having the disease\". People, even educated people (even in the medical fields) get this one wrong a lot. Pinker contrasts this with \"Think of 10,000 people, so we expect 1 to be infected and 9,999 to be not infected. You take the test, and the 1 person infected will almost certainly test positive, and we expect 1 person out of the 9,999 to test positive as well. We know that you tested positive, so what is your chance of having the disease?\" He claims that people are much better at getting the answer right. In my view, this is less about being good at calculating frequencies, and more about being bad at math. The second way of describing the problem pretty much sets up and carries out all of the \"difficult\" math, and then rounds so that all you have are small integer values. People do much better with that.

There is no guarantee that the electric company will use less fossil fuel than you would use, say, per mile of driving. And there is no guarantee that the electric company will use *cleaner* fuel than gasoline. Plus, batteries tend to be notoriously difficult to dispose of, and are an environmental hazard themselves when thrown out. One advantage to replacing mobile power (e.g. gasoline) with stationary power (e.g. electric company) is that one can replace the stationary power with nuclear, which you just can't do with cars. It is claimed that it will be cheaper for end users, \"In Detroit, where off-peak electricity rates are 5 cents a kilowatt hours, it will cost about 40 cents to recharge batteries overnight.\" One does have to factor in the maintenance costs, battery replacement, and battery disposal costs into the cost of owning this new car.

Most of the thermometers started out in rural areas, or in fields outside of towns, and cities were built around them. Areas around pavement are warmer than the surrounding areas, so there would be a measured warming trend due to development, not due to atmospherics. A better bet would involve predicting the global temperature for, say, 5 years from now (along with the uncertainty). Each side puts in their prediction, and pays \\$1 times the ratio of the posterior probabilities for the two models, P(M~1~)/P(M~2~). Would anyone take a bet like that? ![]","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2009/Jul/24/silly-challenge-to-silly-statement/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2009/Jul/24/silly-challenge-to-silly-statement/"},{"title":"A quick comment on error","text":"I read this article in the Week magazine, concerning the upcoming census. I plan to look at statistical sampling later, but I was struck by the following: Because supporters and opponents tend to break down along partisan lines. Democrats favor sampling because the people who are traditionally hardest to count are the urban poor, minorities, and immigrants, all of whom tend to live in Democratic strongholds and vote Democratic. These groups are often undercounted because they move so frequently and do not trust government employees asking questions. Republicans, by contrast, stress that the Constitution specifies an \"actual enumeration\" of the population, not an estimate. They also argue that statistical sampling is inferior to counting. \"Anyone familiar with public opinion polling can tell you that statistical sampling carries a margin of error,\" Republican Reps. Darrell Issa and Patrick McHenry recently wrote. \"And error is the enemy of a full and accurate census.\" The notion that a national count is completely error free is ridiculous. I think everyone would agree that if you do a count, that you will not get everyone. It is known that mistakes are made, omissions occur, and that some people actively avoid the census. Because the census avoidance is not random, the omissions are biased in some way. One can argue in which ways the bias points, but the bias is there. So what is the best plan of action in this case? You want to make an estimate of the number of people in the country. \"Estimate\" is the correct word, even for an enumeration, given the fact that the enumeration is known to be incomplete. The best thing to do, then, is to have a public and open statistical model of the process of sampling, with independent ways to confirm the validity of the model. If the model is simple, and open, it would be difficult to argue against. Without this approach, a \"strict enumeration\" is really an unstated statistical model where the assumptions are very difficult to see. ![]","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2009/Jul/20/a-quick-comment-on-error/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2009/Jul/20/a-quick-comment-on-error/"},{"title":"Laplace and the Divine","text":"In a previous post I used the word \"God\" in quotes, when referring to Laplace's view of determinism. This was done because Laplace himself did not believe in God, and I used the term as a convenience to represent a hypothetical all-knowing being. The clearest view of Laplace's perspective comes from an interaction with Napoleon. After reading Laplace's Mécanique céleste, Napoleon asked him about the lack of the reference to God anywhere in the work. Laplace responded that he had no need for that hypothesis. In a strict way, this is an agnostic perspective. The description of the universe, as described by Laplace, does not need to use the concept of God in any way. This does not disprove the existence of God, or even deny God's existence. It merely states that the concept of God is not needed. This is the pure vision of science, and why science does not necessarily conflict with religion. However, there could be certain claims from specific religions that conflict with science. The 6000 year old Earth, part of some fundamentalist Christian beliefs, is one example. The God as the mystery in the Universe is not something that can conflict with science. ![]","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2009/Jul/19/laplace-and-the-divine/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2009/Jul/19/laplace-and-the-divine/"},{"title":"Misunderstanding Laplace","text":"I finished Leonard Mlodinow's \"The Drunkard's Walk: How Randomness Rules Our Lives\" this past week, and have a couple of thoughts related to it. In Chapter 10 he quotes Laplace: > \"We may regard the present state of the universe as the effect of its > past and the cause of its future. An intellect which at a certain > moment would know all forces that set nature in motion, and all > positions of all items of which nature is composed, if this intellect > were also vast enough to submit these data to analysis, it would > embrace in a single formula the movements of the greatest bodies of > the universe and those of the tiniest atom; for such an intellect > nothing would be uncertain and the future just like the past would be > present before its eyes.\" > and Mlodinow states that this is an expression of determinism. He then further states > But for Laplace's dream to hold true, several conditions must be met. > First, the laws of nature must dictate a definite future, and we must > know those laws. Second, we must have access to data that completely > describe the system of interest, allowing no unforeseen influences. > Finally, we must have sufficient intelligence or computing power to be > able to decide what, given the data about the present, the laws say > the future will hold. > He then criticizes it with the following three problems: society is not governed (as far as we know) by definite and fundamental laws in the way physics is like Lorenz, we cannot obtain the precise data necessary for making predictions human affairs are so complex that it is doubtful we'd be able to make the calculations anyway He concludes \"as a result, determinism is a poor model for the human experience.\" His point seems to be, in some ways, obvious and in other ways irrelevant. Laplace was simply saying that \"God\" would not find anything random, because of complete knowledge. The connection between knowledge and inference, which probability theory affords, was worked out by Laplace in great detail and it known to use today as Bayesian inference. The structure of Bayesian inference describes randomness simply as the product of our ignorance of the model, the parameters, the initial conditions, the measurement details, etc... Laplace was simply saying that with perfect knowledge, there is no randomness. E.T. Jaynes would describe the \"random process\" as a mind-projection fallacy: you have ignorance of the system, so you attribute its unpredictable behavior as a product of the system itself. A rolled die is following Newton's Laws, deterministically, and detailed knowledge of the die and the roll and the surface should allow you to predict 100% of the time what it will do. We lack that knowledge, thus the behavior becomes unpredictable. We often then attribute that unpredictable behavior as a \"random die\", as if it were the die that contains the randomness and not our own ignorance. Bringing in Lorenz, and chaos theory, is irrelevant here. Lorenz's systems were completely deterministic, and it is theoretically possible for a being to know the state of the system out to a sufficient number of decimal places to provide any particularly set level of uncertainty in the system. With the quantization of states, it then becomes possible to know *exactly* what state something is in. Of course, quantum mechanics is a two-edged sword in this example: it solves the chaos problem, but adds an inherent, physical, randomness to the system which is very peculiar. The problem with Mlodinow, it seems, is that he hold human activity to be a bit too special. We are, after all, made up of atoms and would thus be governed by the laws of physics. Certainly it would be too complex to handle, for us, but Laplace was not talking about us in his quote, or at least not us right now or in the near future. !<>","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2009/Jul/19/misunderstanding-laplace/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2009/Jul/19/misunderstanding-laplace/"},{"title":"Homeopathic \"Medicine\"","text":"Homeopathic medicine \"is a form of alternative medicine, first expounded by German physician Samuel Hahnemann in 1796, that treats patients with heavily diluted preparations which are thought to cause effects similar to the symptoms presented.\" ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeopathy ).

The experiments deal with people making probability assessments about a series of statements. The experiments were done by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky[cite here]. It starts with a description: Imagine a woman named Linda, thirty-two years old, single, out-spoken, and very bright. In college she majored in philosophy. While a student she was deeply concerned with discrimination and social justice and participated in antinuclear demonstrations. They then ask for a ranking of most (1) to least (8) probable for a number of statements. The interesting three statements are: Linda is active in the feminist movement: 2.1 Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement: 4.1 Linda is a bank teller: 6.2 This is then used to say that people do not figure probabilities correctly because *\"the probability that two events will both occur can never be greater than the probability that each will occur individually\" (italics in original).* The book reports that \"even highly trained doctors make this error\", with the following example. > They presented a group of internists with a serious medical problem: a > pulmonary embolism (a blood clot in the lung). If you have that > ailment, you might display one or more of a set of symptoms. Some of > those symptoms, such as partial paralysis, are uncommon; others, such > as shortness of breath, are probable. Which is more likely: that the > victim of an embolism will experience partial paralysis or that the > victim will experience both partial paralysis and shortness of breath? > Kahneman and Tversky found that 91 percent of the doctors believed a > clot was less likely to cause just a rare symptom than it was to cause > a combination of the rare symptom and a common one. (In the doctor's > defense, patients don't walk into their offices and say things like \"I > have a blood clot in my lungs. Guess my symptoms.\" > Now, I haven't read past this point, or the original study, so take what I say here with a grain of salt. I wanted to put down my thoughts on these observations before going on to read the study's conclusions. Perhaps what I say now will be inconsistent with other aspects of the studies, or further data. **I do not think that one should conclude poor reasoning in these examples.** I believe there are two things going on here. One is a property of the English language, and the other is a property of human reasoning. In English, if I were to say \"Do you want steak for dinner, or steak and potatoes?\" one would immediately parse this as choice between 1. steak with no potatoes 2. steak with potatoes Although strict logic would have it otherwise, it is common in English to have the implied negative when given a choice like this. If we interpret the doctor's choice, we have: 1. clot with paralysis and shortness of breath 2. clot with paralysis and no shortness of breath the second one is much less likely, because it would be odd to have a clot and not have a very common symptom associated with it. It is less clear in Linda's case, but I think the same reasoning applies there. What is interesting is that the error is not seen in ranking statements which have nothing to do with the given knowledge about Linda, such as: > > Linda owns an IHOP franchise > > > Linda had a sex-change and is now Larry > > > Linda had a sex-change and is now Larry and owns an IHOP franchise > > > There might be something to being completely unrelated that changes the interpretation of the English sentence, and makes it a bit more formal, closer to the mathematical reasoning. I am not sure what types of statements would do this, but it is a bit challenging to disentangle subtle language interpretations I think. When reading these experiments, I recalled a description from E.T. Jaynes about people receiving the same new information, but updating their knowledge in a diverging way, due to differences in their prior information. I think something like that could be going on here. What I mean is, when doctors are asked: \"Which is more likely: that the victim of an embolism will experience partial paralysis or that the victim will experience both partial paralysis and shortness of breath?\" it is interpreted as: 1. someone is *claiming* that the patient has an embolism 2. the patient is *claiming,*or someone has measured, that she has partial paralysis 3. the patient is *claiming,*or someone has measured, that she has shortness of breath I don't believe the doctors are separating the analysis of the claim of the clot, which is given information, from the other claims. As Mlodinow admits, the situation where one knows the diagnosis is practically never encountered, so the doctors are really assessing the truthfulness of the existence of the clot. Because of this, the implied negative in (2) above (i.e. paralysis with no shortness of breath) is even stronger. Another way of looking at it is to include the knowledge of the method of reporting. Someone who is reporting information about an ailment will report all of the information accessible to them. By reporting only the paralysis, there are two possibilities concerning the person measuring the symptoms of the patient: 1. they had the means to measure shortness breath in the patient, but there was none 2. they did not have the means to measure shortness of breath In the first case, the doctor's probability assessment is absolutely correct: both symptoms together are more likely than just one. In the second case, the doctors are also correct: one of the sets of diagnostic results (i.e. just paralysis) is less dependable than the other set (i.e. both symptoms), thus the second one is more likely to indicate a clot or is consistent with the known clot. It isn't that the doctors are reasoning incorrectly. They are including more information, and doing a more sophisticated inference than the strict, formal, minimalistic interpretation of the statements would lead one to do. This analysis works well for other examples stated in the book, like \"Is it more probable that the president will increase federal aid to education or that he or she will increase federal aid to education with function freed by cutting other aid to states?\". Now I have to continue reading the book, and track down the study, to see if any of these thoughts pan out. !<>","tags":"wordpress_migration","url":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2009/Jul/08/erroneous-probabilistic-reasoning/","loc":"https://bblais.github.io/posts/2009/Jul/08/erroneous-probabilistic-reasoning/"},{"title":"A Little Geometry","text":"I've just finished the book \"Euclid's Window\" by Leonard Mlodinow, and really enjoyed it. The book describe the history of geometry from Euclid, Descartes, Gauss, and Einsten. During his coverage of Euclid he presents a simple proof of the Pythagorean Theorem that really resonated with me. I don't recall ever seeing a proof of it, or at least no memorable proof. This one uses a minimum of jargon and formality...you just draw the picture, discuss it for a bit, and you see it! You start with a right triangle, like: [ ] and you make two constructions, from a square with sides a+b. The first construction looks like: [ ] which, by eye, you can see that the total area of the square is the area of 4 triangles (just like our original) plus the area of the inner square, which is c*c (which reminds me that I have to figure out how to do superscripts and subscripts in this blog. :) ) The second construction is nearly the same as the first, and looks like: [ ] which, again by eye (with a little shading to make it a bit more obvious), the total area of the square is the area of 4 triangles (just like our original) plus the area of the two inner squares, which are a*a and b*b. Therefore: a*a+b*b=c*c for any triangle for which you can make this construction, which are right triangles.
