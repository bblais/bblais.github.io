									<p>I listened to a <a href="http://donjohnsonministries.org/discussion-with-naturalist-matthew-ferguson-part-1/">recent interview</a> (<a href="http://donjohnsonministries.org/discussion-with-naturalist-matthew-ferguson-part-2/)">Part 2</a>) with Matthew Ferguson
on the <a href="http://donjohnsonministries.org/">Don Johnson show</a>, which I found pretty impressive. Matthew
Ferguson has a <a href="http://adversusapologetica.wordpress.com/">very interesting blog</a> that I just found, and have
been enjoying reading.</p>
<h2 id="pandoc-initial-comments">Initial Comments</h2>
<p>However, I did find several points in the informal debate that I thought
could be handled better (from my armchair, of course!). Just to note
that although I think that if I were there, I might have been able to
deal with some of the questions better, I also think that nearly all of
the debate was handled much better than I could have done. What struck
me at one point, in <a href="http://donjohnsonministries.org/discussion-with-naturalist-matthew-ferguson-part-2/)">Part 2</a>, was Don's zeal for the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Miracles-Credibility-New-Testament-Accounts/dp/0801039525">miracles
collection by Craig Keener</a> (<a href="http://www.uncrediblehallq.net/2012/01/0shou5/review-of-craig-keeners-miracles/)">review of Keener's book here</a>). He
seemed to think that because there were hundreds of thousands of miracle
reports, that that was evidence for their truth. He was, however, quick
to dismiss any comparison with other pseudosciences. Ferguson admits on
his blog that the "debate came off as a little ambushy" on this point,
because he hadn't read this book, and clearly couldn't respond to all of
them, but I think that misses the point. I think one can address the
miracle claims without being entirely dismissive (and sounding closed
minded) but putting them in their proper context.</p>
<h2 id="pandoc-evaluating-miracle-claims---some-lessons-from-ufos">Evaluating Miracle Claims - Some Lessons from UFOs</h2>
<p>So in Keener's book, there is a <strong>huge</strong> collection of claims of
miracles. We could find an equally large collection of UFO sightings.
Now, Don and other Christians would be quick to dismiss UFO sightings as
irrelevant, but I would raise the questions:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Given a set of claims, how do we determine whether they are true?</li>
<li>Are any of them true?</li>
<li>Do the number of claims contribute to their truth value?</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe that the methods we use to determine the veracity of UFO
claims can be used to investigate any claims, remarkable or not,
including miracle claims. To start, we clearly we can't personally
investigate every single claim, and thus cannot comment on ones we
haven't investigated except to note where it seems similar to ones that
we have. I have a friend who I managed (over several years) to break of
his UFO enthusiasm - he was convinced by all of these television shows
claiming evidence for alien spacecraft observations and visitations. He
invited me over to his house periodically to watch these shows to get my
reaction. This is the process that I would use:</p>
<ol>
<li>I would write down each specific claim - what was <em>actually</em> being
    claimed, and what details were there? (names of places, time, who
    saw what, etc...)</li>
<li>I would note any initial inconsistencies (for example, there was
    once where, in the interview process, the different witnesses
    actually described <em>different</em> things! this seemed to go unnoticed
    by the reporter)</li>
<li>I would go home, and try to find out as much about the <em>original</em>
    details of the events. It would take me probably at least an hour
    for each case, and some I couldn't track down. However, many of them
    I could. I would read the claims again, and the skeptical accounts,
    and the responses to the skeptics. I would try to see what the
    actual data was, how it was collected, when it was reported, etc...</li>
</ol>
<p>What I found for <em>every</em> case that I personally investigated was the
following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Most of the <em>actual</em>, original claims were mundane. Lights in the
    sky, marks on the ground, etc.... No hard evidence of anything
    remarkable.</li>
<li>Misinterpretation of a known object, or objects, in the sky or on
    the ground.</li>
<li>The reporting of the claims grew more and more remarkable. A
    particularly good example was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendlesham_Forest_incident">Rendelsham Forest</a> UFO case
    where the initial reports were just lights, and the later reports
    involved spacecraft, alien code-books, etc...</li>
<li>There were serious inconsistencies between reports, or anomalous
    non-reports (i.e. people who <em>should</em> have seen something but
    didn't). A good example of this was a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_O'Hare_International_Airport_UFO_sighting">Chicago airport sighting</a>
    where a small group of people, in a localized area of the airport,
    saw something yet the large number of other people in the nearby
    areas of the airport reported nothing.</li>
</ol>
<p>I repeat - in <em>every single case</em> that I personally investigated, these
points were in evidence. Then I look through something like the <a href="http://files.ncas.org/condon/text/contents.htm">Condon
report</a> where they go through something like 30 years of data in the
height of the UFO craze and don't come up with even a single item that
is not mundane in its nature. After that, new UFO claims I see with
suspicion even if I don't check them out. If something seems
straightforward to check out, I might do it, but I don't feel it is my
job to investigate every claim. If there had been even a single case
which pointed to something probably remarkable, I'd have a different
attitude.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lesson: if the claims made shrink and disappear at critical and
skeptical investigation, the claim is not likely to be true.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="pandoc-miracles">Miracles</h2>
<p>The Catholic Church has a division to investigate miracles, and has
determined that some of them are genuine. However, the Catholic Church
often has significant blinders, and definitely takes a long time to
adjust to obvious mistakes (Galileo anyone?).</p>
<p>Take, for example, <a href="http://listverse.com/2008/07/14/top-10-astonishing-miracles/">this site on top 10 miracles</a>. I've personally
researched about 3 or 4 of these, and it is quite clear that those are
definitely frauds (#1, 2, 3, and 5 I've checked). Yet, do we get any
retraction from the Catholic Church? Do we get <em>any</em> hint of skepticism?
None at all.</p>
<p>Again, I follow the same steps as above. I do not take someone else's
word, necessarily, and I don't discount them out of hand. The miracles
of Fatima are a great example. First, we have "visions" from highly
impressionable children, one of whom was known to have made up fanciful
stories in the recent past. These children are the only ones who "see"
it, until the last vision where hundreds claimed to see the "Miracle of
the Sun". The problem? The initial stories did not agree, and we only
get a semi-consistent story after the various witnesses spoke with each
other and to a priest collecting the reports. Check out <a href="http://www.csicop.org/si/show/real_secrets_of_fatima/">The Real
Secrets of Fatima</a> for the details. All of the elements spoken about
above can be seen - initial mundane experiences, misinterpretation of
known objects (i.e. the sun, and clouds), the exaggeration of stories in
later recollection, serious inconsistencies in reports and notable
non-reports.</p>
<p>The same goes for every faith-healer I've read about. A little digging,
and a little skepticism, and the entire enterprise come crashing down.
Many times it doesn't take much digging!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the truth is there, then it shouldn't retreat under investigation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not a matter of being <em>too skeptical</em>. It is a matter of not
being credulous.</p>
