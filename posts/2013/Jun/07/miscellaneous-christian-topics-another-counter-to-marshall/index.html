                          <p class="mb-4">
                                <p><span style="line-height:1.5;">Over at David Marshall's blog he has
</span><a href="http://christthetao.blogspot.com/2013/06/response-to-brian-blais.html">posted a response</a><span style="line-height:1.5;"> to
</span><a href="http://brianblais.wordpress.com/2013/03/13/unbelievable-project-the-new-atheism-barry-duke-and-david-marshall-debate/">one of my Unbelievable Project
posts</a><span style="line-height:1.5;"> (sidenote: I do promise to get
back to that project...I have a number of episodes in the hopper, I just
need a block of time to type).  At any rate, let me counter again, and
see where this goes.</span></p>
<p>On the topic of "militant atheism", I pointed out a double standard in
the use of the word "militant" to atheists and islamists.  Marshall
replies</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What causes us to call them "militant," rather, is the refusal to
admit the vast amount of good that the Judeo-Christian tradition has
accomplished</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this makes my point.  Do we call Militant Islamists "militant"
because they refuse to see the good in other people?  No, it's because
they blow stuff up.   You might call the New Atheists "agressive",
"obnoxious", "misguided" or "wrong", but "militant" they are not.
 Marshall continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have more people been killed by angry Christian terrorists per
Christian in recent years, or by angry atheist terrorists?  Timothy
McVeigh was an agnostic, that would count when atheists take census
for the purpose of expanding their ranks.  The Unabomber appears to
have been an atheist. The Tamil Tigers, who do more of this sort of
thing than almost anyone, may be as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now I could counter with things like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_violence">anti-abortion violence</a>, and
that Timothy McVeigh's religious views were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_McVeigh#Political_views_and_religious_beliefs">mixed at best</a>, etc...
However I  think that, even if we grant that McVeigh was an atheist and
the Unabomber too, that they didn't do the horrible things <strong><em>in the
name</em></strong> of their atheism.  However, the anti-abortion violence, and the
historical violence of Christians, has been done <strong><em>in the name</em></strong> of
the religion.  That's a big difference, and one that seems to be
conveniently ignored.</p>
<p>Further, to compare the New Atheists (say, any of the four of Dawkins,
Harris, Hitchens, and Dennett) to any of these people, or to Stalinist
Russia, or Hitler, or any of them is totally ridiculous.  No matter how
strident they are, the New Atheists are not "militant" in the same way
that militant Islamists are.</p>
<p>On the point about "separation of church and state", which Marshall has
stated was a Christian idea, and that I had countered with: "If the
separation was truly was a Christian idea, then I’d expect a totally
different European history from 0 AD to 1700 AD! ", he counters with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But Blais is again not being reasonable about that history, either. 
First of all, Christians didn't attain much power until almost 400
AD.  And secondly, the world in which Christians then attained power
had fixed political structures, which transformed Christianity about
as much as Christianity changed it.  It is anachronistic to judge the
5th Century by what humanity has attained since.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, what you're saying, is that the Christians were victims of the
political structure such that the fundamental Christian belief of
"separation of church and state" was not able to be implemented for the
1300 year Christian rule?  Sorry, but that seems like a dodge to me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jesus also said, "Forgive your enemies."  The claim that this, too, is
a Christian idea, is not rendered "ridiculous" by the fact that
Christians have often actually killed and cursed, not forgiven, their
enemies.  An idea can be a Christian idea, even can come from Jesus'
mouth, without therefore determining all subsequent Christian history.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sure.  However, since there is no statement "separation of church and
state" anywhere in the NT, it seems like quite a stretch to make the
same claim.  One can probably find a decent number of examples of people
throughout the last 2000 years putting "forgive your enemies" to good
use, or at least claiming it is a Christian idea.  Can you find any
examples prior to the enlightenment of any Christian espousing the
separation of church and state, except in the most limited cases (e.g.
you pay taxes to government not to the church).  Clearly <strong><em>every</em></strong>
European monarchy was founded on the establishment of a direct
connection between church and state.</p>
<p>Marshall didn't seem to like my response concerning the topic of
slavery.  I said: " It is faint praise indeed that the best you can say
about the Christian stance on slavery, historically, is that some slaves
were freed so that 700 years later (!!!) some small areas in the world,
that didn’t feel that they needed slaves anymore, didn’t have slaves. "</p>
<p>His response?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Faint praise?  Tens of millions of slaves have been freed, due to the
abolitionist movements that began with praying Christians.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be clear, I am definitely against slavery, and I definitely think it
is a great thing that tens of millions of slaves have been freed.  That
wasn't the point.  The point was that Marshall said in the Unbelievable
episode:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beginning in the fourth century slaves were set free so that by the
eleventh century there were areas of western Europe free of slaves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, put another way, Christian doctrine was so anti-slavery that, when
the Christians had the most power, the best they could do was to take
700 years to rid some areas of Europe of slaves...areas that just didn't
need slaves anyway.  I don't think that's an impressive record.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sixty percent of anti-slave organizers were Christian pastors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Where does this come from?  I'd like a citation for this.  Regardless,
it doesn't surprise me.  I would also guess that most of the <em>pro</em>-slave
organizers (like George Whitefield) were also Christian pastors.  Why?
 Because, at that time (and still now, in the US) most of the people
were Christians, and further, pastors were social and political
organizers.  So as a matter of probability, this claim would seem to be
likely, and thus carries no weight in the argument.</p>
<p>Marshall continues</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is clear the New Testament condemns the slave trade, though.  It is
clear Paul told Philemon he should accept Onesimus back "no longer as
a slave, but as a dear brother."  And it ought be clear that "loving
your neighbor as yourself" is pretty hard to do if you put chains
around your neighbor's neck.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Paul also says this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Slaves, obey your earthly masters with respect and fear, and with
sincerity of heart, just as you would obey Christ. 6 Obey them not
only to win their favor when their eye is on you, but as slaves of
Christ, doing the will of God from your heart. 7 Serve wholeheartedly,
as if you were serving the Lord, not people, 8 because you know that
the Lord will reward each one for whatever good they do, whether they
are slave or free ."(<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians%206:5-6:8&amp;version=NIV">Ephesians 6:5-8</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Paul is not being particularly anti-slavery here.  This is part of the
problem - the message in the Bible is not clear, despite Marshall's
claims to the contrary.  Like fables and proverbs, you can find opposite
messages, enough to justify whatever you'd like (e.g. too many cooks
spoil the broth; many hands make light work).  As a result, you get
perspectives like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Slavery] was established by decree of Almighty God...it is sanctioned
in the Bible, in both Testaments, from Genesis to Revelation...it has
existed in all ages, has been found among the people of the highest
civilization, and in nations of the highest proficiency in the arts -
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_views_on_slavery#Opposition_to_abolitionism">Jefferson Davis, President, Confederate States of America</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is he reading the same Bible?  Is he simply dense and uninformed?  Is
the Bible so unclear that people can have such a diverse set of opinions
on it?</p>
<p>Finally, on the slavery issue, we have Marshall saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But it is unrealistic and unreasonable to expect the Bible to
institute a crusade against slavery from the get-go.  Slavery was not,
in fact, an unambiguous evil in the ancient world: the alternative (as
in Herodotus, and even in Homer) was often to just kill enemy soldiers
(or even civilians) whom you captured.  What the Bible did, was slowly
create a society, and a set of moral ideals, that made slavery less
and less important, and liberation of slaves more and more admirable,
even while glorifying labor, and enriching ordinary workers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ok, let me get this straight.  Marshall seems to be saying that the same
God that created the <strong><em>universe</em></strong>, inspired the writing of the Bible,
created our moral sense, and had a <em>direct and personal</em> hand in human
affairs from, say, 4000 BC to 50AD (at least!) couldn't come up with a
way to solve the slavery problem?  Really?  The best God could do was to
drop in some conflicting perspectives on the issue into a book so that
<strong><em>1500 years</em></strong> after that we could finally get rid of slaves?  Is it
truly unreasonable to expect a clear condemnation of slavery in a book
purporting to deliver the message of absolute morality from an
all-knowing source?  This is a remarkable claim!</p>
<p>On to ID.  One point of clarification I want to make is the following.
 Marshall tires of the lying label that I used:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As for "lying," the charge grows tedious.  New Atheists are so eager
with this charge -- even against C. S. Lewis, recently, and often
against me -- one just wishes they would choose to argue like adults,
frankly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, I was not quoting New Atheists here, I was referring to what
the conservative, Bush appointed Judge Jones said <a href="http://ncse.com/files/pub/legal/kitzmiller/highlights/2005-12-20_Kitzmiller_decision.pdf">in his decision</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is ironic that several of these individuals, who so staunchly and
proudly touted their religious convictions in public, would time and
again lie to cover their tracks and disguise the real purpose behind
the ID Policy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've also read a fair amount about ID, read many of the sources (Behe,
Dembski, others), read all of the Dover documents, followed Ken Miller's
seminars, etc...  I do not arrive at my opinions about ID entirely
uninformed.  ID is religion masquerading as science.</p>
<p>Finally, Marshall on corporal punishment and child abuse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Though I'm a little curious about calling corporal punishment -- what,
spanking a bratty child on the behind? -- "child abuse."</p>
<p>The classics work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was thinking of more extreme examples of corporal punishment than
"spanking on the behind".  Either way, however, no matter your attitude
toward spanking, the act of simply calling a child "Christian" is even
less worthy of being labeled "abuse".  I find Dawkins' language in this
example so over the top that it ceases to be useful.</p>
<p>That's it for now!</p>
