<p>See last Reagan comment..is he right? J</p>
<p>Not claiming there is a God or not...some days I think there could be
and other days I think there just can't be (especially after some awful
tragedy involving children, for example). I mentioned in an e-mail the
other day that I believe, on balance, religion has more good associated
with it than bad...and that the bad exists because humans are involved
in managing it. But, on balance, I think a country that, while
recognizing separation of government of religion, needs the 'moral
anchor' that religion provides (i.e., be good, go to Heaven; be bad, off
to Hell with you). A purely secular society, in my humble opinion, would
eventually lead to a society without an innate sense of good or
bad...'moral relativism' is what it is called these days. We're already
seeing moral relativism at play in the rampant 'political correctness'
abounding in this country.</p>
<p>In other words, while I have little use personally for organized
religion, I think it's good for other people (i.e. "do as I say, don't
do as I do"...yes, a bit hypocritical J). And I do think Reagan is right
in the last comment...on balance.</p>

<p>actually, I think religion provides a pretty poor moral system, divorced

<p>just because one doesn't believe in God, doesn't make you a moral
relativist. I think moral relativism is ridiculous and unsustainable.

<p>I think the 'moral system' is there and it's
good/beneficial...unfortunately, it often fails due to human corruption.
But unless angels magically come down from Heaven to help us operate the
mechanism known as 'religion', it will be far less than perfect...and
often less than we desire.</p>

<p>Correct...one thing doesn't automatically mean another...but it leads,
in my opinion, eventually to a society where judgments themselves are
considered to be undesirable<br>
i.e. politically incorrect<br>

<p>I'd like to see some evidence for this. I think, for right now, Sweden

<p>I think Sweden is an exception. Being 1/4 Swedish myself, I am pleased
of course that they handle their affairs well. And I wonder how secular
they really are...there is no significant number of churches in Sweden?
Or are they pagans? J And is it possible they use a moral compass based
on a Western European culture that has, as its underpinning, a moral
structure based on the Christian church?..after all, it's not like they
are in East Asia.</p>

<p>Brian, got this from Wikipedia (below in bold): a mixed bag it
seems...there was state church until 2000...as of 2010, 70% of Swedes
are members of the Church of Sweden...but religion is not a big part of
their life (17%). On balance, I'd say Sweden is not secular. The
Lutheran Church has surely brought a moral code/compass of some sort to
Swedish society over the centuries. And no...I didn't write up the
Wikipedia passage.J</p>
<p>

<blockquote>
<p>Religion in Sweden (Wikipedia):</p>
<p>Sweden was Christianized from Norse paganism in the 11th century.
Since the 16th century, Sweden has been predominantly Lutheran. From
the Protestant Reformation in the 1530s until 2000, the Lutheran
Church of Sweden (Swedish: Svenska kyrkan) was the state church. As of
2010, about 70% of Swedes are members of the Church of Sweden,
compared to over 95% in 1970, and 83% in 2000.[1] Religiosity in
Sweden plays a limited role compared to the European average. In a
2009 Gallup poll, 17% answered yes to the question "Is religion an
important part of your daily life?".[2] Less than 4% of the Church of
Sweden membership attends public worship during an average week; about
2% are regular attendees.[3]</p>

<p>vague deists, mostly, and about 1/4 atheists...seems reasonably secular
to me, because the morality arguments stem not from deism but from
theism, of which only about 1/4 are.</p>
<p>clearly not perfectly secular, but way more secular than the US, and
most measures of societal health (lifespan, infant mortality, per capita
charity, crime rate, etc...) are better in Sweden. Now, of course there
are other issues (homogeneity of the population, population size,
etc...) but this trend exists pretty much across Europe, and at minimum
proves that more religiosity doesn't necessarily improve a society.</p>

<p>Another interesting view of it by astrophysicist Bernard Haisch. He
mentions 'exceptional human experiences' below (ex. My Royal Flush
Ace-high scenario?).</p>
<p>The one thing that seems to stand out for me re: 'is there a God?' is
the organized structure of the Universe...and the ability for it to
allow organic 'life' (which may be reasonably spread throughout this
galaxies and most others). Was there some type of over-arching
intelligence that created the Universe? That's what nags at me...and
suggests that to declare there is no 'god' (or vastly superior
intelligence capable of affecting the enormous structure of the
Universe) because there is no direct proof (and there never can be
presumably) is not the end of the story. Think I'll keep hedging my bet.
J</p>
<p>One other matter bears looking at. Is 'good vs. evil' simply a
human-created phenomenon?...or is it circumstantial evidence that there
may be that over-arching intelligence somewhere in existence?</p>
<p>
> <em>
>
> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is there an intelligence behind the origin of the Universe?
Bestsellers by Christopher Hitchins,Richard Dawkins and, Sam
Harrishave denounced the evils of religion and proclaimed that science
has shown that there is no God. Their angry accusations are partially
correct. Religions have been used to justify crimes against humanity:
witness the Inquisition of centuries past or the sectarian slaughter
in the Mideast today. But the human misuse of religions and the
existence of God are very different matters.</p>
<p>A remarkable discovery has emerged in astrophysics: that key
properties of the Universe have just the right values to make life
possible. Most scientists prefer to explain away this uniqueness,
insisting that a huge, perhaps infinite, number of unseen universes
must therefore exist, each randomly different from the other. That way
ours only appears special because we could not exist in any of the
other hypothetical universes.</p>
<p>I propose the alternative that the special properties of our universe
reflect an underlying intelligence, one that is consistent with the
Big Bang and Darwinian evolution. Both views are equally logical and
beyond proof. However exceptional human experiences and accounts of
mystics throughout the ages do suggest that we live in a purposeful
universe. In The God Theory and The Purpose-Guided Universe: Believing
In Einstein, Darwin, and GodI speculate on what that purpose might
be... what that purpose means for our lives... how it might explain
the riddle of evil.</p>

<p>Brian, regarding your statistics below: I would add the 23% to the 53%
of 'I believe there is some sort of spirit or life force' and you get
76%. I think Sweden flunks the 'secular test'. The existence of 'spirit
or life force' (53%) is the driver for human desire to seek guidance for
behavior/justice from someone/something above Man. I think it's an

<p>actually, he doesn't actually say what the "exceptional human
experiences" are. if they are something like what is claimed by mystics,
then these sorts of experiences have been had by Christians, Muslims,
and atheists which demonstrates that these experience do not present any
evidence for any particular doctrine. Further, we can elicit these
experiences with chemical and electrical stimulation, which is strong
evidence that they are the product of the functioning of the brain. I am
the first to say that our knowledge of the brain is at its infancy, but
we know enough that we don't need to resort to metaphysical
interpretations of the nature of the cosmos from changes in someone
conscious experience. Sam Harris speaks to this a great deal.</p>

<p>first, nearly all of the universe is hostile to life, so it is hardly
"tuned" for the flourishing of life. second, organization is the result
of the natural laws. where do these laws come from? we don't know for
sure, yet, but some of them we can already see become unified at large
energies so there need not be as much "tuning" as one might think at
first glance.</p>

<p>sorry, you can't use that dodge either. never can be any proof? Are you
suggesting that God couldn't provide it if he wanted? Are you suggesting
that if God left an imprint into the universe, that it would not be
directly observable? if you are, then pretty much you're conceding that
there is no difference between an intelligence guiding events and
natural laws guiding events, in which case there is no point to the
intelligence. also, proof doesn't exist in science (only in math and
philosophy). all I'm looking for is evidence, and there sure isn't any,
or it's all really terrible.</p>

<p>again, look at the links I pointed to earlier from Sam Harris. this is
the issue he deals with. it's an argument, that I happen to agree with,
for an absolute morality completely divorced from any religion.</p>

<p>so you should be concerned that you're not a Muslim then, because the
Koran clearly states that those who do not follow Mohammad will be
doomed. Or you should be concerned that you're not a Buddhist... perhaps
you should hedge your bet around santa claus, or chiropracting, or
homeopathy, or the easter bunny? or the flying spaghetti monster?</p>
<p>It's a very strange god indeed that wants people to believe in him on
bad evidence.</p>

<p>I wouldn't, because spirit or life force is pretty much the vague
notions of stuff people don't understand. it doesn't guide their
actions, and certainly is not the basis of any morality. practically
speaking, Sweden (and much of Scandinavia) are *mostly* secular, and
trending more so.</p>

<p>sorry, that's not correct. it doesn't say something "above" man. those
people who believe in a life force or spirit simply believe that there
is more to man than the physical. usually they are thinking of the mind,
and their understanding of neurobiology is weak.</p>

<p>what is the "it" here? are you speaking of consciousness separate from
the brain? our understanding of consciousness is not at the point where
we can conclusively state that. there is certainly no evidence for it,
and everything so far points to consciousness arising from the
functioning of the brain.</p>
<p>One thing that is clear, historically, is that people tend to think they
are special, and build descriptions and stories around this specialness.
What is also clear historically, in every case where we have been able
to determine it, we are not special. Life molecules can arise from
non-life - the chemistry is the same. We are on a tiny planet, not in
the center of any universe, galaxy or solar system. We are one of many
solar systems, probably many with life. "heavenly matter" is no
different than "earthly matter" - the laws of physics are the same here
as across the universe and across time. humans are primates, and are
directly descended from animals that gave rise to chimps too. Our moral
sense is shared, to some extent, in other animals as well. Our brains
work like monkey brains and cat brains, and the parts work just like the
parts of worm brains.</p>
<p>To some, this is discouraging. I, however, find some comfort in the
notion that we are all connected.</p>

<p>What is cooler than seeing film of Richard Feynman (my favorite
physicist<br>
sorry, Brian<br>
) at the bongos. Ever read his book 'Surely You're Joking, Mr.
Feynman'? I even have a DVD of his 'The Missing Lectures of Richard
Feynman'...if you'd like to hear the DVD, I'd be happy to provide it.</p>
<p>I had not read your responses to my e-mail (below) when I saw you around
noon. Looks like I am making no headway. Perhaps we should have placed
these on your blog for others to view and comment?</p>
<p>When I get a chance, I'll see what kind of responses are appropriate.
Hmm...wonder if God created the Multi-verse? :-)</p>
