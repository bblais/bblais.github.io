									<p>I recently listened to an <a href="http://www.pointofinquiry.org/dr_francis_collins_the_language_of_god/">interview with Francis Collins</a> on Point of
Inquiry, concerning his book <em>The Language of God: A Scientist Presents
Evidence for Belief</em>.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Collins">Francis Collins</a> is an icon of the "scientist
who is also Christian" (along with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_R._Miller">Ken Miller</a>).  He's a converted
atheist, now evangelical Christian, but is pro-evolution, director of
the NIH, and the former director of the Human Genome Project.  I was
immediately struck by two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>he was converted to Christianity primarily by the arguments in <em>Mere
    Christianity</em>, by C.S.Lewis.  In this book, one of the main
    arguments centers around the Moral Law, it's universality and
    internal (to the human) nature of it.  I'll go into that more later.</li>
<li>he is obviously a very smart guy, so his opinions (especially on
    evolution) need to be taken seriously (at least once).  So when he
    claims that the Moral Law cannot be the product of evolution, one
    had to at least not write that comment off immediately.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, I went back and read Mere Christianity, which I had done in college
some years back. I had an immediate visceral reaction against it, as he
laid out these philosophical arguments that seemed much more like word
games and bald assertions than anything approaching truth.  I admit that
I am steeped in the methods of science, and find arguments that claim
surety yet are not testable to be empty.  In reading Francis Collins'
book, I have found that his arguments are essentially identical to
Lewis', but couched in more modern scientific language.  (As a footnote,
I was, pleasantly surprised to see that Lewis lumped evolution with
gravitation in describing laws of nature.)</p>
<h2 id="moral-law-and-the-argument-for-god">Moral Law and the Argument for God</h2>
<p>The definition of Moral Law here is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"denunciations of oppression, murder, treachery and falsehood; the
same injunctions of kindness to the aged, the young, and the weak, of
almsgiving and impartiality and honesty" [pg 24,  Collins quoting from
Lewis)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The argument for God based on the Moral Law takes on three components.
  The three components of the argument are the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Moral Law is <em>universal</em> to all human cultures.</li>
<li>Moral Law includes <em>pure altruistic</em> behavior (think Mother Theresa
    or Oskar Shindler here), which cannot be explained by evolution</li>
<li>Moral Law is <em>internal</em> to humans.</li>
</ol>
<p>(There is a fourth point, which Lewis ties specifically to Christianity,
which is that we often choose not to obey this Moral Law.  This sets up
the idea of free will, and the idea of sin.)</p>
<p>Why is altruism a problem for evolution?  Collins writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Agape, or selfless altruism, presents a major challenge for the
evolutionist. It is quite frankly a scandal to reductionist reasoning.
It cannot be accounted for by the drive of individual selfish genes to
perpetuate themselves. Quite the contrary: it may lead humans to make
sacrifices that lead to great personal suffering, injury, or death,
without any evidence of benefit. And yet, if we carefully examine that
inner voice we sometimes call conscience, the motivation to practice
this kind of love exists within all of us, despite our frequent
efforts to ignore it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He outlines three common evolutionary arguments for the origin of Moral
Law:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>One proposal is that repeated altruistic behavior of the
    individual is recognized as a positive attribute in mate
    selection. But this hypothesis is in direct conflict with
    observations in nonhuman primates that often reveal just the
    opposite—such as the practice of infanticide by a newly dominant
    male monkey, in order to clear the way for his own future
    offspring.</li>
<li>Another argument is that there are indirect reciprocal benefits
    from altruism that have provided advantages to the practitioner
    over evolutionary time; but this explanation cannot account for
    human motivation to practice small acts of con- science that no
    one else knows about.</li>
<li>A third argument is that altruistic behavior by members of a group
    provides benefits to the whole group. Examples are offered of ant
    colonies, where sterile workers toil incessantly to create an
    environment where their mothers can have more children. But this
    kind of "ant altruism" is readily explained in evolutionary terms
    by the fact that the genes motivating the sterile worker ants are
    exactlythe same ones that will be passed on by their mother to the
    siblings they are helping to create. [pg 27-28]</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>So, if you accept these points, then Collins writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the Law of Human Nature cannot be explained away as cultural
artifact or evolutionary by-product, then how can we account for its
presence? There is truly something unusual going on here. To quote
Lewis, “If there was a controlling power outside the universe, it
could not show itself to us as one of the facts inside the universe—no
more than the architect of a house could actually be a wall or
staircase or fireplace in that house. The only way in which we could
expect it to show itself would be inside ourselves as an influence or
a command trying to get us to behave in a certain way. And that is
just what we do find inside ourselves. Surely this ought to arouse our
suspicions?”</p>
<p>Encountering this argument at age twenty-six, I was stunned by its
logic. Here, hiding in my own heart as familiar as anything in daily
experience, but now emerging for the first time as a clarifying
principle, this Moral Law shone its bright white light into the
recesses of my childish atheism, and de- manded a serious
consideration of its origin. Was this God looking back at me? [pg 29]</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="an-analogy">An Analogy</h2>
<p>When I read arguments of this sort, especially the last quote from
Lewis, I am offended by the confidence of the language from a totally
flimsy and untestable statement:  "The <strong>only</strong> way in which we could
expect [a controlling power] to show itself would be inside ourselves as
an influence or a command trying to get us to behave in a certain way"
[emphasis mine].  Really?  How do you get that?  How can you test that
claim?  How do you know what options are open for a controlling power?
 Aren't you already assuming that there is something inside us, beyond
natural law (i.e. dualism), in order for this to be true?</p>
<p>I'd like to propose an analogy.  I am not sure how far this will go, and
where it will break down (as all analogies do), but I think it makes a
point.  There is a universal law, which I will call the Eating Law.
 According to this law we as humans have an internal voice telling us
that we want to eat fatty foods.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Eating Law is <em>universal</em> to all human cultures.  We differ on
    the specifics, but we all have the voice telling us what we <em>want</em>
    to eat (i.e. pringles, Big Macs,  etc...)</li>
<li>Eating Law includes <em>pure gluttony as a</em> behavior (think people who
    eat themselves to obesity and death) which cannot be explained by
    evolution.  how could behavior that reduces life expectancy, mating
    probability, and health possibly be selected for?  There are people
    who eat so much they can't even move!</li>
<li>Eating Law is <em>internal</em> to humans.  We can look at the eating
    behavior, but we'll never be able to observe the actual urge to eat
    fatty foods.</li>
<li>We often choose not to follow this law (i.e. we choose to eat salad
    instead of Big Macs)</li>
</ol>
<p>This is not simply hunger, which we can see in other animals.  It is an
urge to eat, even when you're not hungry, fatty foods.  Now, re-read
Lewis:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If there was a controlling power outside the universe, it could not
show itself to us as one of the facts inside the universe—no more than
the architect of a house could actually be a wall or staircase or
fireplace in that house. The only way in which we could expect it to
show itself would be inside ourselves as an influence or a command
trying to get us to behave in a certain way. And that is just what we
do find inside ourselves. Surely this ought to arouse our suspicions?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, we have <strong><em>two</em></strong> such laws, the Eating Law and the Morality Law.
Which one is the message from the creator?  How could we test this?  I
could probably come up with more examples of universal tendencies which
take the form of internal messages to humans, but I don't need to.
 Coming up with just one is enough to show how this argument is
completely empty.</p>
<p>I am perplexed that someone as smart as Francis Collins can't see this.
 I am further perplexed that someone would be "shocked by the logic of
this argument".</p>
