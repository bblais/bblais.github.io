topic of the "The Evolutionary Argument Against Naturalism".</p>
<p>Basic argument, from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_argument_against_naturalism">Wikipedia on Evolutionary argument against
naturalism</a></p>
<p>I haven't read the responses, so that my response will be fresh and
untainted.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Plantinga defined:</p>
<ul>
<li>N as naturalism, which he defined as "the idea that there is no
    such person as God or anything like God; we might think of it as
    high-octane atheism or perhaps atheism-plus."[12]</li>
<li>E as the belief that human beings have evolved in conformity with
    current evolutionary theory</li>
<li>R as the proposition that our faculties are "reliable", where,
    roughly, a cognitive faculty is "reliable" if the great bulk of
    its deliverances are true. He specifically cited the example of a
    thermometer stuck at 72 °F (22 °C) degrees placed in an
    environment which happened to be at 72 °F as an example of
    something that is not "reliable" in this sense[9]</li>
</ul>
<p>and suggested that the conditional probability of R given N and E, or
P(R|N&amp;E), is low or inscrutable.[19]</p>
<p>Plantinga's argument began with the observation that our beliefs can
only have evolutionary consequences if they affect behaviour. To put
this another way, natural selection does not directly select for true
beliefs, but rather for advantageous behaviours. Plantinga
distinguished the various theories of mind-body interaction into four
jointly exhaustive categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>epiphenomenalism, where behaviour is not caused by beliefs. "if
    this way of thinking is right, beliefs would be invisible to
    evolution" so P(R/N&amp;E) would be low or inscrutable[20]</li>
<li>Semantic epiphenomenalism, where beliefs have a causative link to
    behaviour but not by virtue of their semantic content. Under this
    theory, a belief would be some form of long-term neuronal
    event.[21] However, on this view P(R|N&amp;E) would be low because the
    semantic content of beliefs would be invisible to natural
    selection, and it is semantic content that determines truth-value.</li>
<li>Beliefs are causally efficacious with respect to behaviour, but
    maladaptive, in which case P(R|N&amp;E) would be low, as R would be
    selected against.</li>
<li>Beliefs are causally efficacious with respect to behaviour and
    also adaptive, but they may still be false. Since behaviour is
    caused by both belief and desire, and desire can lead to false
    belief, natural selection would have no reason for selecting true
    but non-adaptive beliefs over false but adaptive beliefs. Thus
    P(R|N&amp;E) in this case would also be low.[22] Plantinga pointed out
    that innumerable belief-desire pairs could account for a given
    behaviour; for example, that of a prehistoric hominid fleeing a
    tiger:</li>
</ol>
<p>Perhaps Paul very much likes the idea of being eaten, but when he sees
a tiger, always runs off looking for a better prospect, because he
thinks it unlikely the tiger he sees will eat him. This will get his
body parts in the right place so far as survival is concerned, without
involving much by way of true belief. ... Or perhaps he thinks the
tiger is a large, friendly, cuddly pussycat and wants to pet it; but
he also believes that the best way to pet it is to run away from it.
... Clearly there are any number of belief-cum-desire systems that
equally fit a given bit of behaviour.</p>
<p>Thus, Plantinga argued, the probability that our minds are reliable
under a conjunction of philosophical naturalism and naturalistic
evolution is low or inscrutable. Therefore, to assert that
naturalistic evolution is true also asserts that one has a low or
unknown probability of being right. This, Plantinga argued,
epistemically defeats the belief that naturalistic evolution is true
and that ascribing truth to naturalism and evolution is internally
dubious or inconsistent.[24]</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>There are certainly several things in this argument that need to be
thought out. Point (1) is certainly true: any beliefs that do not affect
behavior <em>in any way</em> would be invisible to evolution. I doubt there are
many beliefs in this category. Even something vague, like the belief in
a deist god, would at some point affect behavior in some way. Point (3)
is also uncontroversial. Point (2) I'm not sure I understand entirely,
so I'll focus on point (4).</p>
<p>There are two parts - "behaviour is caused by both belief and desire,"
and "innumerable belief-desire pairs could account for a given
behaviour" with the example of running from tigers because of various
false beliefs. The final piece of this, however, is the limited
resources of the brain. Our brain takes many computational short-cuts,
because of efficiency and limited resources. If you have a number of
different belief/desire pairs that lead to behavior, the brain will
settle on those belief/desire pairs that generalize to the largest
number of things. This will certainly be in cases where the result is
closer to reality than not. We run away not only from tigers, but also
bears, snakes, and spiders. The desire to pet or the mistaken belief
that running away is the best way to get towards an animal would not
generalize quite so well to these other creatures.</p>
<p>Plantinga uses this argument from rationality to bolster his theism - if
rationality is unlikely given naturalism and evolution, then theism is
more likely. However, he fails to notice that rationality isn't truly
the norm. Yes, we can make some astounding feats of rationality as a
collection, but it takes serious work to overcome the natural biases,
and failures of reasoning inherent in the human condition. The cognitive
short-cuts leads us to make many errors of observation, deduction, and
induction. He also fails to point out the many beliefs that people have
that are irrational but have a benefit, or the beliefs that people have
which are irrational and have no effect and thus can get carried along
without being selected against. In fact, the situation is very much like
what you'd expect from evolution - some wrong beliefs with adaptive
benefits, some wrong beliefs with no penalty, some correct beliefs by
accident, etc… Finally, even if our beliefs were 90% wrong, we'd still
be able to trust rationality <em>as a collection</em> - which is exactly what
science does. It forces fallible people to not believe things until it
can be replicated, it downplays anecdotal evidence, arguments from
authority, and recognizes the cognitive failures of humans in order to
overcome them.</p>
