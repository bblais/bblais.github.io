<p>Anonymous early works versus attributing important people, like Peter and Mary, to later works.  Early works didn't have to try to justify themselves.  attribution of a witness from the end of john, finally not mentioning the destruction of Jerusalem in 70ad, the siege of Jerusalem in 68 AD, the execution of Paul in the mid-60's not in Acts.  Ot the execution of James, even thought they do mention the execution of Steven and Philip, putting the text around 61AD{.theist}</p>
<p>Question - Ignatius and Polycarp, when did they write, did they actually quote the gospels, if they wrote around 110 does that make for a changing the early dating of the Gospels, does it then somehow make it more reliable?</p>
<p>Justin - In the Christmas story the three wise men don't actually go to the stable, and it doesn't actually say there are three of them.  Is the Christmas story cobbled together by other pagan stories, other myths? {.theist}</p>
<p>Stephen - Justin asks Stephen if Matthew and Luke were simply drawing on these other religions.  Stephen responds that they may not have been taking from them, but using the <em class="aq">"currency of the time"</em> to tell their story, and these sorts of stories were around.  he doesn't know if they were presented as fact (as Christians often claim today).  We don't know what the earliest Christians believed.  Keep in mind that the earliest Gospel (i.e. Mark) and the earliest Christian writings (i.e. Paul) don't mention the Nativity.{.atheist}</p>
<p>Theist - Some of the myths were written afterward, some of them had many stories and weren't coherent.  <em class="tq">"where is the evidence that Matthew and Mark borrowed from them?"</em>  Luke actually claims to be using eye witnesses.  Why would he suddenly bring in myth and legend?  {.theist} </p>
<p>A very quick answer to the last one is that Luke <em>claims</em> to be bringing in using eye witnesses, which could easily be to make his account seem more credible.  It certainly works for Christian apologists!{.me}</p>
<p>Theist - Either it all came from legend or none of it came from legend.  The virgin birth is tied to his life, the Resurrection.  There is no legend that has all of these components. {.theist}</p>
<p>That's a very silly argument, because even Paul doesn't include any of these components.  The Iliad and Odyssey both include real places, even if much of the story is legend and myth.  {.me}</p>
<p>Stephen - "How do you establish the virgin birth from eyewitnesses?"{.aq}  You can't!  Luke didn't have to be making things  up, he could simply be writing what other people told him, which he believed. {.atheist}</p>
<p>Stephen - Most people don't think that Adam and Eve really existed, because then you run into problems with archaeology, cosmology, etc... yet Luke has a genealogy of Jesus that goes back to Adam and Eve.  </p></p>
