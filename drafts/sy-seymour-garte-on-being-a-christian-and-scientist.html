									<p>I received these videos from the same friend who <a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2025/Jan/17/response-to-oxford-mathematician-john-lennox-destroys-atheism-15-minute-brilliancy/" rel="nofollow">sent me the one for here</a>.  Sy Garte is a biochemist who was a self-declared atheist turned Methodist.  In these two interviews on the Capturing Christianity site, he describes some of his journey and reasons for his conversion.  </p>
<p>In the first video, Dr. Garte starts outlining his background including parents who were "militant atheists".  Then we get the first clue about his eventual conversion with,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/OMBQwGzn_TE?si=-4uOYpjwp0_Pqdwt&amp;t=158" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/OMBQwGzn_TE?si=-4uOYpjwp0_Pqdwt&amp;t=158</a>:  2:38 what happened was that even even in college as a young man i began to feel there was something missing in my life so and i later realized it was some sense of spirituality which i think is very important for all people </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have found that when people say the word "spiritual" I never know what they actually mean -- and I suspect that it is something most people do not want to define.  It seems to refer to some unspecified positive emotion, akin to awe and satisfaction, or some feeling of connection to things outside themselves.  These have direct neurological correlates, and do not require there to be a "spirit" in the send of Decartes' dualism.   </p>
<p>Here, though, it points to an <em>emotional</em> motivation and not an <em>intellectual</em> one.  If someone asked me why I believe something, the first thing I would state is the evidence not how it makes me feel.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/OMBQwGzn_TE?si=-4uOYpjwp0_Pqdwt&amp;t=170" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/OMBQwGzn_TE?si=-4uOYpjwp0_Pqdwt&amp;t=170</a>:  3:10 but i found that whatever that you want to call that in science at first i was thinking well you know the science is great because it gives you a real sense of purpose a real sense of doing something good in the world and it's true you know so it's great but there was one catch which was that what i was learning in science didn't jive with the materialistic world view and i i couldn't have said it that way i just i just felt it for example uh in graduate school i learned about the process by which proteins are made in cells and that's a very complex process that involves a tremendous amount of  biomolecules interacting with each other and the complexity is just incredible and i remember feeling like a chill going down my spine i it was like this is amazing where did how did this get here and it was something that i couldn't answer
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This response sums up his driving motivation -- things are complex and hard to understand, therefore it must have been an agent making it.  He comes back to this many times, pointing out the lack of recent progress in abiogenesis, the confusing nature of quantum mechanics, as if this is good evidence for a creator -- it isn't.  This is classic "God of the Gaps" reasoning.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>later of course like most biologists i just came up with the answer which is evolution -- "evolution does everything"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually, evolution doesn't do everything -- it doesn't even attempt to explain the origin of life.  So, unless he presents something that evolution actually predicts that is shown to be false, he has no basis for criticizing it.  He does not, in fact, criticize any aspect of evolution -- he only focusses on the (still not well understood) process of abiogenesis, life from non-life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/OMBQwGzn_TE?si=-4uOYpjwp0_Pqdwt&amp;t=312" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/OMBQwGzn_TE?si=-4uOYpjwp0_Pqdwt&amp;t=312</a>:  5:12 that was all on my own and that was due to the science i was learning because the science i was learning did not support a strict atheism it did not support strict materialism.  That comes from quantum theory and it comes from you know the observer effect and all sorts of things in physics but it also came from what i was learning in biochemistry and about how life works right it just seemed that saying evolution explains everything in life was to glib you know it was too easy it didn't seem to me to be enough </p>
</blockquote>
<p>His comments that the observer effect (which he clearly doesn't understand) in Quantum Mechanics violates materialism is just wrong, his comments about how life works somehow violates materialism is also wrong.  For some reason, he has jumped to these conclusions with no evidence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/OMBQwGzn_TE?si=-4uOYpjwp0_Pqdwt&amp;t=370" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/OMBQwGzn_TE?si=-4uOYpjwp0_Pqdwt&amp;t=370</a>:  6:15 i think evolution can explain a lot but there are some key things that it cannot explain and that includes the origin of life and that's not my view even Darwin said the same thing</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is like saying that Newton's Theory of Gravity doesn't explain atoms.  Who cares?  It was never meant to explain atoms.  The Theory of Evolution was proposed to explain the diversity of life, the properties of life that look designed, peculiarities of embryo growth, the geographic distribution of species, and the interrelatedness of species both in form and function.  It does not propose mechanisms for the start of life, and should never be criticized as such.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/OMBQwGzn_TE?si=-4uOYpjwp0_Pqdwt&amp;t=438" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/OMBQwGzn_TE?si=-4uOYpjwp0_Pqdwt&amp;t=438</a>:  7:18  the priest gave a sermon about love.   love period not you know love god but just love each other love and i thought boy this is very mild</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, here he hints at the social aspect of the religious experience -- especially if you're thinking that the experience of going to Church would be negative.  So it is not surprising that he would be drawn to this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/OMBQwGzn_TE?si=-4uOYpjwp0_Pqdwt&amp;t=472" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/OMBQwGzn_TE?si=-4uOYpjwp0_Pqdwt&amp;t=472</a>:  7:52  i started looking at the bible for the first time the old testament left me a little cold i just couldn't really get into it didn't understand it much but i read the book of matthew and i read the book of acts and i found those very moving a book of acts struck me as actual history i didn't have any i was sure that this was not something anyone made up it just didn't fit so that got me thinking and and then i you know i learn more and more and as i talk about in my book i'm not going to go into detail now i had several experiences including some dreams and a waking experience that i had to attribute to the holy spirit and at that point i after many years by the way i'm talking i'm compressing two decades into this discussion but at that point i realized that christianity is true and christ was real and he lived and died and rose and i became a christian </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I've also <a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2023/Aug/14/bible-in-a-year/" rel="nofollow">read the Bible</a>, and was <a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2023/Dec/02/what-would-i-expect-to-be-in-the-bible/" rel="nofollow">not nearly as impressed as he was</a>.   When he says "book of acts struck me as actual history" shows how little he actually knows the ancient literature, and the genres at the time.  Very few biblical scholars (the exceptions are all evangelical Christians) believe that Acts is a historical document.  I comment a <a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2023/Aug/14/bible-in-a-year/" rel="nofollow">little bit of it here</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/OMBQwGzn_TE?si=-4uOYpjwp0_Pqdwt&amp;t=660" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/OMBQwGzn_TE?si=-4uOYpjwp0_Pqdwt&amp;t=660</a>:  11:00 as i mentioned abiogenesis, nobody thinks that it has anything to do with standard evolution.  [...] the general scientific idea is that life began through what's called chemical evolution and chemical evolution is very different from biological evolution because there's no natural selection and there's no replication or you see there's no mutations yeah what chemical chemical evolution is when you take chemicals you put them together and they either react or they somehow are able to do things only on the basis of chemistry without any mutation without any replication and without any natural selection</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This seems to be his major point -- that the origin of life cannot come from evolution, because the processes of natural selection and replication are prerequisites, and it can't be chemical evolution because (in his words) it is "without any replication and without any natural selection".   <a href="https://youtu.be/Hw7DG7L6Gsw?si=sAhX8kYzyI0X2v_T&amp;t=1341" rel="nofollow">In another talk</a> he claims that accurate replication is a necessity for evolution, and that doesn't happen with chemical evolution.  However, what he doesn't seem to realize is that his claim may apply to current life but doesn't apply to early life -- one can have a pretty inaccurate replication process and still provide enough material for selection to occur.  In the early stages of the formation of life on the planet, there was an abundance of resources so any small improvement would lead to exponential growth of any replicator.  It would then be advantageous to have more reliable replication so that would be selected for.  The current life on the planet reaps the benefit of billions of years of this selection, so that currently life requires accurate replication.  </p>

</blockquote>
<p>Again, his claim is that complexity must be designed -- God of the Gaps again.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/OMBQwGzn_TE?si=-4uOYpjwp0_Pqdwt&amp;t=881" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/OMBQwGzn_TE?si=-4uOYpjwp0_Pqdwt&amp;t=881</a>:  14:41 get how do you get all this how did that self-replication get there yeah it couldn't have evolved because there's no evolution and that's what i've been studying and what i published on recently uh the fact that in fact as i assumed uh using various models or i'm not going to get into that there are thresholds and if you don't start out with a cell that already is pretty good at accurate self-replication you can't do it you'll never get living cells and you'll never get evolution going </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'll have to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S030326472400039X?via%3Dihub" rel="nofollow">read this paper</a> and <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10441-020-09399-4" rel="nofollow">maybe this paper</a>, but my first thought would be that any model is only as good as the assumptions that go into it, and I suspect there are simplifications taken by Dr. Garte that will leave out critical components.  I'll write more when I have a chance to read the paper.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/OMBQwGzn_TE?si=-4uOYpjwp0_Pqdwt&amp;t=945" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/OMBQwGzn_TE?si=-4uOYpjwp0_Pqdwt&amp;t=945</a>:  15:45 so what what is the current scientific consensus about abiogenesis?   it depends who you talk to. if you talk to people who are not working in the field many of them will say oh yeah we're getting there we've got a lot made a lot of progress we know that amino acids you know were in meteors so they probably you know developed or formed in the primeval earth we know that uh nucleotides can make long polymers with rna that.  yeah that's all true but the people who are actually the leaders in these fields in this field uh know the details and the details are exactly what jim tour says it doesn't happen. you don't get long polymers you get short polymers. you don't get self-replication you get annealing you get junk rather than good stuff. that's what they know and frankly uh i think many of them are getting discouraged it looks like not a lot of progress has been made</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As an analogy, I think about the time of discovery of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superconductivity#History" rel="nofollow">Superconductivity</a> -- 1911 -- and the successful theoretical understanding of it with Cooper pairs -- 1957.   That's a span of 46 years, with a lot of research.  Even Richard Feynman was unable to solve the problem, <a href="https://web.njit.edu/~tyson/supercon_papers/Feynman_Superconductivity_History.pdf" rel="nofollow">despite a sustained effort</a> : </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Feynman: Oh, during that period I spent an awful lot of time trying to understand superconductivity. I did an awful lot of calculations and developed a lot of methods, which Iâve seen gradually developed by other people for other problems. But I didnât solve the original problem that I was trying to solve, which was, where does superconductivity come from? And so I never published anything. But I have done an enormous amount of work on it. Thereâs a big vacuum at that time, which is my attempt to solve the superconductivity problem â which I failed to do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The structure of DNA was determined in the early 1950s (around 80 years ago) and the human genome project in the early 2000s (around 25 years ago).   It is not surprising to me that the origin of life problem is not yet solved in this time frame, given that it is a <em>much</em> harder problem to explore than superconductivity ever was.  To show impatience, and to confidently claim that slow progress is due to some fundamental mistake in the science, seems to me to be incredibly short-sighted.  To further state that there can be no answer, that God had to do it, seems to me to be the height of arrogance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/OMBQwGzn_TE?si=-4uOYpjwp0_Pqdwt&amp;t=1007" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/OMBQwGzn_TE?si=-4uOYpjwp0_Pqdwt&amp;t=1007</a>:  I thought there was there's something missing and my journey to faith helped break down this absolute certainty that everything is explainable by materialistic science </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am not absolutely certain of anything -- there is always a potential way to demonstrate anything is false.  But, having said this, I am pretty confident that the Earth is not flat, that the Earth goes around the sun, that (most) diseases are caused by microbes of various kinds, that matter is made of atoms, and that humans are the product of a long chain of evolutionary events.   The reason I am confident of these things is that there have been many opportunities to demonstrate each of them false, and that hasn't happened.  Further, one alternative after another has either not made specific predictions or have had their predictions turn out false.</p>
<p>So, I would ask Dr Garte here, what predictions does his God-model make, other than the vague idea that "God started life"?  Does it tell us how that was done?   Even when?   Is there any way to test it?  Are there any novel predictions?  Or is this something he is claiming to make him feel better, to make him feel a sense that a question has been answered (even if it really hasn't)?  If he can't bring forward specific, positive predictions then he's not really doing science and just telling himself a just-so story.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/OMBQwGzn_TE?si=-4uOYpjwp0_Pqdwt&amp;t=1060" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/OMBQwGzn_TE?si=-4uOYpjwp0_Pqdwt&amp;t=1060</a>:   knowing that god did something to me is not enough.  i want to know a little more details [Laughter] i don't know if i can i don't know if anyone can ever learn that or understand that because we don't know how god works you know obviously but i want to keep looking at it and i want to keep you know investigating various hypotheses i don't think we should stop doing scientific research on the issue but i think we need to be open and it may be that biology is at the same place that physics was before Einstein came up with relativity they were kind of stuck they had solved everything except this nasty thing called light which nobody could understand and when Einstein solved light through relativity it changed physics forever and it it turned out physics was nowhere near complete and now we're in a position where you know we have a huge amount of more knowledge which makes the physical picture of the universe totally different than we originally thought and i think biology is in exactly the same place right now we need to expand our tools we need to include new concepts into our studies of biology and i'm not only the only one saying this there are even some non-theists who are saying this and uh one of those concepts may be teleology purpose perhaps we need to put purpose back into scientific equations which has been taken out of ever since Darwin.  The whole idea of evolution is it's blind right the blind watchmaker it has no direction no purpose.   Well the direction we know is wrong Simon Conway Morris has shown that there is a direction in evolution through  you know his amazing studies on the Burgess Shale and other things he's he has shown that there are constraints evolution doesn't do just anything it does only certain things and it does it over and over and over again so there's a direction.  There there are laws that seem to govern what actually can happen it's not all random chance.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everything here I agree with (other then including purpose).  I don't think that Conway Morris has made a convincing case for purpose in the process of evolution, although clearly there have to be constraints to any biological process.  Evolution tinkers, it doesn't produce much from whole-cloth.  It doesn't make very large changes quickly.  Nothing in this points to a designer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/OMBQwGzn_TE?si=-4uOYpjwp0_Pqdwt&amp;t=1228" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/OMBQwGzn_TE?si=-4uOYpjwp0_Pqdwt&amp;t=1228</a>:  20:28  i think that what we will find is that those new approaches including something like teleology are going to point even more than they do now to a divine being. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sort of thing has been suggested many many times across history and whenever we have finally figured it out, it has never been a divine being, or any other sort of agent causation.  It has always been entirely natural.  I'm betting against his prediction here, but will certainly be moved by evidence.  All he has is a frustration that the problem is hard, and that there hasn't been as much progress as he'd like, so he's falling back on "God did it".</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/OMBQwGzn_TE?si=-4uOYpjwp0_Pqdwt&amp;t=1322" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/OMBQwGzn_TE?si=-4uOYpjwp0_Pqdwt&amp;t=1322</a>:  the idea that evolution that Darwinian evolution by natural selection explains why we have morality or explains why we're creative or we love music that's just nonsense. that's not even scientific. those are stories. so what makes us human what does it mean to be in the image of god well we have a sense right everybody has a sense that human beings are not just animals who are smart some people deny that and i have never even as an atheist i never went along with that view i always knew that human beings were somehow special very special i didn't know why i didn't know where it came from but now i think i do</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, he's pointing out an obvious fact that human brains can do more than the brains of other animals, but seems to ignore all of the parallels with others in the animal kingdom -- including creativity and morality.  It is the standard human-centered arrogance that he is espousing and I don't see a qualitative difference here just a quantitative one -- a matter of degree.  He also is appealing to our innate intuition of specialness, where the history of human thought -- from thinking we were the center of the solar system, to the universe, to designed by a different process than the animals -- has all converged on the fact that we are not particularly special.  It's hard for a species to hear such a thing, but it is the truth.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This is perhaps the weakest evidence I have heard.  People love dreams and have been reading into them probably since the advent of language itself, but it is quite clear that dreams are not a reliable guide to reality.  Nothing in his description of the dreams would be convincing to anyone else, which should give him pause in using it as a reason for his theism.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>I could have gotten just about as much guidance from a Tarot card reading.  </p>

</blockquote>
<p>I do believe that <a href="https://bblais.github.io/posts/2010/Dec/01/are-science-and-religion-incompatible/" rel="nofollow">science and religion are incompatible</a>.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brian Blais - "At its core, however, religious thinking and scientific thinking are nearly opposites. Â Religious thinking relies on anecdotes, statements from authority, faith without evidence, and mistakes of causation from correlation. Â Each of these mistakes arise from common human failings of reason and perception, for which the scientific methods have been developed to avoid. Â To do proper science one does not rely on anecdotes or authority, other than nature as the final arbiter. Â Evidence is everything, and certain knowledge is never achieved in science (as opposed to religion). Â So it is no wonder that the more scientific you are, the less appeal religion tends to have. Â But it also makes you less susceptible to the various guises of pseudoscience and less susceptible to being hoodwinked by cranks and quacks."</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/cXBIhtFyH9g?si=QmghzvOHtH7Cb23t&amp;t=1111" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/cXBIhtFyH9g?si=QmghzvOHtH7Cb23t&amp;t=1111</a>:  18:31 agency into your explanations how did you resolve that conflict that potential conflict between miracles on the one hand and the greatest Miracle of all time the resurrection how did you you know integrate that into your scientific worldview as a scientist yeah I I with with surprisingly little difficulty and all all all I answer all I had to do was say yeah there's a lot of things we can't explain but we know are true we don't</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/cXBIhtFyH9g?si=QmghzvOHtH7Cb23t&amp;t=1144" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/cXBIhtFyH9g?si=QmghzvOHtH7Cb23t&amp;t=1144</a>:  19:04 call them Miracles um now and it doesn't mean that God stepped in and did them but the fact that we can't explain the resurrection doesn't didn't bother me at all because there are many things we can't we can't explain what a quark is you know we can't we can't explain what a uh what we can't explain what charge is why is an electron negative and a proton on positive I mean you know we can we can talk about it we can describe it but we don't really explain</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/cXBIhtFyH9g?si=QmghzvOHtH7Cb23t&amp;t=1682" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/cXBIhtFyH9g?si=QmghzvOHtH7Cb23t&amp;t=1682</a>:  28:02 you know some Greeks and then later the original Christian Scientists began studying the laws of nature trying to show that there were such things and they were amazed nobody thought that the same law that it works on Earth would would exist everywhere that in the universe so when Newton showed that that was true that was considered and was an an amazing breakthrough in knowledge that there are these universal laws of nature that apply everywhere and all the</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/cXBIhtFyH9g?si=QmghzvOHtH7Cb23t&amp;t=1850" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/cXBIhtFyH9g?si=QmghzvOHtH7Cb23t&amp;t=1850</a>:  30:50 with genetics okay and we you're gonna have to break this down yeah for me and the audience yeah uh I'm not going to write down the equation but it's fairly simple it tells you what how the the various forms of a gene which are called alals how the alal frequency changes and the reason that was important was because when people first heard about Evolution they didn't understand and then they heard about uh uh the early genetics so that there are dominant and recessive genes and people thought well if there's a dominant gene eventually it's going to</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/cXBIhtFyH9g?si=QmghzvOHtH7Cb23t&amp;t=1887" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/cXBIhtFyH9g?si=QmghzvOHtH7Cb23t&amp;t=1887</a>:  31:27 just take over and that's the end there won't be in so how do you get Evolution and there were two mathematicians who heard about this independently Hardy and Weinberg two different guys and they came up with a formula that showed that no there's an equilibrium between the dominant and the recessive forms of the Gene and uh it stays it stays constant unless there's a selection for one of those Al and then it can change and that's how</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/cXBIhtFyH9g?si=QmghzvOHtH7Cb23t&amp;t=1920" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/cXBIhtFyH9g?si=QmghzvOHtH7Cb23t&amp;t=1920</a>:  32:00 that's sort of one of the equations for evolution uh and shows that Evolution Rel results in the change in AAL frequency and that equation is useful but it's often violated it there are so many exceptions to that because uh sometimes you get a an a third Al which then Works in concert with one of the other two biology is so immensely complicated</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/cXBIhtFyH9g?si=QmghzvOHtH7Cb23t&amp;t=2177" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/cXBIhtFyH9g?si=QmghzvOHtH7Cb23t&amp;t=2177</a>:  36:17 there a little uh one of my best friends is an atheist of course they all my friends were atheists were they surprised yeah everybody was surprised she was this this one particular person was um surprised but very accepting quite a few people had that kind of reaction I think probably somewhere inside them they were saying gee too bad I thought he was a smart [Laughter] guy uh others others uh were a little</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/cXBIhtFyH9g?si=QmghzvOHtH7Cb23t&amp;t=2723" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/cXBIhtFyH9g?si=QmghzvOHtH7Cb23t&amp;t=2723</a>:  45:23 need you know don't I need an indoctrinate a of course whatever no no you have the spirit you have the Holy Spirit with you it's clear so come next Sunday you'll be baptized and that's what happened I think this story is going to resonate with our Protestant audience the Catholic audience might be a little bit upset at hearing the the whole bureaucratic issue well they may be upset but they're lucky because they you know they either they they came from a</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/cXBIhtFyH9g?si=QmghzvOHtH7Cb23t&amp;t=2754" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/cXBIhtFyH9g?si=QmghzvOHtH7Cb23t&amp;t=2754</a>:  45:54 Catholic Family or they married someone who was Catholic they didn't have the kind of background I had yeah yeah my background was tough uh so there's just no hope for you to join the Catholic church I haven't found any that may oh that would be different now I'm already baptized oh okay so since I'm baptized I think that will not be a problem I'm not sure I'm not sure I'd have to talk to a priest about that okay but I have also lost my interest I'm perfectly happy in the Methodist Church I don't blame you uh I've risen</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/cXBIhtFyH9g?si=QmghzvOHtH7Cb23t&amp;t=2787" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/cXBIhtFyH9g?si=QmghzvOHtH7Cb23t&amp;t=2787</a>:  46:27 from being baptized five years later I became the lay leader in not no not five years two years later do you do you teach it all I have done I've given some courses uh in the church within the church sure what do you teach on well it's an interesting story you know I I also learned a lot about other Christians uh I thought well you know the Catholics already accept evolution at least at the top but I didn't know about Protestants so I after I joined the pastor asked me if I would give a class on science and evolution and I said okay I'll try to explain what it is I thought maybe 10 or 10 people might</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/cXBIhtFyH9g?si=QmghzvOHtH7Cb23t&amp;t=2825" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/cXBIhtFyH9g?si=QmghzvOHtH7Cb23t&amp;t=2825</a>:  47:05 show up and there was 60 people came and I started out by saying okay uh how many people here uh believe that evolution is basically true and I thought maybe one or two people would raise their hand I think it was 58 people raised their hand 58 out of 6 58 out of 60 the two who didn't uh i l convinced so that was a wakeup call I said well wait a minute what's going on here I thought Protestants you know</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/cXBIhtFyH9g?si=QmghzvOHtH7Cb23t&amp;t=2855" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/cXBIhtFyH9g?si=QmghzvOHtH7Cb23t&amp;t=2855</a>:  47:35 right well no it turns out the majority of Protestants totally accept mainstream science you know the I mean the young Earth creationism which by the way I I am not strongly opposed to Young Earth creationism I don't think it's correct MH but I have no argument I have very good friends who are scientists and young Earth creationists and we work together on various things that are well you're about to meet another one at the conference yes I know Marcus Ross exactly and he's excellent he's so good</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/cXBIhtFyH9g?si=QmghzvOHtH7Cb23t&amp;t=2886" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/cXBIhtFyH9g?si=QmghzvOHtH7Cb23t&amp;t=2886</a>:  48:06 yeah and and you know they have some good arguments uh it turns out that I think most of those arguments are refutable MH and I'm sure Michael will refute them but because he's not a he's not a degreed scientist but he knows a lot of science yeah yeah so um but I don't have any argument with them theologically because they're interpreting the Bible in a way which I don't agree with but it's legitimate and I I I don't think anyone</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/cXBIhtFyH9g?si=QmghzvOHtH7Cb23t&amp;t=2919" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/cXBIhtFyH9g?si=QmghzvOHtH7Cb23t&amp;t=2919</a>:  48:39 has the right to say no you're wrong about the Bible if you're a Believer if you understand that Christ Rose and and from the dead and is our Salvation you're a Believer and you want to interpret the Old Testament differently okay it doesn't hurt me uh you're a Christian I'm a Christian as long as we both agree on that I don't care uh I'm not out to prze for a scientific Viewpoint that's not my job it's not my</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/cXBIhtFyH9g?si=QmghzvOHtH7Cb23t&amp;t=2953" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/cXBIhtFyH9g?si=QmghzvOHtH7Cb23t&amp;t=2953</a>:  49:13 interest but you know having said all that I I found out that young Earth creationism is actually derives originally from Seventh day adventism and then was EV eventually absorbed into the Southern Baptist convention in the' 60s after the uh the book The Genesis Flood came out Henry Morris it's not it's not the original interpretation of scripture at all it's a brand new 19th century interpretation</p>
