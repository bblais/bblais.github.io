<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>
<p>Tom - New Testament point of view is that faith is something profoundly logical and rational, involves our mind as part of the worship of God. {.theist}</p>
<p>Hemant - <em>"All the atheists I've met have been very nice, although in the media atheism is often associated with </em>'angry'<em class="aq"> atheists."</em>}  Some people thought that he was going against the grain by being friendly. although in his experience, all the atheists he knew were pretty friendly.{.atheist</p>
<p>Hemant - people mistake Dawkins tone as angry, when it is really his passion.  atheists often have very bad experiences with debates, not because of the outcome, but simply because they've agreed to do it in the first place.  But, people <em>are</em> talking about atheism more than ever, <em>because</em> these books are out there..{.atheist}</p>
<p>Tom - <em>"I agree, that truth comes before what you feel."</em>  Jesus connected to their concerns, but didn't water down the truth..{.theist}</p>
<p>The theist here, Tom, is very pleasant and I'd like to see what he's written.  I doubt I will agree with it much, but he seems particularly rational, and pleasant.{.me}</p>
<p>Tom - <em class="tq">"Faith is defined as kind of knowing that results in a kind of doing."</em>, <em class="tq">"Faith is inextricably linked with living it out."</em>}{.theist</p>
<p>Hemant - One of the things that happened when he went to some of the mega-churches is that they would pass out envelopes with money, and tell them to go spend it making a difference in the community.  Or people who were motivated from their church to go, for example, and do an "extreme makeover" of someone's house who needed it because it was the right thing to do. .{.atheist}</p>
<p>It is true that people need these communities and maybe even the motivation of other people around them, to be the best they can be, to find the <em>"better angels of their nature"</em>.  So far churches fit that niche.  I just wish there were more secular alternatives for this sort of thing, because there isn't anything specific to the religious message that gives them a monopoly on charitable actions.{.me}</p>
<p>Tom - Reasons don't have to be massively intellectual.  <em class="tq">"The historical Jesus, if he really did do and say all that in the Bible, grew back limbs in plain sight, predicted the future, ..., rose from the dead.  If he did all that stuff, then our search for God is probably over.  The question then becomes, did he really do and say all that stuff?  That's not a particularly complicated argument"</em>}{.theist</p>
<p>We could pretty much say the same thing for Zeus or Hercules.{.me}</p>
<p>Tom - At 59:50, twelve "facts" agreed upon by even the skeptical new testament scholars.{.theist}</p>
<p>This list is definitely <em>not</em> agreed upon by most NT scholars, especially the skeptical ones.{.me}</p>
<p>Tom - <em class="tq">"When it comes to the crunch times in life, you really want to know that these things are real.  ...  I could not demand of God the proof that I wanted him to produce for me, but to sit back and say 'God, if you're really God, what have you done in history and to be open to that happening'"</em>}{.theist</p>
<p>God should know what would convince me, and the fact that I haven't even remotely been convinced tells me that God is unwilling to convince me, he is unable to convince me, or God does not exist.{.me}</p>
