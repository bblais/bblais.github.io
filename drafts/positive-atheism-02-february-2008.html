<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>
<p>David - The word <em>atheism</em> is a reaction to <em>theism</em>, and is thus negative.  He doesn't like the word but admits that it is probably a little late to change it.  Likes <em>positive</em> atheism, to stress the positive aspects of it.  He disagrees with the negativity that Dawkins has.  He said that the famous Marx quote "religion is the opiate of the masses" is commonly interpreted to mean that one should get rid of religion, when in fact he meant that once you have a free society, religion would be come superfluous. {.atheist}</p>
<p>Justin - suggests that most people don't really give much thought to the idea of God, somewhat agnostic, and that maybe atheism is arrived at through a choice - something happening in your life, as a reaction to theism.{.theist}</p>
<p>Justin's point is very interesting, and perhaps there is some merit to that.  There is a difference between someone who doesn't believe in God because it is simply a non-issue and those that don't believe in God due to a negative experience or assessment.  In my own situation, in college when I was going through this process, I thought of it as a choice - there was a point where I decided to become an atheist.  A that time I was essentially a deist, having not been even remotely convinced by the flurry of arguments I had had with Christians recently.  I realized that deism was <em>content-free</em>, and thus indistinguishable from atheism in any practical way.  Some of this comes own to labels, and I have come realize that labels are not always useful in discussions, and it is best to focus on the questions <em>what do you believe?</em> and <em>why do you believe it?</em> {.me}</p>
<p>David - Religion has a positive effect on society, for example the history of art.  If you took religion out, what would you be left with?{.atheist}</p>
<p>That, to me, is a ridiculous statement.  It's like saying, what would happen if you took Santa Claus out of Christmas?  Would there be nothing good in Christmas?  Do you need to have something to replace Santa Claus?  Certainly not.  People find wonder in all things, and although the history of art might have been quite different, I would love to have seen a Leonardo da Vinci inspired by the Hubble Space Telescope and the Large Hadron Collider. {.me}</p>
<p>Anna - Where does an atheist get his/her meaning in life?  If you take atheism to its natural conclusion, aren't we just atoms and molecules?  If there is no supernatural element to us, then this is all coming out of matter.  Nothing really beautiful.  {.theist}</p>
<p>David - Just because you think of things in terms of matter, doesn't mean that you are nihilistic, or can't understand concepts such as beauty.{.atheist}</p>
<p>Anna - Everything is just matter, then we have cause and effect, and <em class="tq">"beauty could be calculated"</em>.  You could write a computer program to generate beauty.  Beauty and music would have to be more than just cause and effect.  {.theist}</p>
<p>I don't think that breaking down our explanation of complex things into atoms, say, makes the beauty less - it makes it more!  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRmbwczTC6E">Feynman talks about this</a>, and says that the beauty of the flower is available to him in addition to the beauty of the cells, the processes, the atoms, etc...  {.me}</p>
<p>Anna - If I told my spouse that I loved them because of the chemicals in my brain, that wouldn't be very satisfying.  It seems to be more than me, more than us.  {.theist}</p>
<p>Further, I'd say that understanding the details of digestion and olfaction does not in any way reduce my appreciation for chocolate.  There is a subjective part of the experience, that I can enjoy, and I can enjoy the explanation of the process by which that subjective experience is produced.  I feel that Anna is truly not appreciating the world in all of its glory, and I fear that a lot of Christian and religious thought produces that.  It makes people satisfied with a simple, trite, answer for things and demotivates them to attempt to grasp the truth of the world that science gives us.{.me}</p>
<p>Anna - can atheism really motivate people to change?  knowing that there is something beyond you to help you through a difficult time, when you've given up, is motivating in a way that atheism can't be. {.theist}</p>
<p>Justin - we live in a capitalist society, with many people rich and wanting to stay that way.  What's to change someone from being naturally selfish to being generous? {.theist}</p>
<p>If you value the well-being of others, rather then simply the dictates of a religion, you're more likely to be generous.  Religions often motivate people to be generous to those who are seen as being in the in-group, and not as much in the out-group.  This question can be addressed empirically as well.  However, it can be confounded.  For example, it has been claimed that the religious give more than the non-religious.  This is <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2013/11/28/are-religious-people-really-more-generous-than-atheists-a-new-study-puts-that-myth-to-rest/">explored here in detail</a>, but it comes down to the fact that most charitable giving goes to churches, and not the poor, and is thus not a good measure of charity.  {.me}</p>
