<blockquote>
<p>Kamil: this is actually one of the strongest reasons for me to doubt the eyewitness testimony behind the Gospels especially if you think that the Gospels were written in the genre of Greco-Roman historical biography.  [...] if you think that, then it's actually really, really unexpected that the authors of the Gospel of Mark and the Gospel of Matthew, for example, don't explicitly say they are based on eyewitness testimony.  Because eyewitness testimony was very highly valued in ancient historigrapphy and I find it consistently over and over again. When it's the case that the historian in question actually had eyewitness testimony available, that they were the eyewitnesses themselves or they had access to eyewitness testimony, they say that explicitly in the text.  It is actually very, very difficult to find instances where it's the case that they had access to eyewitnesses but they don't actually proactively disclose it. [...] I would absolutely expect Mark to say "this account is based on the memory of Apostle Peter". I would absolutely expect, for example, the Gospel of Matthew to say, I Matthew, The Apostle was called by Jesus or something like that because that's exactly what we observe over and over again in other historical accounts</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an example of data which is expected on the hypothesis of eyewitness testimony, which is seemingly required for the McGrews to make any headway in their case to support the Resurrection.  This data is also simply not dealt with, or written off as an argument from silence (which it isn't).  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kamil:  So this is like a one piece of evidence that massively goes against the hypothesis of eyewitness testimony that actually, for me, the strength of that evidence is so overwhelming that it actually overcomes all of the early Christian attestation to the authorship</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>James: We're about to get to looking at the the data that we're then going to compare explanations against . And what we'll see is that when they reject or argue against non resurrection explanations, they are happy to pick literally any detail from the gospels that suits their purpose. Very specific, very particular, minute sometimes detail. And the question would be, "Well, why should we accept that that is the case?" And it seems to me that we're going to have to go beyond a general reliability to get to that. We're going to actually have to go to like, basically, this was written not just by an eyewitness, but someone with a really good memory and got all of the details down. So by feeling free to appeal to all of these details, they're actually setting up a very high standard for themselves in terms of how confident can we be in these details. So to put it another way, it's very much not a minimal facts approach. We'll see the sort of details that they're appealing to and like it really does, then heavily rely on how reliable we think all of these details are. </p>

<p>Here is the first of many examples where they argue against a claim by appealing to the fact that it is <em>intrinsically highly improbable</em> -- which is a prior, the part of the calculation that they are definitely not talking about with respect to theists claims.  As Bart Ehrman pointed out, it might be improbable -- but it is more probable than a miracle!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kamil: Yeah, but but it's always the case with minimal effects, right? Like you start by saying, this is just a list of minimal facts. And yes, that's true.  30 minutes later. It's no really, there were people who thought they saw Jesus eating a piece of fish in front of them. So how do you explain that a naturalism, right? They could not have hallucinated it because it was tactile and hallucinations are not like interpersonal and tactile. </p>
<p>Brian: I always find it telling that the list of minimal facts never seems to be an agreement from one apologist to another. </p>
<p>Kamil:  The swoon hypothesis is specifically aimed against Muslims, right? Because in the Koran, it says that Jesus didn't really die, but how they argue against it actually doesn't have any force against what the Muslims believe. Because in the Koran, it says that Jesus didn't die, but it looked like he did. So like Allah made it look like he died, which is obviously completely consistent with the historical account, right?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nathan: so when they compare the evidence, they say, how do we expect the evidence to look given "not the resurrection", right? Well, that would be exactly the same in that case because the evidence would look exactly the same, so it shouldn't do anything to that numerator denominator distinction. The ratio should just remain, but they don't do that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And note again, that they criticize the swoon hypothesis because it is "intrinsically improbable", which is the prior they don't want to have to address on their own view </p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/yeCBpO7pSRM?t=11611">Time stamp 3:13:31</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nathan: They say one of the problems here for the skeptic who goes with this and I don't think any of us do go with the swoon theory. But he says, for example, you've got to "dismiss John's account of the spear wound as inauthentic". Well, that theory actually coheres with other details like, for example, the mistranslation of prophetic fulfillment.  It might be the case that they were reading the Septuagint to figure out what happened about Jesus life.  I think like that coheres quite nicely. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Pasted image 20220430133210.png" src="https://bblais.github.io/images/Pasted image 20220430133210.png"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nathan: they go on to talk about this John Dominic Crossan, something that his theory and then they say, you know, that his "radical position", well everything that they're saying is radically out of line with New Testament scholarship.  But it's again, just not the type of language that you really expect from an academic volume.</p>
<p>James: Look, when <em>they</em>  say something, it's an "inference". It's an "argument". It's "based on evidence", "growing body of evidence" when <em>someone else</em> says it. Oh, it's just a "guess". It's a "mere extrapolation". It's a "radical position". It's just fluff. Like, there's no actual distinction here between what different people are doing. It's just whether they agree with that or they don't agree with that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/yeCBpO7pSRM?t=12143">Time stamp 3:22:23</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kamil: I'd also also like that there is no shortage of people who believe that a person was raised from the dead, even though that person has a known burial location that supposedly contains the body.  it demonstrates two things. First of all, that people who hold the belief that the person was raised are not interested in actually confirming that with physical evidence.  They don't  sneak up into the graveyard and dig up the grave to see if it has a body in it. Probably exactly for the reasons like if they were actually presented with the body they'd  probably dismiss it. And second of all, the other people who don't share that belief are not interested in debunking it by exhuming the person and showing the body  because it's more important for them not to disturb  the burial customs of the person than to debunk that specific claim.</p>
<p>You know, there is the famous Jewish rabbi (Menachem Mendel Schneerson) who claims to be a messiah. And apparently, they are still people who believe that he was resurrected, even though there is a zero empirical evidence for it. He actually has a known burial location. And also what's very important to realize is that even the people in the position of leadership in that specific sect of Judaism denied that claim. There were actual leaders who said, "no, he wasn't raised." But despite all of that, yeah, there are still adherents. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This point, to me, shatters the entire apologetic edifice around the Resurrection.  To have a parallel case like this, where all of the boxes are checked for belief, with the only difference between this rabbi and Jesus is that we have fewer pieces of evidence concerning Jesus.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>James: The point that I wanted to make with that example is though, that to say that" oh well, they must have had really good evidence, right? And their opponents mustn't, if anything, good to say, because if they did, then that would have dissuaded the people from from believing it." But we've just given a couple of examples. I cite a number more in my book about irrational belief persistence. There's so many cases of this that the claim that they would have stopped believing unless they had good evidence, there's just no reason for thinking that --  it's just assertion. There's so much evidence that that isn't the case. That's just not how people work in these contexts. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>James: <span class="math">\(W\)</span> Is women's testimony, <span class="math">\(D\)</span> is for the disciples, which includes seeing and being willing to die and <span class="math">\(P\)</span> is for the conversion of Paul. So these are the three main facts that they wanting to put in their sort of Bayesian calculation, And they're going to say that these facts here are overwhelmingly more likely  under the resurrection hypothesis than other than not-resurrection hypothesis. So that's what the next few sections are going to be is going through each of these in turn. </p>
<p>Brian: Make sure every time you see this, instead of saying, you know, the women who claim to have found the tomb empty or there were disciples who claim to have appearances of the resurrection,  say instead that that we have <em>texts</em> that say that there are women who claim to have found the empty tomb, that we have <em>texts</em> that say that there were post resurrection appearances of Jesus.  The data is not the claim itself, it's not the story,  it's the fact that we have a <em>text</em> that has the story.</p>

<p>Just now watching the part about the conversion of Paul, and thinking about some back-of-the-envelope calculations. They give this a Bayes factor of 10^3, and the likelihood given ~R is 10^-4. So that would mean the likelihood given R is 1/10. That seems crazy high imo, and it's not even clear that they should want a likelihood that high. If that's the case, and if, as I think is plausible, there's nothing special about Paul, they should give comparable likelihoods to every other non-persuaded jew getting an appearance from jesus. So the Bayes factor for every person who Jesus didn't appear to would be ~9/10 and so would count against the resurrection. But then it takes about sixty jews not getting an appearance from jesus to counterbalance the appearance to Paul. But A LOT more than sixty jews didn't get an appearance from Jesus. I wonder what they'd say if you tried to argue that each of the million or so jews who didn't get an appearance contributes an independent 9/10 to the bayes factor, so the final figure is somewhere around (9/10)^1000000 ~ 10^-50000.</p>

<p>Yeah, I've thought of this as well. They like to count the outsider Paul's conversion as evidence but what about all the Jews and Romans in Jerusalem who could have seen or heard about these things and didn't convert? Shouldn't that be factored in as showing the evidence must not have really been that compelling? Aside from Paul, the only people who Jesus appeared to were already close followers of his or knew him very well before his death. That looks a little suspicious because they would have already been biased towards believing this sort of thing if their leader Jesus really was making apocalyptic predictions.</p>

<p>Well that was interesting, for certain values of "interesting." I'd be hard pressed to create a more comprehensive straw man of the positions Lydia and I actually hold. Does anyone who has read our work, and in particular our recent work, think that this podcast actually engages with our positions, much less our arguments? Did the podcasters even bother, for example, to glance at the index of TMOM or EOB to look for "Synoptic Problem"?</p>
