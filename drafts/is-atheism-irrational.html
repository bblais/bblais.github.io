</p>
            <p><p>In a recent <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/is-atheism-irrational/">New York Times article</a> we have an interview with Christian philosopher Alvin Plantinga, on the topic of the rationality of atheism.  He runs off the rails pretty early, but makes some comments that can be reasonably formulated in terms of probability theory, and thus be demonstrated to be mathematically reasonable or not, as the case may be.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I take atheism to be the belief that there is no such person as the God of the theistic religions.</p>
<p>But lack of evidence, if indeed evidence is lacking, is no grounds for atheism. No one thinks there is good evidence for the proposition that there are an even number of stars; but also, no one thinks the right conclusion to draw is that there are an uneven number of stars. The right conclusion would instead be agnosticism.</p>
<p>Clearly we have a great deal of evidence against teapotism. For example, as far as we know, the only way a teapot could have gotten into orbit around the sun would be if some country with suﬃciently developed space-shot capabilities had shot this pot into orbit. </p>
<p>The so-called “problem of evil” would presumably be the strongest (and maybe the only) evidence against theism. It does indeed have some strength; it makes sense to think that the probability of theism, given the existence of all the suﬀering and evil our world contains, is fairly low. But of course there are also arguments for theism. Indeed, there are at least a couple of dozen good theistic arguments. So the atheist would have to try to synthesize and balance the probabilities. </p>
<p>I should make clear rst that I don’t think arguments are needed for rational belief in God. In this regard belief in God is like belief in other minds, or belief in the past. </p>
<p>One presently rather popular argument: fine-tuning. Scientists tell us that there are many properties our universe displays such that if they were even slightly diﬀerent from what they are in fact, life, or at least our kind of life, would not be possible.</p>
<p>G: But even if this ne-tuning argument (or some similar argument) convinces someone that God exists, doesn’t it fall far short of what at least Christian theism asserts, namely the existence of an all-perfect God? Since the world isn’t perfect, why would we need a perfect being to explain the world or any feature of it?</p>
<p>A.P.: I suppose your thinking is that it is suﬀering and sin that make this world less than perfect. But then your question makes sense only if the best possible worlds contain no sin or suﬀering. And is that true? Maybe the best worlds contain free creatures some of whom sometimes do what is wrong. Indeed, maybe the best worlds contain a scenario very like the Christian story.</p>
<p>I’d say a world in which this story is true would be a truly magnicent possible world. It would be so good that no world could be appreciably better. But then the best worlds contain sin and suﬀering.</p>
<p>A.P.: Some atheists seem to think that a suﬃcient reason for atheism is the fact (as they say) that we no longer need God to explain natural phenomena — lightning and thunder for example. We now have science.
As a justication of atheism, this is pretty lame. We no longer need the moon to explain or account for lunacy; it hardly follows that belief in the nonexistence of the moon (a-moonism?) is justied. A-moonism on this ground would be sensible only if the sole ground for belief in the existence of the moon was its explanatory power with respect to lunacy. (And even so, the justied attitude would be agnosticism with respect to the moon, not a-moonism.) </p>
<p>A.P.: The most important ground of belief is probably not philosophical argument but religious experience. Many people of very many diﬀerent cultures have thought themselves in experiential touch with a being worthy of worship. </p>
<p>Basically, these come down to the serious limitation of human autonomy posed by theism. This desire for autonomy can reach very substantial proportions, as with the German philosopher Heidegger, who, according to Richard Rorty, felt guilty for living in a universe he had not himself created. Now there’s a tender conscience! But even a less monumental desire for autonomy can perhaps also motivate atheism.</p>
<p>First, if materialism is true, human beings, naturally enough, are material objects. Now what, from this point of view, would a belief be? My belief that Marcel Proust is more subtle that Louis L’Amour, for example? Presumably this belief would have to be a material structure in my brain, say a collection of neurons that sends electrical impulses to other such structures as well as to nerves and muscles, and receives electrical impulses from other structures.
But in addition to such neurophysiological properties, this structure, if it is a belief, would also have to have a content: It would have, say, to be the belief that Proust is more subtle than L’Amour.</p>
<p>Evolution will select for belief-producing processes that produce beliefs with adaptive neurophysiological properties, but not for belief-producing processes that produce true beliefs. Given materialism and evolution, any particular belief is as likely to be false as true.</p>
<p>Here’s why. If a belief is as likely to be false as to be true, we’d have to say the probability that any particular belief is true is about 50 percent. Now suppose we had a total of 100 independent beliefs (of course, we have many more). Remember that the probability that all of a group of beliefs are true is the multiplication of all their individual probabilities. Even if we set a fairly low bar for reliability — say, that at least two-thirds (67 percent) of our beliefs are true — our overall reliability, given materialism and evolution, is exceedingly low: something like .0004. So if you accept both materialism and evolution, you have good reason to believe that your belief-producing faculties are not reliable.
But to believe that is to fall into a total skepticism, which leaves you with no reason to accept any of your beliefs (including your beliefs in materialism and evolution!). The only sensible course is to give up the claim leading to this conclusion: that both materialism and evolution are true. Maybe you can hold one or the other, but not both.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Broadly speaking, they’ll make every attempt to distance themselves from explicit statements like “no god(s) exist”, but only when discussing definitions.  This distancing is painful at times, especially when they dodge and refuse to answer simple questions such as: true or false, God exists.  Or, do any gods exist? Direct answers are difficult to come by</p>
