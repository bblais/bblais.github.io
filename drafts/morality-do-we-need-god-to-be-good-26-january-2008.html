<ul>
<li>Full Title: <em>Unbelievable? 26 Jan 2008 Morality - do we need God to be Good? - 26 January 2008 -- Morality - do we need God to be Good?</em>
    &gt; Marilyn Mason, a humanist&nbsp;and Gavin McGrath, a Christian,&nbsp;join Justin as they discuss where they get their sense of "right and wrong" from.&nbsp; Gavin says that without God we can't make sense of morality - Marilyn disagrees.</li>

<li>Justin Brierley - Christian Moderator</li>
<li>Gavin McGrath - Christian</li>
<li>Marilyn Mason - Atheist</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>
<p>Marilyn - Atheism is a negative (i.e. lack of a belief), humanism is a positive (i.e. I don't believe in God, so what next?).  How should I constrain my life, how should I pursue relationships, etc...{.atheist}</p>
<p>I'm already impatient with this episode.  This guy (the theist) goes on and on about his own story, and is not very direct.{.me} </p>
<p>Marilyn - You put together a toolkit, which is a human-based toolkit, of empathy, applied rationality, the effects of our actions, etc...  <em class="aq">"The basic principles of kindness and compassion, of avoiding harm and suffering, of doing your best to increase well-being rather than decrease it, those I think remain constant"</em> {.atheist}</p>
<p>This is Sam Harris' <em>Moral Landscape</em> in summary.  Once you recognize that morality deals with the well-being and suffering of conscious creatures, the actions of individuals and societies can be measured against that, and there are objective correct and incorrect answers (in principle) to questions of morality.  In practice, one can come up with reasonable approximations to this objective measure. {.me}</p>
<p>Gavin - You don't have to be Christian to be moral, that moral behavior is an <em class="tq">"echo of God's creation"</em>.  Essentially something that is congruent to that creation, so you wouldn't expect it to be limited to Christianity.  He goes on to talk about when a conflict comes in.  <em class="tq">"When there is a conflict, an injustice, it seems to be more than just pragmatics, it seems more than that."</em>  {.theist}</p>
<p>Marilyn - It's not much easier for a Christian to navigate through these moral dilemmas as it is for a non-Christian.{.atheist}</p>
<p>The theist is making the claim that basing morality on God helps you through these moral dilemmas, and I think the atheist is absolutely right.  I am, and she is, more or less Utilitarian.  Sam Harris says that the issue is with making sure that your utility function is broad enough to handle complex consequences.{.me}</p>
<p>Marilyn - Even with the New Testamant, you have to do interpreting and selecting and so one.  <em class="aq">"Who is actually doing that?    You're doing it!"</em> {.atheist}</p>
<p>Gavin - We have to step back and ask <em class="tq">"Why are we even wasting our time talking about this?, why does it matter that we are more humane?  How do we know what more human means?"</em> {.theist}</p>
<p>His point is that the justification comes from God, and that gives meaning to the question in the first place.  I'd say that it is a direct consequence of consciousness, and the ability to experience well-being and suffering.  Once you have that framework, suddenly the definition of human stems from well-being, the reason for being humane stems from avoiding, as Sam Harris puts it, the worst-possible-misery-for-everyone scenario.{.me}</p>
<p>Marilyn - <em class="aq">"It matters because I would rather live in a good world than a bad world.  I would like to see less suffering."</em>{.atheist}</p>
<p>Gavin - If there is no judgement, no justice, then this conversation doesn't matter.  How do you know you're judging it correctly? {.theist}</p>
<p>Marilyn - I don't know, but if I were a Christian, I would not be certain to know the mind of God.{.atheist}</p>
<p>What she is pointing out here is that Christianity, or the Bible, does not make a justification for morality for the following reasons:{.me}</p>
<ol>
<li>we are using extra-scriptural motivation when choosing which of the Bible's edicts to follow, and how to follow them{.me}</li>
<li>we could be misreading the message, and thus be confident that we have the right interpretation{.me}</li>
</ol>
<p>I would add two more points, stolen partially from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthyphro">Euthyphro</a> dilemma,{.me}</p>
<ol>
<li>Are the things that God does good, in and of themselves (in which case being good is more fundamental than God, and thus God is not necessary), Are the things that God does good because he does them (in which case mass-murder could be good, if God commands it, and the nature of morality is meaningless){.me}</li>
<li>How did one determine that God is the good one and Satan is the bad one?{.me}</li>
</ol>
<p>That last point really gets one thinking about the nature of good and evil in the Christian worldview.{.me}</p>
<p>Marilyn - Even Christians don't follow Jesus entirely.  Jesus says to turn the other cheek, but do we turn the other cheek to tyranny and injustice?  No!  Therefore, I'm judging Jesus in this way.  Do they see all their things?  No!  They are interpreting the words.  {.atheist}</p>
<p>Gavin - There are <em class="tq">"clearer teachings"</em> in the Bible, and the reason that these things (like slavery) are wrong is they they go against the <em class="tq">"clearer teachings"</em> in the New Testament.  Are there complexities?  Yes.  Are there differences of practice?  Yes.  But there is a consensus about what is implied for Christian moral behavior. {.theist}</p>
<p>I'd like to ask why the <em class="tq">"clearer teachings"</em> in the Bible was not clear to people even 200 years ago?  I'd like to ask why there was a <em class="tq">"consensus about what is implied for Christian moral behavior"</em> 200 years ago that included owning slaves, and treating women as inferiors, and yet Doug is not willing to claim that these are part of the consensus now...if this so-called clear message can change across time, then it is not clear.{.me}</p>
<p>Here's something I never really thought about before.  In the Bible we have dictates, like "turn the other cheek", without any context.  What happens is people then apply their context, or impose it, and thus can justify nearly anything.  A moral message without the context is not a very useful one.  Determining the correct context determines the message, and thus one is doing Secular Moral Reasoning in the end anyway. {.me}</p>
<p>Because we do this so naturally, people don't seem to recognize that they themselves are the author of their moral code.{.me}</p>
