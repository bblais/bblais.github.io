<h3>Description of Episode</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Full Title: <em>Unbelievable? 18 Aug 2007 - Atheist and Christian
    bloggers discuss - 18 August 2007 -- Two bloggers discuss God, faith
    &amp; Church - Ian Thorpe &amp; Jenni Hutchinson</em>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ian Thorpe is an atheist and Jenni Hutchinson a Christian. They
got chatting about faith after bumping into each other on the
internet. They discuss whether the church is having a beneficial
effect on society, Ian's concerns over "fundamentalism" and
whether you need to believe in God to be good.<br />

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>Ian - He's concerned about the rise of Fundamentalism, and feels that
you don't have to be a theist to be good.</p>
<p>Jenni - Jesus as an icon (like clicking Excel - it leads to you to
Excel). It is easier to be good when one is in a community , get
support, etc... Also one should take the lesson from Jesus, and not act
superior or shun those that are sinful but engage them in dialog and
offer help.</p>
<p><strong>Me - religions have had hundreds of years of constructing communities
and support structures that just aren't there for atheists. humans need
community, and you get a lot of those benefits from being in a religious
community.</strong></p>
<p>Justin - I believe that we have an innate selfishness. Theologically we
attribute this to the Fall, and it comes out very early on. Hopefully
society helps to inculcate us with some values, but it does seem as if
this selfishness is getting worse. What's the solution to that? Can we
help ourselves, or do we need someone else? I would say that as a
Christian that Jesus Christ is what makes the difference, that's where
you have a hope of seeing change.</p>
<p><strong>Me - It might turn out that, for some people, they need to
believe that there is someone there even when the isn't anyone there.
This, however, does not speak to the truth of it. I'd ask, would a
Christian have the same positive attitude if you replace Jesus Christ in
the above with Allah - would you be supportive of more Islam in your
community, because of the positive influence it has on youth, turning
them around, because they come to recognize the power of Allah? It seems
to me that this is another case of <em>"if you agree with me, I want more
of you, otherwise, no thanks."</em></p>
<p>Perhaps, knowing this about human psychology, we could figure out a way
of getting the benefits without all of the superstitious
nonsense.</strong></p></p>
