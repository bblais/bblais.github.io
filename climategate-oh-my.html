            <p>I've been reading a lot about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climatic_Research_Unit_e-mail_hacking_incident">Climategate</a>, and have a few comments
now, and hopefully more to come. What sparked this current thread of
thinking for me was <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/archives/2009/12/climategate_how.html">this post</a> over in the <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/mlm/">Statistical Modeling
blog</a>. He summarized the physicists perspective on the "settled
science" in a nice way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The evidence for anthropogenic (that is, human-caused) global warming
is strong, comes from many sources, and has been subject to much
scientific scrutiny. Plenty of data are freely available. The basic
principles can be understood by just about anyone, and first- and
second-order calculations can be perfomed by any physics grad student.
Given these facts, questioning the occurrence of anthropogenic global
warming seems crazy. (Predicting the details is much, much more
complicated). And yet, I have seen discussions, articles, and blog
posts from smart, educated people who seem to think that anthropogenic
climate change is somehow called into question by the facts that (1)
some scientists really, deeply believe that global warming skeptics
are wrong in their analyses and should be shut out of the scientific
discussion of global warming, and (2) one scientist may have fiddled
with some of the numbers in making one of his plots. This is enough to
make you skeptical of the whole scientific basis of global warming?
Really?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would love to go point by point in this quote and show the
calculations, and I'd imagine that it would get stymied once I tried to
put in the water vapor feedback. I need to read more about this, because
from what I've read we <strong>don't</strong> understand the magnitude, or sign, of
the cloud feedback and that it could <strong>easily</strong> wipe out any warming
caused by CO~2~ increases.</p>
<p>Some of the comments are very good too, like:</p>
<p>

> </p>

<p>The blog he refers to, <a href="http://climateaudit.org/">climateaudit.org</a>, is very interesting and is
exactly the way the commenter says: they are all for open information.
They post the data, the code, everything right up front and simply ask
everyone else to do the same. Why this isn't required for all scientific
publications, I don't know. Why it is not required for all high-stakes
publications (ones that could result in very high-stakes policy) I don't
know either. It's a travesty.</p>
<p>If everyone were as open about the data and the code, Climategate
couldn't have happened.</p>
<p>One final comment on this thread:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Radford, Neal: Few people ever disputed that the current temperatures
are higher than those of earlier times back to four hundred years ago.
The big issue has always been whether the Medieval Warm Period
(usually seen as occuring around a thousand years ago) was warmer than
at present, since if it was, that makes the present warming seem not
so unusal and perhaps due to natural causes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is my point too: if it was warmer 1000 years ago, then the
hysterical language of the global warming media is completely
unjustified.</p>
<p>
From [RealClimate.org][]:

> Phil Jones in discussing the presentation of temperature
> reconstructions stated that “I’ve just completed Mike’s Nature trick
> of adding in the real temps to each series for the last 20 years (ie
> from 1981 onwards) and from 1961 for Keith’s to hide the decline.” The
> paper in question is the Mann, Bradley and Hughes (1998) Nature paper

> ‘hidden’ in plain sight), not using the data in the plot is completely

<p>A <em>must read</em> is the <a href="http://meteo.lcd.lu/globalwarming/Holland/Bias_and_Concealment.pdf">article by David Holland</a>, <br />
which outlines the problems with the hockey-stick analysis. He explains
the divergence problem, and the <br />
history of all this far better than I can summarize here.</p>
