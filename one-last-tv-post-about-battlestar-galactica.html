        <div class="span8 offset2 article-content">

            <p>No TV posts for a while after this one...just trying to clear my desk.</p>
<p>There are a number of things that bother me about BSG. This list is here
for anyone who<br>
wants to challenge me on any of this, comment please! It's in the form
of loose-fitting<br>
notes, written over the course of watching the series. There are
spoilers, etc...</p>
<p>​1) <br>
Once they find out that Cylons look like us, and they consider a Cylon<br>
detector, they seem to hand the entire problem over to Dr. Baltar. <br>
There seems to be no consideration about whether he is a Cylon, or<br>
in league with the Cylons. What could they do differently? Have the <br>
Dr make something that is independently testable, perhaps by Gaita or<br>
others. They don't even consider it.</p>
<p>​2) <br>
I find it straining in the extreme to believe that there is no <br>
straightforward test to tell a Cylon from non-Cylon, given the actions<br>
and words of the various people. Cylons:<br>
1) are stronger than people<br>
2) do not tire<br>
3) are able to be uploaded, at least at death<br>
4) have backs that glow under certain conditions<br>
5) have fiber optic interfaces in their arms!</p>
<p>points 1 and 2 would almost certainly leave indicators in the muscle<br>
cells, as well as brain waves. point 3 on brain waves, and point<br>
4 certainly should be detectable. point 5 should be obvious!</p>
<p>At other points, they say that they are basically indistiguishable,<br>
which to my mind means that they have organic processes (even if<br>
artificially made), and even their brain activity is the same, to the <br>
point of being indistinguishable from a person. If that is the case,<br>
then it seems weird to talk about them having "software, not emotions".</p>
<p>It's a looks like a duck, acts like a duck, every possible measurement<br>
confirms it's a duck, but it's not a duck? Sorry, that's just too hard<br>
to swallow.</p>
<p>So you have the problem that, either, they are very different in which<br>
case they should be detectable, or they are identical, in which case<br>
they are no different than humans. The writers seem to want it <br>
both ways.</p>
<p>What would my solution be? If these models were designed for the
express<br>
purpose of infiltratration into the fleet, then there would have been <br>
a lot of work to make them undetectable. I would say that the innards<br>
would be clearly mechanical/organic, with an organic outside. The
inside<br>
would broadcast signals to fool scans, like MRI and CAT scans, while<br>
the outside would have blood, sweat, etc... to fool observation there.<br>
It wouldn't be too hard to imagine that the only way to test for such<br>
a thing would entail tests that would be lethal to a person, which <br>
might solve some of the writers' problems.</p>
<p>Whenever someone said "they aren't human, they are machines" I cringed,
and wanted<br>
to reply: what do you mean by machines? In which ways are they machines
and humans<br>
aren't? throughout the series, the cylons were humans when convenient,
and <br>
machines when convenient. I don't think the writers had a consistent
vision of <br>
what the cylons were, or wanted.</p>
<p>​3) WTF is the cylon plan. They want all humanity destroyed, but then<br>
they seem to want humans for procreation and love. They say they want<br>
to protect Sharon's baby, and then the next episode (!) they launch<br>
an all-out attack on the fleet. They have well hidden spies in the<br>
Galactica who could have done damage to the ship, that was going to <br>
be a museum anyway, and they were unable to destroy it? How hard would<br>
it have been to put one of those Cylon viruses in the computer,
dormant,<br>
and then when the fleet was assembled have it relay random jump points<br>
to all of the fleet, and then send the Galactica into a star?</p>
<p>The writers seem to use Cylon attacks, and then Cylon pleasantness or<br>
incompleteness, for convenience. It's back to the "not like us, just<br>
like us" problem above which leads to inconsistent behavior. I think<br>
there was no plan, so these inconsistencies keep compounding over time.</p>
<p>​4) In flight of the Phoenix, when they disabled a huge number of cylon</p>
<p>raiders, why didn't they capture some of them for use later? Seems<br>
like a major tactical failure.</p>
<p>​5) In the 1st season episode when they were looking for Starbuck, who
had<br>
crashed on a planet with a cylon, Com. Adama said to his son that if it<br>
were his son that was lost, that he'd never stop searching. That family<br>
was most important. Why, then, in the last episode, is Com. Adama quick<br>
to leave his son, knowing that Roslin was only going to be around for<br>
a short while, and that both would now be alone.</p>
<p>​6) In Pegasus, why is Baltar's angel surprised at seeing a beat-up <br>
number 6? Why does she say "it's me", when it really isn't?</p>
<p>​7) if ressurection ships are so important, why not guard them better?<br>
why not have 2 ressurection hubs? why not a more distributed system?</p>
<p>​8) how far away really is the Cylon homeworld?</p>
<p>​9) in E16 2nd season, Sacrifice, we have people who claim the fleet are</p>
<p>cylon sympathizers and hold hostages. Not 2 episodes before, it was all<br>
about cylon sympathizer groups trying to force gallactica to try to get<br>
peace with the cylons. Each lasts 1 episode, and no more. so much<br>
of this would have been better with a plan, built up over several <br>
episodes.</p>
<p>​10) at the beginning of each episode they have a 1-minute "what has <br>
gone before", and then after the credits they have a 30-second flash<br>
of images from the episode. it is as if they don't trust the extended<br>
storyline structure, and they feel that a gimic is needed to entise <br>
viewers to stay.</p>
<p>​11) in Season 3 episode 8, Bulldog returns in a cylon raider after <br>
being gone for 3 years. Doc Cottle does a quick DNA test to match it <br>
against his military record, and concludes he's not a cylon. Wow! They<br>
couldn't do that in Season 1? It certainly would have made a huge <br>
difference. As plot holes go, that one is pretty darn big.</p>
<p>​12) I find it mindboggling that a race that has mastered organic <br>
technology cannot<br>
a) do a proper quarrantine<br>
b) diagnose a simple virus, that Doc Cottle can in a short while</p>
<p>​13) why do the cylons want a new home? why Earth?</p>
<p>​14) the incessant use of flashbacks I think is because there isn't a <br>
plan, and this makes it look like there is a consistent backstory</p>
<p>​15) the episodes with the coup, ending in the execution of Zarek and<br>
Gaeta...some of the best that the show has had. I'd say, that the best<br>
episodes have been:</p>
<p>Miniseries<br>
Pegasus - Resurrection<br>
New Caprica rescue<br>
Coup (S4ep 13-14)</p>
<p>Notice that these are all the human stories. the cylon stories are not<br>
nearly as good.</p>
<p>​16) Episode 15, when Tyrol tells Adama that the ship is slowly breaking</p>
<p>up, and there is cylon tech that can help suddenly Adama is anti-cylon<br>
tech? he changes his mind later, but still, this is inconsistent with<br>
the previous episodes when he was immediately fine upgrading jump
drives. <br>
why the sudden change of heart?</p>
<p>​17) when the BG makes it's final jump, Adama says: "whereever we are,
that's where we're going to stay"</p>
<p>...of course, until the rest of the fleet gets there, and we continue
with the <br>
original plan. Why did Adama say this?</p>
<p>​18) don't build a city at the end? don't use the technology? that <br>
seems like an idea from an idealist but not very practical - a sure way<br>
to reduce life expectancy in your new home</p>
<p>​19) Adama is a cylon. Kara is the harbinger of death. Baltar and Six
will be the mother<br>
and father of the human race. prophecies that don't pan out.</p>
<p>​20) from someone else, but exactly what I was thinking:<br>
"""<br>
When the season 1 [of Babylon 5] was aired JMS knew why Babylon 4 had <br>
appeared and what<br>
meant the visions saw there... when the first Shadow cruiser appeared <br>
in season 1 he fully knew what it was and who was behind it.. when in <br>
season 1 they talked about why Sinclair was so important and what <br>
secret he had..</p>
<p>All was shorted out in advance.. he even writed "scape doors" in case <br>
some actor stepped out of the series.. like happened with Michael <br>
O'Haire (Sinclair) left at the end of season 1.. he used a scape <br>
door introducing Sheridan..JMS has said he had scape doors for Delen, <br>
Garibaldi, etc..</p>
<p>You think BSG writers knew there was going to be 2 earths? <br>
Or who the remaining 8 models were going to be? Or even that Tigh <br>
and Tyrol were Cylons?... you think they really knew<br>
what the Opera house visions really meant? Or what the plan was?<br>
"""</p>
<p>​21) It seems to me that there would be a fool-proof way of killing a
cylon <br>
without it able to download: instantly drop it in the engine. unless the</p>
<p>download is able to be done in nanoseconds, there wouldn't be anything
left <br>
to download from.</p>
