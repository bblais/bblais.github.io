            <p>No TV posts for a while after this one...just trying to clear my desk.</p>
<p>There are a number of things that bother me about BSG. This list is here
for anyone who<br />
wants to challenge me on any of this, comment please! It's in the form
of loose-fitting<br />
notes, written over the course of watching the series. There are
spoilers, etc...</p>
<p>​1) <br />
Once they find out that Cylons look like us, and they consider a Cylon<br />
detector, they seem to hand the entire problem over to Dr. Baltar. <br />
There seems to be no consideration about whether he is a Cylon, or<br />
in league with the Cylons. What could they do differently? Have the <br />
Dr make something that is independently testable, perhaps by Gaita or<br />
others. They don't even consider it.</p>
<p>​2) <br />
I find it straining in the extreme to believe that there is no <br />
straightforward test to tell a Cylon from non-Cylon, given the actions<br />
and words of the various people. Cylons:<br />
1) are stronger than people<br />
2) do not tire<br />
3) are able to be uploaded, at least at death<br />
4) have backs that glow under certain conditions<br />
5) have fiber optic interfaces in their arms!</p>
<p>points 1 and 2 would almost certainly leave indicators in the muscle<br />
cells, as well as brain waves. point 3 on brain waves, and point<br />
4 certainly should be detectable. point 5 should be obvious!</p>
<p>At other points, they say that they are basically indistiguishable,<br />
which to my mind means that they have organic processes (even if<br />
artificially made), and even their brain activity is the same, to the <br />
point of being indistinguishable from a person. If that is the case,<br />
then it seems weird to talk about them having "software, not emotions".</p>
<p>It's a looks like a duck, acts like a duck, every possible measurement<br />
confirms it's a duck, but it's not a duck? Sorry, that's just too hard<br />
to swallow.</p>
<p>So you have the problem that, either, they are very different in which<br />
case they should be detectable, or they are identical, in which case<br />
they are no different than humans. The writers seem to want it <br />
both ways.</p>
<p>What would my solution be? If these models were designed for the
express<br />
purpose of infiltratration into the fleet, then there would have been <br />
a lot of work to make them undetectable. I would say that the innards<br />
would be clearly mechanical/organic, with an organic outside. The
inside<br />
would broadcast signals to fool scans, like MRI and CAT scans, while<br />
the outside would have blood, sweat, etc... to fool observation there.<br />
It wouldn't be too hard to imagine that the only way to test for such<br />
a thing would entail tests that would be lethal to a person, which <br />
might solve some of the writers' problems.</p>
<p>Whenever someone said "they aren't human, they are machines" I cringed,
and wanted<br />
to reply: what do you mean by machines? In which ways are they machines
and humans<br />
aren't? throughout the series, the cylons were humans when convenient,
and <br />
machines when convenient. I don't think the writers had a consistent
vision of <br />
what the cylons were, or wanted.</p>
<p>​3) WTF is the cylon plan. They want all humanity destroyed, but then<br />
they seem to want humans for procreation and love. They say they want<br />
to protect Sharon's baby, and then the next episode (!) they launch<br />
an all-out attack on the fleet. They have well hidden spies in the<br />
Galactica who could have done damage to the ship, that was going to <br />
be a museum anyway, and they were unable to destroy it? How hard would<br />
it have been to put one of those Cylon viruses in the computer,
dormant,<br />
and then when the fleet was assembled have it relay random jump points<br />
to all of the fleet, and then send the Galactica into a star?</p>
<p>The writers seem to use Cylon attacks, and then Cylon pleasantness or<br />
incompleteness, for convenience. It's back to the "not like us, just<br />
like us" problem above which leads to inconsistent behavior. I think<br />
there was no plan, so these inconsistencies keep compounding over time.</p>
<p>​4) In flight of the Phoenix, when they disabled a huge number of cylon</p>
<p>raiders, why didn't they capture some of them for use later? Seems<br />
like a major tactical failure.</p>
<p>​5) In the 1st season episode when they were looking for Starbuck, who
had<br />
crashed on a planet with a cylon, Com. Adama said to his son that if it<br />
were his son that was lost, that he'd never stop searching. That family<br />
was most important. Why, then, in the last episode, is Com. Adama quick<br />
to leave his son, knowing that Roslin was only going to be around for<br />
a short while, and that both would now be alone.</p>
<p>​6) In Pegasus, why is Baltar's angel surprised at seeing a beat-up <br />
number 6? Why does she say "it's me", when it really isn't?</p>
<p>​7) if ressurection ships are so important, why not guard them better?<br />
why not have 2 ressurection hubs? why not a more distributed system?</p>
<p>​8) how far away really is the Cylon homeworld?</p>
<p>​9) in E16 2nd season, Sacrifice, we have people who claim the fleet are</p>
<p>cylon sympathizers and hold hostages. Not 2 episodes before, it was all<br />
about cylon sympathizer groups trying to force gallactica to try to get<br />
peace with the cylons. Each lasts 1 episode, and no more. so much<br />
of this would have been better with a plan, built up over several <br />
episodes.</p>
<p>​10) at the beginning of each episode they have a 1-minute "what has <br />
gone before", and then after the credits they have a 30-second flash<br />
of images from the episode. it is as if they don't trust the extended<br />
storyline structure, and they feel that a gimic is needed to entise <br />
viewers to stay.</p>
<p>​11) in Season 3 episode 8, Bulldog returns in a cylon raider after <br />
being gone for 3 years. Doc Cottle does a quick DNA test to match it <br />
against his military record, and concludes he's not a cylon. Wow! They<br />
couldn't do that in Season 1? It certainly would have made a huge <br />
difference. As plot holes go, that one is pretty darn big.</p>
<p>​12) I find it mindboggling that a race that has mastered organic <br />
technology cannot<br />
a) do a proper quarrantine<br />
b) diagnose a simple virus, that Doc Cottle can in a short while</p>
<p>​13) why do the cylons want a new home? why Earth?</p>
<p>​14) the incessant use of flashbacks I think is because there isn't a <br />
plan, and this makes it look like there is a consistent backstory</p>
<p>​15) the episodes with the coup, ending in the execution of Zarek and<br />
Gaeta...some of the best that the show has had. I'd say, that the best<br />
episodes have been:</p>
<p>Miniseries<br />
Pegasus - Resurrection<br />
New Caprica rescue<br />
Coup (S4ep 13-14)</p>
<p>Notice that these are all the human stories. the cylon stories are not<br />
nearly as good.</p>
<p>​16) Episode 15, when Tyrol tells Adama that the ship is slowly breaking</p>
<p>up, and there is cylon tech that can help suddenly Adama is anti-cylon<br />
tech? he changes his mind later, but still, this is inconsistent with<br />
the previous episodes when he was immediately fine upgrading jump
drives. <br />
why the sudden change of heart?</p>
<p>​17) when the BG makes it's final jump, Adama says: "whereever we are,
that's where we're going to stay"</p>
<p>...of course, until the rest of the fleet gets there, and we continue
with the <br />
original plan. Why did Adama say this?</p>
<p>​18) don't build a city at the end? don't use the technology? that <br />
seems like an idea from an idealist but not very practical - a sure way<br />
to reduce life expectancy in your new home</p>
<p>​19) Adama is a cylon. Kara is the harbinger of death. Baltar and Six
will be the mother<br />
and father of the human race. prophecies that don't pan out.</p>
<p>​20) from someone else, but exactly what I was thinking:<br />
"""<br />
When the season 1 [of Babylon 5] was aired JMS knew why Babylon 4 had <br />
appeared and what<br />
meant the visions saw there... when the first Shadow cruiser appeared <br />
in season 1 he fully knew what it was and who was behind it.. when in <br />
season 1 they talked about why Sinclair was so important and what <br />
secret he had..</p>
<p>All was shorted out in advance.. he even writed "scape doors" in case <br />
some actor stepped out of the series.. like happened with Michael <br />
O'Haire (Sinclair) left at the end of season 1.. he used a scape <br />
door introducing Sheridan..JMS has said he had scape doors for Delen, <br />
Garibaldi, etc..</p>
<p>You think BSG writers knew there was going to be 2 earths? <br />
Or who the remaining 8 models were going to be? Or even that Tigh <br />
and Tyrol were Cylons?... you think they really knew<br />
what the Opera house visions really meant? Or what the plan was?<br />
"""</p>
<p>​21) It seems to me that there would be a fool-proof way of killing a
cylon <br />
without it able to download: instantly drop it in the engine. unless the</p>
<p>download is able to be done in nanoseconds, there wouldn't be anything
left <br />
to download from.</p>
