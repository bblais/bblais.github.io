            <p><p>I'll get back to more academic things shortly, but I wanted to get this
one off my chest. I just finished watching the entire series of
Battlestar Galactica, which I did in little bits over the course of a
year or so (I don't watch much TV, so I catch it when I exercise, and an
occasional lunch time). I've always liked science fiction, was a big
Trek fan, and followed Star Trek Next Generation from the beginning
through all 7 years. I am a huge fan of Babylon 5, which I still believe
to be the best Sci Fi ever to be on television (<a href="http://www.thewb.com/shows/babylon-5">see full episodes
here</a>). Battlestar Galactica could have been that, but failed in one
very particular way which I'll get to. Other people said that I'd like
Lost, but I refused to watch it until it was done, so I could be told
whether it failed as well, which I've been told it did in the same way
as Battlestar Galactica (BG). How did it fail?</p>
<p>BG failed, not because of budget (which was probably 10 times that of
Babylon 5 (B5)), or acting, cast changes, director problems, or writing
(which is some of the best I've ever seen), but because they <strong>didn't
have a plan</strong>. BG and Lost <em>claimed</em> they had a plan, but didn't. On the
other hand, the creator of B5 shorted out all of the episodes for 5
years, so he knew where things were going from day 1. B5 is the only
show that I know of that has done that, and it is (in my opinion) the
only way to do long-running shows like these. Why does this make such a
difference?</p>
<ol>
<li>Inconsistencies. When you have a plan, you don't have nearly as many
    inconsistencies. You're not trying to hack together a concluding
    episode, trying to make all of the lose ends tie together in some
    haphazard way, because you knew how they tied together at the
    beginning. Star Trek Next Generation solved this problem, mostly, by
    not having any long-running plot lines. Each episode ends with the
    characters in exactly the same condition as they started. BG had
    some good ideas, but its resolution seemed like a hack.</li>
<li>Foreshadowing. When you have a plan, you can have foreshadowing. Not
    just vague, unexplained claims, but real references to future
    events. In the first episode of B5, a character refers to a
    prophetic dream they have about their death 20 years from then. At
    the time the viewer thinks they understand the dream, or think that
    it is a toss-off comment, but late 3rd season we see some of the
    details, and late 5th (and last) season we see the lead-up to those
    events. The flashback method is the poor-man's (or poor planners)
    way of doing this, basically saying "we need these events to have
    happened in the past, to make sense of what we want to show now, but
    we didn't think of it before so we'll show it now". BG used this a
    lot.</li>
<li>Larger Story Arc. Even at its weakest points, B5 benefited from its
    plan. A weak single episode was lifted up if it contributed to the
    larger story arc. In this way, weak episodes were improved because
    there was a plan, and the entire series seemed more consistent.</li>
<li>Rewatchability. From a marketing point of view, this seems to me to
    be a no-brainer, although it is almost never done. Once B5 finished,
    I wanted to go back and watch it again to pick up on all of those
    things that were planned, but I missed. How much foreshadowing did I
    miss? How many little details in the background were there that
    became important, but I didn't realize? How many decisions of the
    characters contributed to their final roles? How many seemingly
    throw-away lines were really important? Now that I've finished
    watching BG, I don't have any urge to watch it ever again. There's
    nothing new to see. Finding out in season 3 that Tigh is a Cylon
    doesn't modify your perspective on any of his actions in season 1.
    None of the fates of the characters can be seen in the early parts
    of the series. The so-called prophecies are each stated and resolved
    in a couple episodes, or so vague as to be meaningless.</li>
</ol>
<p>I've heard that Lost suffers from this same problem: no plan leads to
inconsistent storylines, convenient flashbacks, and an unsatisfying
conclusion with loose ends.</p>
<p>Now, B5 wasn't perfect. It could have used more money, better actors,
better dialog. It's writing can be corny at times, and there was a
studio snafu that condensed some of the plot in Season 4, and made
Season 5 a bit thinner than one would like. However, the universe is
entirely original, and the 5-year plan was just amazing and makes the
series hold up well over time.</p>
<p>I now won't watch much of anything without a plan...it's just not worth
the ride.</p>
