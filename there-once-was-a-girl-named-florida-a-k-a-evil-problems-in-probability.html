            <p><p>In a [previous post][] I described the Monty Hall problem, and noted
that a simulation can often lead to clarity of thinking on tough
probability problems. I take another example here, in two steps, and
throw analysis and simulation at it and possibly a bit of intuition.</p>
<p>I was first introduced to this problem from Leonard Mlodinow's "The
Drunkard's Walk: How Randomness Rules Our Lives" and immediately "fell
for the trap". The problem exists in two parts, the first (easy) part
followed by the second (hard) part. The easy part is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Say you know a family has two children, and further that at least one
of them is a girl. What is the probability that they have two girls?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An easy way to do this is to list out the possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Boy-Girl</li>
<li>Girl-Boy</li>
<li>Girl-Girl</li>
</ul>
<p>
so you end up with 1 chance out of 3, or p=0.33. The hard part is the
following:

> Say you know a family has two children, and further that at least one
> of them is a girl named Florida. What is the probability that they
> have two girls?
> </p>

<p>At first I didn't think it would make any difference. <em>How could knowing
the name of the child change the chances for two girls?</em> So I didn't
believe the author (at first) that the chances were even, p=0.5, for the
family to have two girls. Again we can list off the possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Boy-Girl (Florida)</li>
<li>Girl (Florida)-Boy</li>
<li>Girl (Not Florida)-Girl (Florida)</li>
<li>Girl (Florida)-Girl (Not Florida)</li>
<li>Girl (Florida)-Girl (Florida)</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the last point is very rare (two girls named the same rare name?)
we can ignore it, and we can also see that there are now two Girl-Girl
possibilities with one named Florida, rather than just one, so it
essentially gets two votes. Thus, we get p=0.5. Now, when I see
something like this I worry. Yes, it's intuitive (once you see it) but
I've seen slight-of-hand counting of the possibilities before. I don't
trust it unless I can do two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>write a simulation which reproduces it</li>
<li>show that a formal analysis works for the problem</li>
</ol>
<p>
As for the simulation (I post the code below) I get:

    Probability for a girl to be named Florida:  0.01Total number of families with two children:  1000000999862 girls (0.499931 of children)249745 both girls (0.249745)750117 families with girls (0.750117)249745 both girls (0.332941) given families with girls10084 families with a girls named florida4997 both girls (0.495537) given families with girl named florida

The formal analysis gets interesting, because I want to understand how
the frequency, *f*, of the name affects the probability of having two
girls. If it is a rare name (*f* \~ 0) then I should get p=0.5. For a
common name (*f* \~ 1) then I should get p=1/3. Not that with *f*=1 then
the word "name" is a little odd because all girls have it, so one might
think of it as a label (like "has a nose"). First some notation:

![8C429ED4-C97A-42F4-B427-4FCE878E249D.jpg][]

Applying Bayes theorem to the easy problem, we get:

![EA082732-B226-4D70-B9B0-5B88943EA579.jpg][]

The hard problem is set up like:

![D99FFC2B-0B77-4F3A-8B6D-C8640CA94738.jpg][]

It is clear that *p({L1g}|2g)=1* whereas *p({L1g},F|2g)=1* is not: given
that we have 2 girls, we definitely have at least one girl, but we need
not have at least one girl named Florida. Breaking the second term up we
get

![5B40FEDB-02C8-4803-93E3-E05B4D8E42A5.jpg][]

Now we have

![BB5BFD58-9E43-44C4-B3F1-B075AC680225.jpg][]

It is easy to check that it has the right limits:

![A4B10902-407C-4BDE-9AC4-A565F17E0FB6.jpg][]

I'm not sure if there is a better way to address this problem, but the
analysis and simulation agree, and further we have a very simple form
for how the probability depends on the frequency of the known label
(e.g. Florida).
