            <p><p>In my <a href="http://bblais.blogspot.com/2010/01/believing-unbelieveable.html">post about Bruce Hood's interview</a> I said there wasn't anything
I disagreed with. After re-listening to it, I find my position is a bit
more nuanced. I'd still like to look more closely at the experiments he
cites to see if there is anything there that addresses my concerns, like
the difference between believing in an external essence of an object
versus experiencing the memories that an object elicits. In this post I
want to address something that both Bruce and Tom dance around during
the interview: the positive aspects of superstition.</p>
<p>Tom tries to tie Bruce down concerning the bad aspects of superstition,
citing witch burning and crusades. Bruce refuses to acknowledge
superstition as a bad thing, and simply states that superstitious
thinking, combined with economic factors and political motivation, can
lead to such bad consequences. He further states that intuitive thinking
is essential for science. Science doesn't just creep forward in small
steps, but is also driven by the intuitive leaps of the scientists. Our
ability to see patterns leads us to the patterns we have accumulated in
scientific knowledge, and this ability is a <a href="http://bblais.blogspot.com/2009/12/universality-of-religion.html">consequence of natural
selection</a>.</p>
<p>Bruce Hood further talks about unconscious reasoning, such as the dream
of<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzene">Friedrich Kekulé and the structure of benzene</a>, and solving
problems while you sleep or are taking a break. I myself have solved
some problems this way, and many of the interesting physics problems
that I have used in my teaching have come, seemingly randomly, while
doing mundane things like raking leaves or taking a shower. Although he
states that he is an atheist, and is a scientist, I don't think he goes
far enough in supporting science. In this way, his omission leads to the
sense that he is a bit too supportive of the poor thinking associated
with superstition. He points out that much of it is not factually
correct, but I think he misses a big point in his exposition (one that I
am quite confident he'd agree with).</p>
<p>
Carl Sagan put it this way:

> At the heart of science is an essential balance between two seemingly
> contradictory attitudes—an openness to new ideas, no matter how
> bizarre or counterintuitive they may be, and the most ruthless
> skeptical scrutiny of all ideas, old and new. This is how deep truths
> are winnowed from deep nonsense.
> </p>

<p>It is this sentiment that is missing from the interview, and would have
cleared up many of the questions. Yes, we are all programmed (via
natural selection) to be superstitious, to see patterns that may or may
not really exist, to attribute properties to objects that may or may not
be real. Science works by starting with that, and skeptically testing
every pattern to see if it is real. It is only the ones that can stand
up to skeptical scrutiny that we can trust.</p>
<p>Thus, Bruce's "super-sense" is the starting point, the intuition which
leads to "crazy" ideas, out-of-the-box solutions. Skepticism, open
information, and honesty reduce the many possible ideas down to the ones
that are true. In some way, this is like the process of natural
selection: the "random" element in evolution (mutation, crossover,
etc...) leads to variation, and natural selection works on that
variation to produce the (far fewer) solutions that are optimal for the
various ecological niches. In science, intuition gives us the variation,
and skepticism and careful observation work on that variation to produce
the (far fewer) solutions that are true.</p>
<p>Finally, in the fine words of Carl Sagan from his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Demon-Haunted-World-Science-Candle-Dark/dp/0345409469">"A Demon Haunted
World"</a> (the best science book for the public I have ever read!):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A physicist has an idea. The more he thinks it through, the more sense
it seems to make. He consults the scientific literature. The more he
reads, the more promising the idea becomes. Thus prepared, he goes to
the laboratory and devises an experiment to test it. The experiment is
painstaking. Many possibilities are checked. The accuracy of the
measurement is refined, the error bars reduced. He lets the chips fall
where they may. He is devoted only to what the experiment teaches. At
the end of all this work, through careful experimentation, the idea is
found to be worthless. So the physicist discards it, frees his mind
from the clutter of error, and moves on to something else.</p>
