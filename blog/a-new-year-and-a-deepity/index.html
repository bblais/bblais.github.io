            <p><p>A short video by Fr. Robert Barron, to start off the new year.</p>
<p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zMf_8hkCdc&amp;w=560&amp;h=315]</p>
<p>Here is the summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>He starts by referring to what "serious theists" think about the
    word "God.</li>
<li>Points out that many use the word very differently, calling
    attention to differences between the usage by atheists and those by
    "serious" theists</li>
<li>He talks about the "genus of being", and that atheists believe that
    God is the supreme instance of that...but that is exactly what God
    is not...according to Aquinas, God is not a being, a thing, or
    individual</li>
<li>He is the "subsistent act of to-be itself", the "great ocean of
    existence from which the world in its entirety comes"</li>
<li>he contrasts this with gods, which are the supreme existence of
    being, and exist within nature...God does not exist within Nature</li>
<li>"The sciences in principle cannot eliminate God, because God is not
    an item within the natural world.  God is not some event or
    phenomenon which can be examined by the physical sciences."</li>
<li>He claims that you don't produce evidence for the creator of the
    universe, like you would for Yeti...this is a category error.</li>
<li>"authentic religion" begins with the extraordinary experience of the
    contingency of the world - the deep intuition that the world exists
    by doesn't have to exist.</li>
<li>"We know there is some reality whose very nature is 'to be' -  that
    infinite source of reality that grounds and gives rise to the whole
    nexus of conditioned things...in you we live and move and have our
    being...that's God."</li>
<li>He ends with criticizing atheists for suggesting that the universe
    pops out of nothing, and accusing theists of magical thinking.  He
    accuses atheists of dropping the question (claiming "I don't know")
    when the question gets really interesting - why is there something
    rather than nothing.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have a number of responses to parts of this:</p>
<ol>
<li>He claims that Aquinas is particularly clear, and then quotes
    Aquinas as saying that God is the "subsistent act of to-be itself"
    amongst other things.  Sorry, that's word soup, and doesn't mean
    anything.</li>
<li>He is correct that science cannot disprove such a nebulous
    definition of God.  If everyone simply took this definition, and
    went no further, they'd be deists.  If every religious person became
    a deists, the atheists would have no work to do.  The problem is
    that religious people do not stop with deism.</li>
<li>If God isn't a "being", then what does it mean for God to speak to
    people?   What does it mean for God to be three persons?  What does
    it mean for God to intercede in the world?  A personal God?  I think
    this guy believes, when convenient, in nebulous deism and, when
    convenient, medieval and Bronze age superstition.</li>
<li>"We know there is some reality whose very nature is 'to be' -  that
    infinite source of reality that grounds and gives rise to the whole
    nexus of conditioned things...in you we live and move and have our
    being...that's God."  - Notice how easily he moves from nearly
    content-free deepity speak, and then slides in "...in you..."
    implying a mind, a person, a relationship.  This is the jump where
    he is claiming to know things he cannot know.</li>
<li>I'd further add that the entire claim in the previous point is
    something he cannot know.  He refers to philosophical <em>intuition</em> of
    the contingency of everything (including the universe) but has not
    demonstrated it to be true.  Until then, "I don't know" is the
    proper response.</li>
<li>The only reason anyone speaks like this at all is because religion
    has lost its authority on nearly every level (medicine, history,
    astronomy, physics, biology, etc...), so that no one can take the
    stories seriously anymore.</li>
<li>Just because something lies outside of nature, if it affects nature
    at all it can be tested.  This has been done with "miracle" claims
    (healings, visions, resurrections, etc...), efficacy of prayer, and
    models of the cosmos - and they have been all shown to be wanting.
     Thus, it reduces the probability of this interventionist God claim.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to retreat to a non-interventionist God, in principle immune
from science, no problem...but stop claiming that that is somehow a
victory.</p></p>
